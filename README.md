### Project Description
As Singapore eased into the reopening of its travel borders, there were mixed reactions among the citizens: some with excited, while others were concerned about the additional COVID-19 variants that travelers may bring into the country. Many citizens looked to social media platforms to voice their opinions through comments.

Although the implementation of the COVID-19/travel border policies, we feel that public opinion can bring value in the follow-up policymaking to empathize better & serve the citizens, helping the government provide more citizen-centric public service solutions.

Our team aims to discover the concerns that Singapore citizens have about reopening our borders, namely the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL) Scheme through topic modeling, as well as sentiment and emotion analysis.
