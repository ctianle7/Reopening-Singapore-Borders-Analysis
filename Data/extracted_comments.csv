Comment
so many questions by commenters unanswered. i for one wanted to know if foreigners who had entered singapore are able to use the vtl.
can i know how much in total for vtl flight including all the pcr test for per pax?
why is there a pcr test in klia airport? it does not make sense since a test was already conducted in s’pore prior to travel.  the msian gov sure know how to make it difficult for travellers. poor malaysians working in s’pore. they have to pay a lot of money and waste so much time before they can get to see their family.
im fom vietnam and i want to flight into singapore. but then i want to get into malaysia by land? is it possible?
how long waiting after swab test?
so this is only possible for singaporep and my residents? if i’m an international tourist can i enter malaysia via the singapore vtl?
hii what about cost summary
?
do you have to book the pcr test at klia before arrival?
"yes, you should!"
i will land in singapore 2th jan 1am and flight to kl 9am. how the best way to book pcr test?
lydia's  where to book?and got link?can i book 2 days before my flight?
"i would like to get some info on this too, no link to book and no reply when contacting authorities"
how much pcr test?
i'm working at going back to kl for good. family comes first. there are career opportunities everywhere. it's crazy time now with lockdowns anytime and there are so many procedures to be carried out each trip we go back to kl😰
stupid singapore government to open the border!!! those traveller are bringing in the old and new virus omicron in!!!so selfish of them never think of others safety!!
is this restricted to singaporeans and malaysians only??
not much of info . pertaining to how much to pay ? can we pay on arrival ?
"you can, but you will face the queue. rather pay ahead since it's the same price.."
趁火打劫
"to all malaysian and singaporean, welcome to malaysia 🥰"
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
"balik kampung….dan kepada semua warganegara, selamat pulang pulang marilah pulang bersama sama"
expect omicron.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0suiq1lo1ci&t=1m30s1:30 welcome omicron to home
not like europe countries
hi.. do we need to print the boarding pass in counter due to vtl flight???
"no, you don't need to. i used my handphone, i flew today"
how to get to express lane for pcr testing?
good.
how much in total was yr flight sin/kl cost. mind sharing? tq
how to i entitled the express pcr lane? any more info regarding that?
the price were more expensive
thatsawesome how much?
kwai ying han rm 350 for 1 hour. rm 250 for 3 hours waiting time.
c m a fantastic beautifull news chanel singapoor ♡*😎
omicron is coming
sound like megatron from transformer.
expect lockdown !
they should expect another worldwide sudden border shutdown and full lockdown effective  q1 of 2022 due to omicron spread.
america is garbage and don't do this

the flight ticket is considered cheap compared to pre covid festival season ticket.
thanks for sharing
sponsored flights by scoot cos they trying not to go under.  a lot of foreigners n india money in scoot.  pr stunt at its best 👍👍👍
another channel to transmit omicron
"why not pass a law called ""no thumbing down on youtube channel state media news?"""
this move was made by youtube themselves. all videos can no longer be disliked.
"seanan lin junxi can, just not publicly available, only for the creator"
news shaping public perceptions?
"lets not forget the older ones who may not havce the means to be adept in using of social media to book tickets ,etc.  the fastest finger wins?  the govts should look into this and help them. those who wish to go back to malaysia."
who everyou...good job ..thanks
great job indeed.need courage
all this for 600plus dollars 😆 waste of money
it's not mandatory.

next life that's not how it works.
way to go 👍🏻
you already have 1000s of cases. who cares  just open
why no vtl with philippines?
slowly brother
because they are noisy
singapore is heading for big trouble. unless you. pm lee set it side succession and continue to be prime minister till the age of 75 year old and after that become president of singapore till the age 85.
looks like singapore pm can only come from the familee. either his wife or son will be groomed for that position soon. 😡
i got a feeling that his son will follow his footsteps meaning that his son will be the 5g pm after hsk.
actually life is easy but they always make it hard.. 3 yrs already we face this but still the same🤦‍♂️
agree with you bro its fear that actually make the whole world life difficult
who should send a teams to investigate usa fort detrick lab. unit 731
why don’t you email to who and recommend them to investigate this lab since you feel so strongly on this issue? give them the reason why you think  they have to look into this matter and appreciate your update here in youtube any outcome or response from who
millions of american are living in fears and sleeping in road side with tents and canvas
singapore has made the right decisions to become covid resilience and to open vtls with as many countries as possible. our economy and sanity depend on these vtls.
pls open singapore - jb borders as normal for  vaccinated travellers. everything will be scary until you don't face it! let our bodies produce antibodies to covidtrons same as other poor countrys peoples!
it's been long close borders please let the borders open give us the life of working family shopping food many more which we have been deprived vtl too many test and cost are very high with 3jabs should be relaxing the movement. thank you
indonesia dan singapura bisa satu asean
please open borders and our lives will be normal we have to move on we should move on and johor and singapore borders and  reasonable test as long as we have taken 3 jabs we should step forward and be brave to face it thank you
we should refrain travelling from gulug to another gulug.
meanwhile hk is falling behind sadly....

vtl is still too cumbersome. since vaccination does not prevent infection you are likely to test pcr +ve without even knowing it as this virus is super transmissible. when this happens overseas on arrival your vacation is finished. if you come back and test positive - your job is finished. fully vaccinated does not reduce your risk of catching covid - just less likely to be hospitalised or die. fools tend to rush where angels fear to tread
just here to pui the disingaporeusting oppigs
well done my friend 👏👍
travel at your own risk??
why so eager to travel? really think it’s ok or die die must travel. just imagine if anything goes wrong and you are stuck overseas.
overseas safer than here.
this one will caused more virus to spread hope we do not infected people.
more n more planning a 1 way ticket out of singapore🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👍👍👍💪💪💪
good riddance🤣😅🤣
vtl is not the only way to enter singapore.
what is the point of a new broadcaster just telling people to refer to the website?  might as well not say anything.
we are going to have 10000 per day soon. just call it ceca variant simpler.
single party - where is accountability? i think is a big mistake.

"with scientific justification as above, please stop gambling recklessly the peoples' well-being and life-safeties away, particularly when in view of the omission or avoidance to publicly assure singaporeans no long term bodily damage from covid19 infection regardless of mild or no symptoms.  as we recall from prof leo; from prof leo [executive director ncid]; ""basically, we do not know ten years, twenty years down the line. which strategy gives you the best, we don't know, and i think the important thing to know is that we do know how the covit19 virus can damage the body, and the effect can be long lasting although we don't see it, so we don't know the price that you pay, the immediate price versus the longer-term price.""  as i have said multiples of times before; vaccination should never have been used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. stop the imports from higher-risk countries and the leaks into the communities. safe guard the life-safety of all singaporeans, particularly the younger ones, elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority."

yess!! my sister is a doctor and according to her and confirmed by many that pcr is never designed to detect a virus. all these scaremongering for almost 2 years is complete joke!!

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl with malaysia, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
open border but singapore  migrant workers  cannot going outside 😀😀😀😀
"anyone know if singapore will open a vtl with srilanka,india , pakistan etc soon"
why is the cost of pcr test in singapore very expensive?? singapored160. in india is only inr980 = singapored18. in japan airport is only usd17.

when indonesian can get through the border without quarantine?
well said 👏looking forward to travel again🤩🥳

what if singaporean go overseas and get covid. will they able to come back seek treatment?
"mass import for the asymptomatics. they cannot comprehend how big other nation is n the implication of all possible transmissions… stats already show vaccination or not still spreading, worse after six months when less protected."
"most countries are in the covid 19 level 3 (high) to level 4 (very high) range. that is why our government need to move our pandemic to the same levels with them so we can logically open up travel with these countries, mainly for economic benefits."
the best !!!
"this is not i think, it is from all burmese = bema= my judgement = amargeddon"
even open to uk and europe only  5 % singaporean can afford to travel there

when will open singapore to india border? pls reply sir
maybe earliest in 2025.
found a reason to permanently ban
boba fett 😂😢
24.5% of india are fully vaccinated?
but i really dunno why not for malaysia
can take boat or train to malaysia so no need vtl.
"one of the frontline doctors, dr raymond yuen has passed away due to covid complication. this virus is not flu!!! please do not downplay the pandemic"
is it pnuemonia ?
"understand they are trying to revive the aviation sector and airlines.  not sure if they are helping the local airlines or kill them unknowingly.  if they can achieve the revenue per seat miles, which i think is dicey, operating costs can be curtailed, else it's pressure mounting more flights, these are mostly long haul city-pairs."
singapore airlines must keep their motto a great way to fly and not  a great way to die
why no vtl yet for asean countries? these are your bigger trade partners
you want vtl to india or bangladesh ?
"us, with such a low vaccination rate gets a travel pass. shows the privilege that some countries get in singapore."
our largest investors will have privilege.
"eric km i don't know how you measure investment by a country but the last time i saw, china and malaysia are larger trading partners of singapore and indonesia is a close 4th."
"kl rider we already open to china (hk), just china close to singapore (cn need zero covid case which singapore definitely not), indonesia as well, singapore interested, but indonesia not sure about singapore (due to our current high case), but they are considering (hopefully indonesia say ""yes"";). malaysia wait for my green light right, don't know why still waiting (my; singapore both say interested, but waiting for what ???) dr m spoiler? screwing up the vtl between my; singapore? bro, not for singapore alone to decide. our cases so high now, we want open up with other people, other people also have to consider carefully. western countries care less about covid, mask, social distance, easy to have  vtl with them.and also looking at the mncs in singapore that hired the most local workers, which countries are they mostly from? china?, indonesia?, malaysia? us? uk? japan? korea? eu?"
eric km largest gun has its priority.
markt n 😁
wait for more die.
nice
singapore government don't care us anymore. no lock down
now it's not about the cases in various countries they are bothered with. they are getting connected for the new world order one world government with opening up those vaccinated get all excited thinking they are fulfilling promises
deleted and http://reposed.lol/reposed.lol
pls open border of india
🚷wait. our pm say we need another 6 months for covid situation to improve.

"boba fett . monitor every 6 months, that what our gov like to do.."

what do people from the us do when they have no smart phone only the official card?????
"singapore sell i-phone, they shop here."
"well done,  singapore"
"americans won't be visiting singapore, why? because average americans don't even know where singapore is. only wealthy americans will visit this city state for businesses. mostly asian american business people or scientist."
"you are wrong. my neighbouring family is an american couple, who are not visiting, but living in singapore. of course, an average american does not know where is singapore, just like many an average singaporeans have no clue where is bratislava. however, there is this thing called google map that you can look up should you need to know for some reason."
more us companies investing in singapore. us companies in hk also moving more of their operation to singapore. cheer! 😁🤑🥳 us factories in china shifting to india. apple drop 30 chinese companies from their global suppliers chain list. singapore may fill in the gap for some of these.🦾
why us? how about your asean neighbors?
they have high vaccination rates. asean still struggling.
great news!!! i can visit my family again

yes us is very safe lol
please open the country thoroughly asap!
i am waiting for malaysia vtl ..... why take so long???
malaysia is not listed
maybe dr m creating some problem and opposing it?
"endemic for foreigners,enhanced phase 1 plus for local residents ."
what about own citizens working oversea? typical singapore govt prioritising foreigners again..
only who dares to be nosetrils swab!
can i say we all have to live with covid. covid will not go away. we have to transition to living with covid now. we gotta open up at some point. it's almost been 2 years. they are other diseases we need to deal with.
we already open our borders...to heaven and hell...no vaccination required...god bless singapore...we will come strong after covid19...death nos not important...economy important...cos we got no natural resources...good reason...we will work together...get over this...long live singapore...thanks to all the ministers...
sir having heard all the requirements but i need to know the process of applying to visit singapore in november. please attach the link to enter singapore. appreciate dd
i'd rather go jb. not interested in europe
"purpose is to support sia, not singaprean place of interest🤑"
this is what happen whenyougot a team of gov who only care abt $$$ over ur life. this lee gonna lead us to doom by depending so much on others than own
why are all the travellers from the west?
is china hk tw macau sk are from the west ?
"china. taiwan, hk covid too low, so they see singapore as a dangerous, infected nation."
boba fett that was already in placed before this.
"a new song for all singaporeans to sing from now till election day so as to remind you of not to vote for the pap.  title: f lhl f lhl (while holding up both middle fingers) (2 slow claps, followed by 3 fast claps) repeat above  the song is designed to be sang everyday in every occasion until the resolve inside you rages and motivates you to cast your vote against the pap on election day."
oh yeah only 3000daily reported covid infection honestly ???and opening the country what do you think
"border control makes sense only when you don't have it locally, like china, new zealand etc. if it is spreading like wildfire locally and infect 100% soon (the us is close to that stage already) then obviously external visitors are no more a threat than any local. this is the day i knew will come sooner or later since march 2020"
"us , uk , spain have not been able to control the covid 19 virus again to very high risk usa , uk , spain ,  australia , india , japan etc ."
freedom of doing whatever they want (democrazy) the virus also has the freedom to out spread. 😂
"usa no ah, alamak!"
"soo tuck choong vtl with us good for our business, why no?"
covid cannot be controlled so live with it.
soo tuck choong vtl to india ok for you ?
"now it's asia africa era. go to africa , look how silk road innitiation  is making ethiopia prosprous ! black americans already left for ghana because african americans are better of in africa now."
sjeline lukiman what about the safari ?
same goes for singapore. no? we need to be in the same shithole group so that the governments can reap economic benefits from opening up.
astor  would much rather be in the “shithole” group that is looking toward the future and past the virus. would you rather be in hong kong where cases are incredibly low but a return to normality is not in sight at all?
singapore case per capita is more than those listed countries.
"awaken princess  yes but singapore boast they are well planned , world's highest ministers with worst performance as usual ."
"really open now to 8 more countries... to benefit the public? it's seems very convenient to be just in time for the bloomberg new economy forum, scheduled for nov. 16-19 in singapore - come on, just speak the truth!!! if you really benefit singaporeans, open up malaysia, thailand and indonesia for vtl."
vaccination rates in thailand; indonesian are low. malaysia should open up though.
"singapore is open up for wealthy indonesians seeking medical check-ups and quarantined in 5 star hotels with 26005$ for 2 weeks guarantine. wealthy indonesians arriving on private jets are welcome as long as health department allows them. their private ou ctors will arrange it with the authority at health ministry. and they will stay at 5 star hotels of course. auerage indonesians are better stay at home than spend their money there. indonesians are welcome though in the netherlands. and after 2 weeks in amsterdam, they can travel to the rest of european countries."
"it is to support sia, purely business. 🤑 money face, if you want to put it that way.😁🤣"
extends leads to higher virus in singapore .
many traveling out of singaporean because other country they are safer as lesser cases of covid to land area ratio.
agree
now i'm in canada ok 👌
exactly
those who still serve house loan not be able to leave.this is the time not to buy any property everything not certain if you lost your job bank loan default you be in trouble.
"singapore need to have more varieties of the virus.  why stop at delta? let the rest come in.... mu, lambda, ... come on down !"
yes like a buffet
borders opened for uk..wow...with 35k cases daily...
this is why they open to uk so that singapore can have more covid cases. can increase .foreign countries can produce f10000%fake certificate which looks more real than real certificates .
"relative to population, it is fewer than singapore itself on a per capita basis. this is the day i was waiting for, when there are enough local cases, then border control will make no sense. it may make sense to china, new zealand, australia etc. and they can stay in their bunker for eons to come. but glad that singapore seems past that stage."
high vaccination rates & doing booster jabs for over 50s. deaths is below 200 a day. covid will not go away. we have to learn to live with covid. can't keep locking down.
heaven god oh uk producing fake certificate..i didn't knew this..thanks for enlightening me..and how does it matter because at singapore airport there will be another test
uk ?? why should we go uk ?? brexit has totally destroyed uk...its no longer a place to go to....56% voted for brexit and 56% are deemed racists....worst still uk cops rape and murder civilians...and now lead by crazyhorse or sittingbull......sorry better go to thailand or any sea country....
"per capita basis,please educate yourself 🙄"
seems all are well planned but we are dealing with types of virus which could easily spread. verifiable cert issued by these countries are questionable there is no 100% guarantee it is genuine. we are actually taking chances hoping all this measures taken works smoothly. don't be too confident. reopening the border need to be dealt with carefully. we can't afford to make mistakes. politicians will always be politicians it's our life they are risking.we are concern.
we need vtl between malaysia and singapore. family ties that matter. please consider
singapore isn't ready for many countries. their verification method are questionable. don't take the chances.we need to be sure.
family ties travel lane again?🤔 then how about vietnam?
eric phua vietnam??goshhhhh
🍿 cornerany friend from china. flooding badly over there. https://youtu.be/mve4xa-ypfihttps://youtu.be/mve4xa-ypfi
"entertainment is the biggest industry needed anywhere. singapore now has no more clubs,pubs as such. you opening your borders to these foreigners without the entertainment you might as well close it. anyways since non vaccinated is not allowed to dine in than why shut the fnb business at 10.30pm. is there a problem with increasing the time to at 12.30am?"
errr..  are you asking vtl for vietnam?😆
is maid in &; out matter not important? how we local to move on live with old folks or babies but indonesia is not in the list of opening travellers too pls.
"nowadays open border for one country become political problem, not healthcare or science problem"
dont agree
it's purely business🤑. all companies and country interested to invest in singapore are welcome.
👏👏👏👍👍👍
from us?! make sure they’re fully vaccinated!
most are too busy in settling their 2020 election fraud and any sensible american would think twice before they stepped out..the ones who did would higher chances would be lack of brains supporters of ice cream sleazy cheater joe..
"they are clever at frauds whether open or not, they'll find a way. and of course, the government is good at sucking up the supposedly ""power country""."
"remy azhary yosef  i rly don’t understand why singaporeans have an issue with this ‘sucking up’. when you’re a country as small as us, of course we have to suck up! without the help and money of these countries, we can’t sustain ourselves. take a look at australia, they decided not to suck up to china and accuse them of starting covid. and look what happened, china imposed a crap load of tariffs and australia lost out on a big source of export revenue. we need these countries on our side"
its called vaccinated travel lane.
coldbrewed the unvaccinated what about us? which lane do we take? are we even allowed to book flights ?
starlite 77 why would any country takes in unvaccinated when they are struggling with vaccinated.
hopefully all kena &; die. end of mankind.
"they are not safe because they are not vaccines.  it is actually a bioweapon (graphene oxide) best defense for disease keep your body alkaline eat a healthy diet take vitamins there is only 1 disease, malfunctioning cells and it's caused by toxins and deficiencies"
when singapore and malaysia border will open ?
i want to ask before the border was open we already detect the importer virus from arnt these ppl already vaccinated? now if we open the border are importing more
bs
india when it is likely
wait. countries with more investment in singapore will get vlt first🤑. we will give japan and rest of eu countries first.
any news when it might open
the vietnamese government has violated human rights because my wife has vietnamese but i haven't been able to meet my wife for almost a year now. there is no country in the world that has an uneducated stupid government like vietnam.
"no come, no come. one come, three, four come. (saying in hokkien)."
finally can meet relatives in malaysia in europe 😆…. good job minister iswaran for getting things done… us go to uk still need to q.o 10 days…very proud that  singapore is one of the first country to have so many travel lanes to major countries… just need japan & malaysia … bangkok too
"tourists can enter singapore, but if they are not vaccinated, are they allow to enter the mall?"
"as a hong kong resident who works in singapore occasionally. some of my unvaccinated friends wanted to come to singapore (there's no shn), but i advised against it as you mentioned, they won't be able to dine out or entering malls."
"fully vaccinated tourists, my friend! watch the video carefully!"
"the title tells it all...it is ""vaccinated travel lanes"".  if the unvaccinated are allowed to travel, then is the country who ""exported"" them fault liao."
wong francis . hk is welcome.
wong francis thats crazy can't believe what this world has come to. discriminate against people who haven't had the vaccine wow.
"starlite 77 i agree with u. although i'm vaccinated, but i respect the choice of not getting it too. it's a mad mad world we now live in, sadly."
when it will be possible to travel from switzerland? thanks for asking in advance
i think when fully vaccinated people hit 80%. right now only 60%?
"johntora1 thank you. we are fully vaccinated, but lots of people in switzerland don’t want to have the vaccine. they are afraid of loosing there freedom….can’t understand this."
"since swiss banks are here in singapore, hence swiss are welcome. 😁"
"no, it’s still not possible to fly from zürich to changi airport! it’s unbelievable: i haven’t seen my grandkids and my family since nearly 2.5 years!!!"
"wilma mohn just needs a bit more time to finalized vtl with rest of eu, japan etc."
"eric km i hope very soon! my grandkids are growing so fast, haven’t seen them for mor than 2.5 years!!! it’s so very sad!"
wilma mohn 👍🫂
eric phua ❤️
"remember guys, many of these ministers have the highest and best education. smartest too. from gep. from raffles. they will think of the best research for us all. we may not like it but those who hear the music are declared insane by those who do not. i myself have an iq of 102. average man. am a clerk. but i admit my failing and am happy to be led by wise men. we will be good."
"i mean it's nice they open up, but how would visitors from these countries feel when they can't dine out in a group more than 2 (suppose they come as a family of 3, 4 or more) ? not exactly an ideal way to spend one's vacation. this is even if you're ok to bear the high cost of pcr tests to by pass quarantine."
i don't really think the vtl is meant for families who are going on holiday. it's more for businessmen and students at this time
"actually, there are many attractions still open in singapore that tourists can enjoy. for eg. the 2 integrated resorts, universal studios, zoos, museums, gardens by the bay,  singapore flyer, duck tours, river cruises, food centres, etc. the dream cruises, caribbean cruises are also available for booking. only perhaps the karaoke lounges and some nightlife outlets are closed."
"levin jr i mean sure the leisure, fnb industry (which did push for the open up) will care. i don't care to be honest, as i haven't been to a local restaurant in two years anyway. i am just happy to be able to travel to some mask free destinations."
levin jri don't understand the joke. every country has its own sovereign government that determines the policy actions driven by prevalent political winds. what is funny or surprising here?
"bali is welcoming visitors as well, i'd rather go to bali."
singapore still don't realise that there are many breakthrough cases in countries which use mostly m-rna vaccine . letting them into spore will infect more sporeans. the wrong vaccine was chosen for spore national program and they still don't understand why the figures are soaring even though 80% are fully vaccinated.
india epo flight broder open painnuvaga sir please please
open for india in year 2095.
hippie geek 🤚agrer
🚷only countries with investment in singapore will have vtl for now.  we have enough workers for now. wait. our pm say needs 6 months for covid situation to improve. any companies want to invest in singapore are welcome. we will help vaccinate you and your staffs.
when open for indian already done vaccine 2 dose
in your dream.... 🤣
for investing countries only at the moment. next will be japan and rest of eu countries. 🚷 india wait.
eric phua how long any idea
"racism, xenophobic activities, paranormal humming by oldies against brown foreigners will become low.. here after.. let the dogs go out of borders."
iswaran finally making himself useful by appearing in the mtf conference!
since when he's been useful  ?
vincecarlo much more useful than you
abang adik in green on their pmds haha
who ???....
big bs.. just open up to whole world to anyone is vaccinated.... if you keep using this vaccinated logic.. damn nonsense
"c19 virus is cumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered or fully vaccinated. currently vaccine is incompetent due to vaccine maker adjust to be safe, so the victims rate is drop after vaccination. litigation is applicable now after politicians fully approve the vaccine. this is great liberty status evolution. a lot of people having long term serious reaction even death in vaccination before, and the politicians still do not want to tell the truth."
wake me up when we can travel to malaysia or china without quarantine
china is already without quarantine from last year
"maulik madhavi ""travel to""; not from. it depent on malaysia and china call. not for singapore to decide."
"maulik madhavi not true. i was quarantine for 14 days in shanghai last year but this year, they require 14+7 days home quarantine which means 21 days in hotel for foreigners like us. unfortunately, it is still in force right now."
indonesians also want to come but the government has to postpone the travel bubble after a surge of cases in the nearby city state..
"all these vaccinated lanes are blowing hot air only. just look at the number of airplanes sitting on the tarmac can see. just look at the number of pilots on no pay leave can see. just look at the people getting in and out of changi airport can see.  trying to discriminate against the unvaccinated, you received tribulation."
us has more death and infected people than anywhere else. if malaysia belongs to china or the us...it will surely open up. such a racist government.
clearly the  ministers lack spine to repel us pressure. just wayang to surrender to us demands by including others.
countries with same politics are uniting...
who already mentioned that vaccine e-passport don't work. you people are smarter than who?
why is this task-force not made up of both private sector and medical sector?
"we are still waiting for malaysia border to open, hopefully soon"
i thought uncle joe advised us tourists not to travel to singapore because of the high number of covid cases even among the vaccinated? he changed his mind because that will destroy the theory that vaccination works?!
how about china?
1 hour old account. 🤣🤣🤣
"anyway please come for short term tour only. have to return to your motherland after 21 days. with or without covid, you still needs to leave after 21 days"
china is busy with taiwan now.
"in order to dine out or gather with more than 2 people, we have to travel overseas"
restrict citizens n open up for more countries to come in.  tell me how many deaths in those countries thatyouare letting in?
when can go china 😭😭
"just go, if china allow you. singapore not stopping you."
eric km a lot of men already miss their mistresses in china. lol lol
janice leong fy .singapore allow travel from china &; hk but china &; hk did not reciprocate. i think their relationship likely end up the same💔
singapore situated in europe continent now 🤣😎.
super. monthly paid 100k but full read from script….😂 and he looks uninterested and sleepy 😂 omg
all puppets
honestly singaporeans can’t help but complain about anything and everything. is a criteria for ministers speaking without a script?
is this reciprocal opening of vtl or just one sided from us? can we travel to those 8 countries under same arrangement?
answer is in the video
"farland789 thanks, maybe i miss that part. pls help to direct me to the correct timing on the video to listen again."
"speaking during a press conference on saturday, transport minister s iswaran said the vaccinated travel lanes would restore""two-way quarantine-free travel"" between singapore and the eight newly announced countries. as per cna article"
"yes, you can go on tour to these countries."
best news in a long time. thanks
welcome anyone in the world to test their covid resistance in one of the world's most covid cases.
😂
then the unvaccinated and the seniors will be more restricted in times to come. they will be punished more severely as more vtls are welcomed with open arms
"if vtls are in group of more than 2 people, think they are free to move about and dine in, right ?"
"how about malaysia, w r also vaca...ready...usa also high covid case..."
"china , hongkong ,macau open up our covid increased lol"
"if you cannot lift up the restriction then opening travel lane is not an option, all the small and medium enterprises is suffering with even tighter measures and you brainlessly opening up for more country, you boast to have the highest vaccinated population in the world and everything else is way behind those country. your vision is pretty bad as you only see what is good for your gain and many people is unemployed here as this people does local people business in heart land and have no benefits from your stupid travel lane opening. they won’t died of covid by will die of hunger."
"suggestion: singaporean coming back to home country  should get a free or a subsidised hotel accommodation. limit to once or twice a year.  heard that these nations gets free accommodation returning to their nations for working professionals working overseas. don't know if it is true.... the nations are... ""korea, japan, thailand, philippines gets free accommodation when they return home, subsidised by their government. why not singapore?🇸🇬"""
"great news, but if he have helpers in the house does that mean current shn is possible only for people without helpers?"
malaysia?
"malaysia government still don't want ,but johor royal is pushing already"
irrelevant. allowing msians in provide no beneficial to singapore's economy.
"blizzaroxxx your ignorance is astounding. malaysia is one of the top contributor for your tourism. may you not know, those millionaires from malaysia, indonesia and china love spending money in singapore..lol"
these newly opened vaccinated travel lanes are like the salad bar in a buffet .. no one cares and makes no difference.
"8 continues can cme here spread, but we got no chance to spread, sounds fair to singapore ministers fucxxx, fuxx off don't talk please, tell us something to make us happy"
excellent speech by minister iswaran cos indeed we need to open such vtl for usa uk canada europe country and possibly australia and nz to boost our economy
"haha you apparently you don't listen to the news about financial oifficulties in usa, uk, australia, canada. indonesian business people are much more wealthier. perhaps in your mind, americans are bill gates, mark zuckerberg, verawang, elon musk, 😂😘😂 well these people think big, they go to monaco, switzerland, luxemburg not singapore."
sjeline lukiman who cares ?
more vtls means better days for frontline workers like tour guides and healthcare workers.
what about malaysia which have very high vaccinated rates now?
high vaaxxed higher deaths and infection rates too.....nooooooo
samson no delilah how about united states? covid case and death higher than malaysia
who will want to come singapore with such high numbers of daily cases?
lots of peeps with moni
might be nato military forces
"i was planning to come (from hong kong),but my singaporean friends advised me to postpone, as we won't be able meet up easily at home nor dine out."
"you never know until you see the numbers. the german vtl flights have impressive load factors. many westerners are already living without masks, drinking beer while cheering at jam-packed socker stadiums and clubbing like there is no tomorrow. you still think the covid case numbers are the deciding factors whether they come? it has always been the protocols that are the deterrent, never the case counts."
the imperfect perfectionist . then we must open up night life to welcome them.
"eric phua i cannot comment on that. i care about travelling out quarantine free, hopefully to some mask free destinations. whether they are coming in to singapore or not that is no concern of mine. but i also like work from home. so an ideal scenario is quarantine free travel for locals but and locally full circuit breaker"
the imperfect perfectionist . now you can enjoy europe maskless 😁
let’s live with sinkor variant  stock up food  eat healthy and exercise  get ready
i thought it's sindia variant?
book already
"hello, thanks for this good news! could you please consider to exempt babies from the rules? lots of us have babies and need to bring them around when travelling :) thank you"
babies should stay at home while adult do the traveling so get a nanny and solve the issue.
yes definately.😁 welcome to singapore.
sia website down already. congrats 🎉
good news!
well done singapore. be resilient.
"when puppy lift up one of his back legs, you know what he want to do."
"opening up more lanes is a booster shot to increase covid 19 cases.   for such a tiny country with 5.5 million population,  the daily infected percentage is high.    the covid 19 cases will climb to a level,  nobody will come."
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂 youcan open as many lanes as you want.   who is coming?  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
well there are many coming in.

"the whole of europe, the us and korea have thousands of cases everyday but people still go about their daily lives as per normal. life goes on but feel free to stick your head in the sand and hide at home."

scandinavian countries when? 🤔😪
"actually most of western europe, eastern if you dare  ...all can travel for vaccinated with no issues for months ago.. issues is coming back only."
"why on earth do you look at vtl quarantine free based on country cases? fully vaccinated travellers if from other countries not in your list, fully vaccinated family members from the whole world should also be under vtl quarantine free! you are heartless in your consideration. family matters always come first!"
🤑 it economic consideration.
"dear sir, kindly consider india to singapore vaccinated travel lane,we fully vaccinated 3 months ago,have valid work pass, waiting so long, please consider us.🙏"
"dhanabal singapore got 4000 covid cases india cases going down why you  indians take risk to come down, ppl from china coming already since june this year covid started from china you still want come here you must be mad"
"🚷wait. other countries with more investment will have vtl first. the rest have to wait.🚷 singapore has high unemployment for local now and we have enough worker at the moment. our pm say wait for another 6  months from now, for covid situation to improve. hopefully everything back to normal in 6 months time."

a lot of people want a good lifestyle but the way they spend can't see them get that lifestyle anytime soon the better  rich invest more and spend less
i invested in both stock and cryptocurrency but i see crypto doing more better and profitable to me
investing in cryptocurrency is one of the best chance of making money 💸
i wanted to trade crypto but got discouraged by the fluctuations  in price
that won't bother you if you  trade with a professional like mr walter peters
i heard that his strategies are really good
"my first investment with mr walter peters earned me profit of over $250,530 us dollars, and  ever since then he has been delivering"
he has really made a good name for himself
"i got sir walter peters info, how good is he ?"
"expert  walter has been managing my trade for months and i keep making profits every week, i made $97,130 last week"
"peters has been managing my trade for months and i keep making profits every week, i made $85,130 last week"
he's really amazing with an amazing skills he changed my 1.2btc to 6.1btc

"my first investment with mr walter peters gave me the assurance that have made me invest without the fear of losing, i got four of my friends involved with him already"
"i've got 12th winning thanks to mr peters he's really the best, i've made £160,400 in 18 days working with him"
"yes i can believe that, i got victory with him, i was so sad after receiving the first try knowing i invested so low with fear😓😫"
"believe me  he's the best when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, your profit is assured."
mr water peter helped me and i'm a billionaire now 😎💰
is the new .. if you give me 35 secs ... guy?
why taiwan is not in singapore extension vaccinated travel lane?
do you have a brain?
why? because taiwan is like a sweet maiden whom ugly china trying to woo or maybe abduct and rape . you surely don't want handsome singapore boy to be involved in a love triangle do you?😂
yes if you are vaccinate with their own medigen (高端）
becos taiwan won't reciprocate. taiwanese not stupid.
"what type vaccine do taiwan have? recognise by who? only vaccinated person can travel. how many taiwanese vaccinated?🤔 if taiwan can take the risk, you are welcome.😁🤑. we in singapore have high covid cases anyway. if taiwanese companies like semiconductor want to come and invest in singapore, please come and singapore will help to vaccinate you and your staffs.👍"
why not sweden?
it’s based on economic importance. not health
you can transit via germany with 14 days transit.
tua pui kia germany has more cases than sweden doesn't make any sense this.
rest of eu will be next.
great job singapore. please don't go back on these border opening measures. i hope public can understand that the number of cases doesn't matter when vaccination rate is more than 83% already. icu occupancy is only 23.5%. there is no need to panic based on the case numbers as most(98+%) cases have only mild or no symptoms.
great comment. hate those paranoid folks with extreme fear
hopefully your family or you will be in icu even you are vaccinated. lky died in flu?
绿水青山 so you wish somebody to go to icu because they have a different opinion than you? wow great mindset. whats your alternative?
绿水青山 dude lock yourself in your house! don't come out at all. you might die! there's something called covid 19 going on. do the rest of us a favour! don't come out don't come out!
"shukri ram ram lee burger no matter how you open, the gdp in 2019 was 1.x%. the opening don't help much"
qy seah  so would you like for us to stay closed off from the world forever? idiot
all about money money n what else . it seems clowns likeyoujust love to see more people getting covid . it must be good if people like you get the virus . then we can see what happens.
we can expect at least 1 new variant incoming.
sinkor variant
india will start complaining about singaporep variant.
"what you want is money, money and money, nothing else"
yeahh duhh to keep the economy floating so that singaporeans won't lose jobs! simple economics! didn't learn before?
james jr  simple but not for fools
rs lin frfr
james jr don't be so simple mind. the gdp of 2019 was already1.x% and many sme were not is good shape for the past few years so it doesn't matter opening or not opening.
"绿水青山 yeahh the gdp growth worsened in 2019 itself, even before the pandemic! by closing down, we are going to keep smes completely out of business. by your logic, we are going to completely crash the economy and not be able to recover from it any time soon! forget about smes, even big techs and corporates would stop their investments here. our nation is running because of foreign investments. if we lose them, we are screwed.thankfully our government isn't that stupid"
"james jr yes, they are stupid. keep the pandemic dragging that make many people whether sick in home or hospital or people quarantined at home. do you think mnc happy to see that?"
"绿水青山 keep the pandemic dragging? you seriously think the government has complete control over a pandemic? 😂😂 look at history, there's no such thing as overcoming a pandemic through restriction measures. you can have complete lockdowns for 6 months and still not be able to complete eradicate the virus! that's the reason why living with the virus is a more logical approach compared to zero covid! life has to go on. too many people have already lost their jobs. can't keep it going like this"
james jr  i will get sr to address your problem
james jr  you my friend are a man of logic
else how to pay most expensive pm on the planet n  $660k/annum to mayors for dunno doing what  ?
money money money always money in singaporean minds
绿水青山 wow.... talking about logic and commonsense..... you need to buy yourself a brain.....since you are so smart..you have a solution to end this pendamic? or you are just the typical brainless ibm that love to kpkb at everything???
"風林火山 i don't have solution but you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it. in fact the border was already opened but you don't see much passengers in airport. the only different is they don't have to be quarantined. i can tell you that us companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient. if too many high rank ang mo staffs get it in here and coughing, how can ensure the business continuity."
james jr you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it. in fact the border was already opened but you don't see much passengers in airport. the only different is those ang mo don't have to be quarantined. i can tell you that us companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient.
"風林火山 i think you have to worry about sph and mediacorp. opening can't help their business. ntuc fair price you also have to worry, people can buy rice and other stuffs from other platform and cheaper service charge"
绿水青山 you are a joker... hong kong can don't open border because they have their grandfather to support them... can we? taiwan???  you must be kidding right? no scan no case... they still got to beg for vaccine.. you don't know meh?? you are really so simple minded.....
風林火山 you people are just coconut with four legs.
绿水青山 o by the way..since you are so so so smart.... please share us your great plan and solutions on how we can end this pandemic????
風林火山 you can ask hong kong and taiwan how they make it. ong ye kung thought he would be the vice pm and seek advice from taiwanese politician 朱立伦 via george yeo's introduction. so simple and you don't know?
绿水青山 you can't think? o... i forttten you don't have brain....
绿水青山 their solutions is not solutions.......
"風林火山 not solution? in the first place, you let people from risk country walking freely is a solution. you don't freely screening the whole red hell to quarantine the carriers, that is a solution? there are four fully vaccinated persons died and one of them is around 50+, that is your solution? there are several  cases caught on a flight by other counties, that is your solution?"
绿水青山 hello...i really can't blame you... without a brain... it will be tough for you to comprehend simple logic. is long-term lock down  a solution????
绿水青山 you must be the male version type of karen...... what is vaccination for???
"風林火山why you don't ask there are more than 85% of people vaccinated and why there are more than 3500 cases a day and why there are vaccinated people died everyday?   in lab environment,  the efficacy is higher than 90% but those volunteers were selected from healthy  people but in practice, the efficacy is around 60%. vaccination can only reduce the seriousness of the disease. even flu, there are people die in flu every year, especially in cool countries. flu can turn into pneumonia as the phlegm can stuck  in the lung. this is basic medical sense and people from cool counties have much concern of it."
"绿水青山 lol.. so what is your point? don't do anything? continue to lockdown and close border? as long majority of the vaccined ppl don't die from covid, we should just press on an open up just like the rest. like what you have said... we will sooner or later die of something... please don't spread lie, according to medical research, you will stand a higher chance to survive if you are vaccinated.. get it karen.."
"風林火山 i don't say ""lock down"". it is you stupid people incompetent to identify covid-19 carriers and quarantine them and make the place safe. i already said border was already open. i spread lie? you can check with hong kong and taiwan gov. how many passengers from singapore tested positive at prc? do you read news paper how many fully vaccinated people die so far?"
"風林火山 the birth rate of singapore is 1.0x% and the increment of eligible voters of last ge was more than 10%. where are they came from? you people keep on importing voters, even taxi drivers also know that."
"風林火山 do you know that how many people die in flu every winter in us, rustic?"
绿水青山 bla bla bla bla..... o dear.. karen is singing again....
"绿水青山karen, what took you so long to reply?? busy watching youtube to get ""knowledge"""
绿水青山 do you know what is a flu vaccine? i think not.. cause you are karen..
绿水青山 karen..i am so so sick of ppl like you.... every damn thing is about politic... whole day can only  open n close your big mouth to bad mouth singapore and the effort so many people had put in. do me a favour.. make your self useful..... please...
風林火山 i don't know what is flu vaccines? kidding! do you why people look for sinovac?
風林火山 i don't think you can read what i sent to you.
绿水青山 i don't read rubbish... especially from karen

風林火山why not you take off your mask and walk on the street
風林火山 do you know that singapore has became international laugh stock? well toad.
風林火山 why singapore need expat because you people can't think.
"绿水青山o really?? from my ""chinese"" name you  can tell if i am proficient in chinese  or not? so smart? too bad with an ass behind it..."
绿水青山 wow.... you are so so karen..... not only you talk trash .... your thinking is rubbish as well.....
绿水青山laughing??? you mean laughing at ppl like you??
風林火山 are you the next nobelist?
風林火山 you are really well toad.
風林火山 the education system mould you people lack of ability to think independently. singpore need another 10k years to have its own nobelist
風林火山 people laugh you  people incompetent to handle the situation and the pandemic is out of control.
绿水青山 bla bla bla..... complain this.. complain that..... not happy with this... not happy with that..... uncle.. life is short... take it easy...  enjoy the little moments in life... appreciate and don't take things for granted........ you are the grouch in real life... good grief.. get a life
绿水青山 ppl laugh at ppl like you... yep.. sure is the case.
風林火山 that you cannot think of other hing to say display you are not well educated.
風林火山 you either be the next nobelist or lack of ability to think independently. which one?
绿水青山 talking and referring to yourself? dear karen?
風林火山 猈
風林火山 i have said so very things including sending you the document from international research center and who. how can be the same?
風林火山 you can travel to hong kong or even prc if you like provided you don't mind to be quarantined for two weeks and going through swab test.
風林火山 i'm so sorry to tell you that a doctor die today.
绿水青山 my deepest condolences to the good doctor family. as for you karen... go get your booster jab.
風林火山 you people are responsible for it.
绿水青山 you mean you
绿水青山 o karen...... o karen...... you are so entertaining....
風林火山 you people are service provider and do the lousy jobs; we are the clients. you people should be blamed and why so unhappy and why should laugh at me?
風林火山 even a bai kar could run faster than you. why it shouldn't be an international stock to laugh at?
風林火山 i have nothing to do with no. 38. why people should laugh at me?
绿水青山 bla bla bla..... talk rubbish & trash to start your morning routine?? yet to take your medication? karen karen.....
"風林火山that is you, not me."
绿水青山 you mean not me but you? ok.. we are get it karen.
風林火山 you keep on repeating you need medicine.
"绿水青山 so typical of your kind, only you can repeat your rubbish???"
風林火山 i ask why lhy sold his houses and reply me you need medicine.
風林火山 biden looks younger and energetic than your big boss. pls don't reply me you don't have brain and you need medicine.
風林火山 싱가포르의 4세대 지도자들은 제대로 된 사람이 없다
"绿水青山 karen karen..... you must be looking forward to every morning so that you can start your rubbish and trash talk.... let me  guess, you must be the kopitim lau uncle type... lonely and not happy with everything??"

風林火山 la cuarta generación de líderes de singapur no tiene líderes decentes
绿水青山 i am beginning to take pity on you....
風林火山 none of singapore's fourth generation of leaders is decent
绿水青山 they are 10 x better than you karen... nato.....
"風林火山 when your so called expert said that don't need mask but we already put on masks before 2020 chinese new year and washed with detto sanitizer; when ki chew laugh at hong kong people washing masks, chief of hong kong slam him indirectly."
"風林火山 you people farted on jurong town's plan but jurong industrial park is still mota;  you said you want to build 5g but you people are still not aware of what it is, where is 5g now; you wanted to entice ppl from prc to gamble here but it seems like the two casinos are almost closing down."
绿水青山 talk n talk n talk and stil  l talking... but no action.. you do best karen

風林火山 probably you may get it tomorrow.
绿水青山 don't mind cause i will survive as compared to you karen
風林火山 who know?
of course for survival. why are grumbling here if not for money reasons?
only for rich countries...
yes we are a rich country
🤑🤑🤑
what the f you people
"wait wait wait, visitors from united states without quarantine? with the current situation of more than 100 thousand cases a day?"
yes the great usa. sad to say this but what us want us get. and the singapore government won't dare to say no.
"yeah, and our close neighbours like indonesia and malaysia which is well under control, with the former even having daily cases lesser than singapore, they keep closed🤦‍♂️"
modhaki kamynt must listen to big bro
hisham amir and whyyoumay ask?
"pm already said , sooner or later w will meet covid 19 , as long you vaccinated and young got higher chance to survive"
willie lim does not really answer to why they let countries like us and uk in where their cases have skyrocketed but yet prevent our neighbours from across the border from coming in
"hisham amir vaccinations rate , all these countries are rich and have higher vaccination rate then most countries"
willie lim ifyouwatch the video then he mentioned infection rates as one of the crucial criteria. yet us and uk good to go.. but of course you want to make up your own criteria: rich🤣
"hisham amir if talk about infectious rate. , lots of asia counties should be first. data won't lie. , sad to say , we need more $$ now then ever."
"singapore is an asean member, should lead by example and secure vtl for asean region first."
"ykw, good luck to all of us. i'm from indonesia and bali is doing the similar no-quarantine scheme."
"""from oct 19, fully vaccinated travellers from canada, denmark, france, italy, the netherlands, spain, the united kingdom and the united states will be able to enter singapore under this arrangement,"" please present the full info. don't nit pick."
"thulomanchay umm, everywhere in the world including singapore, those who have been vaccinated are still infected by covid, some of them even died. especially now the united states is the epicentre of covid, i'm just questioning the decision that's all. but go off, i guess."
us & europe infection rate is not better than singapore… don’t know why they say europe is doing well & spore has higher vaccination percentage…just that these countries are less concerned with daily  infection cases
hisham amir most probably yet to have mutual agreement with other asean countries.
objective is to support sia revenue first. it is just purely business decision.🤑
"precisely! and here, we r restricting hawkers n kopitiam. disingaporeusting"
"willie lim need more $ but spending more on consequences, real smart!"
sjeline lukiman it is not right to say that because germany with more cases as well and brunei are the first two countries that singapore has vtl arrangement with. both have opened up with singapore. so it depends on mutual agreement. if the other country disagree then vtl may not has happened.
markt n  the restriction is to protect unvaccinated individuals and reduce the strain on singapore healthcare system.
aisyah ramadhan no quarantine because they are required to take covid pcr test on pre departure and upon arrival. also have only been to vaccinated travel lane country/regions for the past 14 days before departure to singapore.
haiden din that’s only a theme nyouare buying into it easily. diff betw 2d and 3d mindset.
markt nit is up to you want to buy or not but the intention is there or else cases will definitely go even higher and no reduction.
i just heard from a youtuber that jack ma and his wife moved to singapore. is jack ma from uk or usa????? money talks and billionaires talk louder.
"if lee kwan yu was still alive and kicking,  he would have done it differently. he even dared to bark at cia in usa on harvard's campus . his party members esp. his son are so obvious sucking up to the former anglo-saxon colonial masters. so is india at the moment."
ivermectin works
brain dead
"walker tan brain dead is when you keep trying the same thing: masks, lockdowns, ""vaxx"" - and expecting different results. get a grip."
and now rebranded by its creator as covid pills 😂😂😂
"walker tan even monoclonal antibody testing in florida, us could work genius..so whos the brain dead now loon?..pharma spellbound your mind much huh?"
pap's policy on vaccinated travel lane is risking the introduction of mu variant into singapore. it is the beginning of an end. pap is going to kill thousands.
why not bangladesh
not that much rich country. they only open for rich people...
right
corruption ridden countries no allowed. if they can sell their mothers they'd sell vaccine certs.

"i met mr benjamin  last year for the first time at a conference in manchester, i invested £25,000 and traded in one  month making close to £143,670"
"second shot pfizer vaccinated returning singapore citizen fm europe or second shot pfizer vaccinated returning singapore citizen fm asia is different? even pcr before flight boarding, pcr landed in airport. pcr before release to the street. the different is 14days jail in the words of politician.... any hidden agenda? pcr multi test not accurate? singapore citizen.... 2nd?"

"grab singapore stopped all rostered routine art testing  dear delivery partner,  please note that the last day of qtc testing would be today, 17 february. given recent changes to rostered routine testing (rrt) all appointments from 18 february onwards would be automatically cancelled as fdrs will no longer have to undergo rrt from 18 february onwards. riders are advised that they will not be receiving any cancellation notifications.  this is per moh's press release on 16 february 2022, rrt would be streamlined to only focus on settings interacting with vulnerable groups and selected essential services sectors from 18 february 2022.  ....... we still strongly encourage delivery-partners to stay vigilant, do regular self testing and visit doctor when feeling unwell."

"ever since the start of the global vaccine rollout in january 2021, some experts have been crying out against mass and rapid vaccination of populations in the midst of a raging pandemic. if they are right, this will go on creating more variants and prolonging the pandemic. so far, it is looking like it, and god help us! thank you cna for this report and with this song of hope i pray for god's swift intervention to end this pandemic: https://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbghttps://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbg"

"until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them, this drama will continue. the disease isn't that severe as projected by the media. they are trying to create the social credit system by fooling the people in name of covid. social credit system is the ultimate slavery. every person will be assigned credits. people with low credits will be refused access to shops, malls.. etc. you see.. in emerging set up where people are granted access based on vaccine status,  they will soon replace the vaccine status with credits. so basically if a politician wants to commit atrocity and you oppose it. he can easily isolate you from the society by lowering your credits. imagine the power that you are handing over to the politicians because of your stupidity. still think it's all about the virus??? 🤦"
oh so not for citizens but foreigners...
what about outgoing travellers?
our present government can do whatever they like. even when they are voted out they still can take up jobs in the government policy making job. the choice of the citizen is not taken into consideration at all. democratic of one man one vote to get the appropriate person to represent us is taken lightly.
"whatever, anyway viruses have everywhere since we are born to this world just because of politics and business make it life more difficult just take care of our families good and safe our lives by our own way should be ok"

"just to get it. if i´m healthy according to the rules of back in the old days, like really going far back in history, like back to 2019, i can not enter singapore as a random healthy not vaccinated foreigner? that will prevent a lot of business people to come and deal another blow to the tourism industry."
"it all depends on what restrictions other countries have. singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia (among others) did, too. it creates a competition for tourist dollars,  investments etc. basically, opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others, triggering a virtuous cycle. it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions. if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements, then singapore will likely follow too."

"unvaccinated peeps are not welcome le, stay out. we reject retrds"
"19k cases yesterday and yet today simplify rules for travelers. open doors for covid-19 to come in is stupid, repeat the mistake is stupid, believing in pap is stupidest."
so what?! 19k so what?! majority are having mild symptoms! look at our poor businesses that have suffered from this pandemic! if we do not allow the tourists dollars to flow in how will they survive? they will end up dying of hunger or worry whereas majority of vaxxed c+ patients will not die! guess who's the stupid boy!
petrus you are very selfish! just because you are afraid of this and that you decide that the right thing to do is to sacrifice others' livelihoods. that is blatantly wrong

no words for stupid people.
"cases need to rise for lockdowns or travel restrictions to lose their effectiveness. so it's a reason for celebration. only a rising case number beyond control can force abandoning restrictions. examples plenty, european countries, australia, south korea, vietnam etc. i said since the beginning, the pandemic will last as long as restrictions last."

"south africa already over omicron despite low vaccination. we r giving it to children, god bless!"
the case numbers don't matter anymore considering omicron is the most mild of all the variants. deaths from omicron are rare and it's treated as a common cold unless you are the singapore government are nothing but cowards.
"just a champion crushing your dream actually it might turn out that omicron has not mellow down but appear to seem so due to vaccination n natural immunity from past infection as they both appeared to hv almost the same strength in clinical data from us, europe n israel."

opening up brings in more tourist dollars what does the easing of restrictions bring in?

"good thing. the more we open up, less will be the incentive of closing border. as he clearly said, when community cases rise, closing border losses its effectiveness. that is what we need to break out of restrictions and travel bans."

"ideally everyone should be socially responsible. however, in reality , human is always flawed, when it comes to discipline. just like a simple task of wearing a protective mask. how many will comply?  stay home quarantine is even more difficult to comply. what's stopping a stay home notice person from venturing outside the common corridor to water his or her plant.  can people stay home for several days without the temptation of going out? talk is cheap , its the walk that is the challenge."
"our g is very smart, con and corner 80% to take experimental drugs for big phama and secure investment deals with them, both gov and phama co legally not liable to be sue,  at the same time show the world we are highly vax and now open for business,  one stone kills 2 birds."
our g is absolute fool. the smart one is nothing but a gang of highly educated new world order mafia in collusion with the bigpharma and bigtech. such dysfunctional g brings nothing but suffering to the citizens.
why would people want to travel for pleasure  in the thick of covid19 pandemic? one need to wear mask in public and restricted number in dining in or groups. in addition need pre-event test at some venues. moreover delta variany infect both vax and unvax. does this sound like fun?
"lelaki kena pegang nasihat ni ——————————————— kita ni biar pandai.jangan memandai mandai. tuhan tak jadikan alam ini untuk kita buat suka suka kita je. tuhan suruh kita baca.baca diri kita. baca alam ni. madu apa pun, semuanya baik. penawar segala penyakit. kecuali mati je. cumanya orang kita ni cari madu tualang tu, sebab lebahnya kuat. boleh terbang tinggi. makin tinggi sarang lebah, makin tinggi khasiatnya. kita pun kena jadi macam lebah.ada sengatnya.tapi kerja buatnya hasilkan madu. lebah ni,kalau dia nak hasilkan madu yang baik, dia kena cari bunga yang baik.macam tu jugak kita. kalau nak jadi manusia manfaat. kena cari ilmu yang baik.ilmu yang berkat. kita ni kena tahu.kena belajar ilmu empat tampil tu. belajar ilmu agama,ilmu jati diri kita. kuasai ilmu kepimpinan untuk jaga keluarga dan masyarakat kita. dalami juga ilmu kesembuhan untuk rukun zahir batin kita. simpan ilmu pertahanan, untuk bela agama,  bangsa dan tanah air kita.  kita ni….siapa kita ni?  kita ni hamba tuhan, umat muhammad. empat empat ni kita kena ada. baru sempurna jadi orang laki laki. kalau takda? kita nak tinggal apa ke cucu cicit kita? nak pimpin keluarga,macam mana? nak sembuhkan orang yang sakit, pakai apa?  nak jaga keluarga , nak bela orang kena zalim, macam mana?"
i guess i will start traveling after 1 more year.
this is a sure and rapid way to annihilate the merdeka generation. well done trash force.
more old folks have died but government denied covid cause.  funeral companies are booming and arrogant in pricing.  curse the 4g clowns and retribution will serve justice.
depopulation process is undergoing.
"hello  lambda n mu; both resistant to vaccines. booster jab ain't gonna save u, just put ur life at higher risk"
please open slowly.
nice background 👍🏼
sonu
"should hold an extraordinary election to see if singaporeans give the mandate to keep opening borders, live with covid and call it an endemic.  testing every other day is not our idea of living as normally as possible."
gahmen think singaporeans life too long izzit?
why not jest lockdown
why not jest lockdown
we look for vaccinated travel lane between singapore to india 🙏
demark is running a full trial for us to study as they fully opened and ditch away masks at the vaccinated rate of 74%. its been a few days since they goes back to pre pandemic. lets hope they will do well and we can follow them soon.
"more travellers coming in more viruses will spread, look at the prison cell, how come there is also virus going on? who spread, local, what more overseas imported, nobody knows where the virus starts.for business its certainly vital for us"
new backdrop makes harianto more handsome
nice backdrop! looks more interesting that the office background
"1 : 900 =&gt; 1000 amongst 900,000 travelers, at its peak just need 5 days. implying 1000 : 5 days [based on previous peak]."
for almost two years quality of life was being sacrificed only stay at home and takeaway meals risks getting covid no social gatherings  so sad
in the other news : no quarantine travel opens
only 1 tested positive?? a negative test at the airport on arrival doesn't mean he will not test positive later while going around spore
it's all just a drama clear that one to justify entry
why is pfizer and moderna not debutting new vaccine against new variants like delta.  obviously the current vaccine is not working as it is based on the original covid 19 virus.  sinopharm is debuting new vaccine against delta
"i ask so many questions that leaves me more confused or insulted example. im healthy with a strong immune sytem,  based on the ""experts now""  with the vaccine you can still spread the virus.. why do i need the vaccine if ive just recovered from covid? did the test that showed i had enough antibodies but was still strongly suggest to get the vaccine.. ps im not an anti vaxxer nore would i tell anyone not to get vaccinated"
yeah that's why i opted to get the sinopharm one to get the gov off my back it generates a much weaker immune response and thus a lower risk of any severe side effect. honestly if the gov wasn't such a pain in the ass i wouldn't have bothered getting the vaccine for a 99.8% survival rate virus.
otw to 4000 cases per day. soon all singaporeans will be covid recoverers or victims. pls note there are two variants that are not affected by vaccines.
which 2?
are you very happy when the community cases are rising??😡😡
nowadays don’t come out too many video of news also.  not transparent
do more testing
its because theres still ample space in hospitals for covid patients
"if there r ample space, they do not need to resort to stay home recovery"
"be very careful with travellers from south asia, especially dubious indian covid numbers. do not be so naive and allow flood of travellers from there."
you must be drunk to comment indians are coming lol dont even anything just comment anything you like
"(before the vaccine arrives)  ""vaccination to prevent covid infection""  (after fully vaçcinated yet still infected)  ""vaccination to reduce the risk of severe infections""  (after infected and worsened)  ""vaccination to prevent death""  (vaxxinated, infected and died)  ""vaccination is the only way out of this pandemic""  the conclusion:  obviously, the purpose is only to help vaccine manufacturers to get data. not to save people lives."
"yes,  narrative changes"
sharp and clear summary
clear n concise  👍👏👏👏
"interesting analogy,youforget 1 thing, vaccination to bring in alot of $$$ to its manufacturers!!"
this just proves that those behind such narratives is nothing but fork-tongue serpent. tony fauci is their foremost representation.
"""does it provide immunity?"" ""only to the manufacturer"""
"too many airport terminals, so lan2 have to open border"
🤦‍♀️
"singaporeans have never been consulted with ""living with the virus"", and it is solely the miw decision. these episodes clearly showed citizen life-safety and well-being are secondary in the eyes of the miw."
"lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there would be leaks from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “risk” because as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore?  and during that time, not many singaporeans were even vaccinated.  to make the matter even worse. mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew.  why must they keep importing from higher risk countries?"
ttkoh123 they just want $$$$$$$$$$$$$
they just want money

welcome to singapore. welcome to come and live with the virus and sleep with the virus
when open border for bangladesh now bangladesh  covered 19 less
the biggest risk of opening up fully is --;    opening up for new virus variants.
"des chan your existing post is already very unpleasant so i strongly advise you to refrain from showing an open-up's a-hole.  don't do it, des."
"the risk is now highest ever; the butterfly effect. unmistakably, the covid curve is no longer flattened but gone into overdrive and hit above 1000 cases."
"for those fully vaccinate,  it is naive and dumb to think you guys are risk free from dying.   at best, it merely lower the risk.  as total infected number increases,  the risk increases accordingly."
"viral load for vaccinated isn't reduced  vaccinted have a false ense of confidence  if vaccines really works they should  be able to move around without mask n no social distancing.  but nooooooo, 90++% infected are the vaccinated  mrna is a just a lousy crappy flu jab"
"icu or critical cases is a percentage of total infected.   regardless of fully vaccinated, single vaccinated and unvaccinated   its still a percentage of total infected in each category.   death rate will definite increases as total infected shoot up.  is someone out to destroy singapore?"
like the new setting and smile😃
"clearly,  covid 19 is predominantly spread by fully vaccinated.  deliberate opening up travel lanes is intended to push the total infected number to a new height,   putting singaporeans on unnecessary risk.  that is an irresponsible and selfish act that need to be condemn."
mrna is the virus ? else why 90++% vaccinated are the infected  ?
"vincecarlo mrna was developed for initial covid 19, not variant d.   thats why vaccines is not working !!!"
vincecarlo even the booster shot was for initial covid virus
karma please take care of those who made decision to deprive others' lives
"i see you comment a lot. in your expert opinion, what is the best economical, geopolitical & healthcare solution to the crisis?"
octob3r singaporexmy ask mp n ministers
des chan then don't whine and bla bla when you know nothing and can't bring anything constructive.
octob3r singaporexmy whine? bla bla?🤣😂🤣😂try refute my comments.  should be easy since i know nothing
octob3r singaporexmy constructive comment?  for u? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂wat for?🤣😂🤣😂
"as i have said multiples of times before; vaccination should never have been used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. stop the imports from higher-risk countries and the leaks into the communities. safe guard the life-safety of all singaporeans, particularly the younger ones, elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority."
"1 : 900 =&gt; 1000 amongst 900,000 travelers, at its peak just need 5 days. implying 1000 : 5 days [based on previous peak]. also in -cubation period = direct let in to the communities. with failed measures after measures from promises after promises, how to trust? these days, need to be careful with their mind manipulative and maneuver techniques.  in any case,  singaporeans have never been consulted with ""living with the virus"", and it is solely the miw decision. these episodes clearly showed citizen life-safety and well-being are secondary in the eyes of the miw."
agreed ! 👍
finally the authority now know whose travellers they can trust in complying with covid-19 protocol.
finally a fresh backdrop 👍
i’m candidate for president of singapore- total reform needed
"president of singapore have no political power other than being a figurehead. it's silly for so many years, there are singaporeans and not just some, still don't know about this..... if you want to reform, run for the primer."
"viking ok primer it is- as long i go and help my oppressed singaporean’s , they say we singaporean’s are one but they devide them in simple personal decisions on not taking vaccine- they say they wan to protect unvaccinated that’s why they not let us in restaurants- but if insist they will put us in jail- is that protecting"
purpose is for ceca.   foreigners always first priority.
exponential curve + opening up wider = ??????   is somebody out to destroy singapore?
"des chan  just relax, don't need to open wide at all."
"it's your arse profile picture that give you this problem.  it tempts that somebody so take my advice and remove it, des."
"des, better take care of your a-hole seriously. that someone's  debehaviour is abnormal, wanna destroy your a-hole is definitely unacceptable."
welcome a new variant soon.
only 1?
hi singapore my homeland❤..i'm in germany..thank you & home soon dont worry i'm fully vaccinated💉😊
"fully vaccinated. but cannot prevent death right ! singapore - former national footballer mohamed noh hussein is in hospital after suffering a heart attack on sunday morning (sept 19). the 67-year-old former winger, who was a household name to many singaporeans in the 1970s, is understood to be in critical condition at sengkang general hospital."
now you can see why they literally tell you to self isolate!! they gonna get busy with more travel lanes  and locals go deal with the problems on your own!!
this is not about health. this is about new world order agenda. globalist infrastructure.  business and tourism. they want to build the system where everything has to go through them. without their permission you cannot do anything.  it is about the infrastructure of control. it was never about health.
palm trees  it's never about healthcare it is a global agenda nwo great reset sustainability and the forced mark of the beast will follow soon in the name of buying and selling!! revelation 13 v 16-18 prior to that economy collapse worldwide!! then the beast system/kingdom!!
call us to stay home recovery to reduce infected peoples into hospital.  all these is to get more rooms for travellers that come in and if get infected for them to stay hospital. because they can't continue stay in hotel if infected and they home is not in singapore.
"god's amazing grace  search yt with keywords ""lee hsien loong new world order"" the first 2 videos. one of them is even from prime minister's office (pmo) official account. our ""beloved"" singapore leaders are aligned with nwo. no more a conspiracy theory. right out from the horses mouth, in the open already."
"well said, obsolutely true. tis is their priority.."
"wong kok kiong , well said.. exactly indeed."
palm trees  he is definitely in it !! thanks for sharing it is obvious that the singapore leaders are in alignment with the nwo.agenda!! it's dark and evil !! ai dominion transhumanism nwo started with the virus ordered to do things like don masks social distancing safe entry etc then the deadly vexsin!! next 5g digitalization forced mark of the beast in the name of buying and selling!! people who don't believe it's the nwo  will call it conspiracy theory!!
"god's amazing grace  the buzzword they use is “multilateralism”. if you watch the video, lhl says there will be more serious pandemics in the future. (how does he know? unless he is in on it.) anyway, this war is a spiritual war. going by your username, pray to god. i saw in a dream that your prayers can foil the illuminati’s plans. i saw them in a dream panicking and asking why isn’t their (satanic) rituals working? they cannot manifest the result they want from their rituals."
"palm trees  bill gates ""disciples' speak the same sing the same tune fear mongering virus has gotten the mases well under control!! globalists illuminati freemasonry all bible prophecies coming to pass quickly!!! the great tribulation is coming soon !! matthew 24 v 21 revelation 12 v 9 anti christ in person!!"
1 case is 1 too many - remember how we got to this dire situation?  you guys never learn your lessons do you?
"singapore can not close border forever.  i think we will all kena covid at some point. it is only a matter of time. covid 19 is going to be as common as influenza, not only in singapore, but all over the world. we will have to learn to live with it."
"lai fong chan have you heard/read about mu?  well in my book,  only the loki variant is welcome haha……"
"fully vaccinated. but cannot prevent death right ! singapore - former national footballer mohamed noh hussein is in hospital after suffering a heart attack on sunday morning (sept 19). the 67-year-old former winger, who was a household name to many singaporeans in the 1970s, is understood to be in critical condition at sengkang general hospital."
sang nila utama pendekar he has passed on...
when open bangladesh border now bangladesh corona less ready
areyoukidding....just stay there. thanks+
when you are ready to invest 1 billion usd the borders will be open for you.
you should ask your government when can open.
"australia, new zealand, korea please. really wish to travel again. singapore too hot and humid. japan only if their infected cases drop drastically."
daniel lim actually singapore is hot and humid the whole year except perhaps the rainy days. i used to travel abroad to enjoy the cooler weather and the natural landscape. really miss all these.
totally giving up to eliminate the number of cases?  still allow entry and exits?
it should be  obvious we can not eliminate the number of cases for covid 19.    we have to learn to live with covid 19 just like we live with influenza.
"the plaque took 8 years while spanish flu 2 years.  it’s not impossible to neutralize a pandemic with proper containment. everyone must do their part, just like how wu lien-teh create his task force to contain the previous plague."
lai fong chan stop saying this bs
primate classics b.s.? i think it is you who refuse to accept reality.
"橘_デル_tachibana ya? ，look around you. protests all over the world against masks, vacinnes, covid 19 rules and regulations. in singapore, many people still go to malls, outside. many people does not live their lives  with containment."
"lai fong chan yes, we cannot eliminate covid because of ppl like you"
let wait for 1500 daily cases and everyone will afraid to step into singapore😁😁😁
brush
that’ll probably happen in less than a week
wrong priorities
from the start till now. totally
"totally agree. priority should be to investigate fully vaccinated cases and yet suffered sudden heart attack. fully vaccinated. but cannot prevent death right ! singapore - former national footballer mohamed noh hussein is in hospital after suffering a heart attack on sunday morning (sept 19). the 67-year-old former winger, who was a household name to many singaporeans in the 1970s, is understood to be in critical condition at sengkang general hospital."
global agenda new world order
"our hospitals are running out of beds, virus spreading like wild fire, moh hotline not able to get through when we call and still wanna let people in?"
economy first people last.  efpl.
"just my thinking , if those airplanes still stop flying the engines will stop working soon. then it come with big $$$ for replacement."
carl jay   economy and people are closely tied together.  perhaps you are super rich or happily retired...
"mindtwister , no i'm resilient and diverse."
"carl jay i have no doubt in your strength and resilience but not many people can bear having their business shut down for more than 3 months or even 6, with mortgages to pay and inter-generational families to feed."
"mindtwister , the thing is ; as a business operator and business minded, knowledge of global trends from geopolitics to potential pandemics as well as other unforeseeable circumstances that can be expected to happen, should have been anticipated, expected, preempted so that diversifying and switching of industry can be done at a drop of a hat sustaining negligible or recoverable losses.  i foresee a future of largely online based businesses."
carl jay  capitalism adheres to natural selection. so economy 1st and people last so that makes your point. don't blame the government for your own failure to switch.
"mindtwister , i'm not talking about personal abilities.  i'm fully adaptive.  it's the loss of love ones of other people the world over, which governments are to be accountable for coveting economic rescue than their own citizens."
"carl jay then you are contradicting yourself because you do know most people are not as ""fully adaptive"" as you.  so the markets will crashed hard and furious if the government left it to its own devices.   in fact, most governments understands that the economy and the people lives are closely intertwined and they are walking on a tight rope. neither are inconsequential although it is perceived that way."
"mindtwister,  humanity in and by itself, is contradictory.  but to unbecome what we all are in order to live together as one species is apparently not written in stone.  either we all find our senses collectively or perish by our own ways.  i'm talking about a lose lose scenario.  no prize trophies await neither of us."
why urged everyone to reduce social gathering when you want to open up borders for more tourists... just let everyone to live their lives as per normal lah...
"...yes, and let half the population die abnormally."
"again. 900 vs 5million , 1 covid vs 1000 covid, do the math. borser cannot close forever . stop spreading your bad political agenda all over youtube"

"it is 'urged' only. no one is stopping you if you choose to ignore the 'urged'. from the looks at the big crowds at the shopping malls, many people are ignoring the urge."
"lai fong chan , which indicates that the administration in charge knows not the people they govern."
double standard measures.  🤣
mtf....good job n thank you!🤩🥳
"with 80 percent of the population vaccinated for covid-19, attention is now moving towards booster shots in view of the waning protection over time. should we use the same or different vaccine? just remember what the great scientist albert einstein said: ""insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result""."
i think you are very irresponsible. you care only tax $$$$.
ridiculous. govt allow unvaccinated from hk and taiwan to come in and no need to serve shn. allowed to roam around and mingle with locals. but sbs ask their vaccinated bus captain to lunch alone and not to mingle.
kleptocrat
boosters my foot
so end of the story singapore despite tax payers paying premium salary to leaders but the outcome is same as every third world country which is can’t evade death when infected at least to minimal. recent fatality numbers in my opinion shows the management has failed!

travel at own risk...allowing tourist in also at our expanse.....jiak liao bee task force....
so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds? all because most will be dead as the new normal? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay. we expect more than that! everyone of us singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly!
"allow to open borders for a groups of tourists  in, but singapore only allowed 5 person gathering and dine in!!! so are the tourists oso cap at the group of 5  too??? since tourists are allow to come in big groups so when we are able to go out or dine in groups of 8???"
so tourist welfare more important than singaporeans welfare? or singaporean citizens can be bullied and pushed around and shoved down our throats!  so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds? all because most will be dead as the new normal? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay. we expect more than that! everyone of us singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly!

hope you can ease the sports criteria on the maximum number of players that can play at a time. open up on the booking of indoor courts and increase the numbers of players that can play at a time. same for outdoor too.
very clear direction. that is why we are the envy of many countries in the region. well done singapore. i am very proud to be a singaporean.
covid has eaten your brain dude.
"i just don’t understand why are all these people up there talking, while the specialists & experts just typing on keyboards."
there are many things in life that one cannot understand if he is a cynic.
waste of tax payers resources. we don’t need spokesmen with no value add! we might as well use money employ top scientist!
"don't know what the true intentions of our government, but from all the reports i have seen, vaccination does not protect you against covid. there are people who kena covid positive even after taking 2 doses of vaccination. the government still think he can fool us when there are people who died after taking 2 doses of the vaccination."
greed
singapore ministers very easy to do. everytime has things just tell everyone this is the new normal. when singaporeans citizens fatality increases significantly they will continue to tell us this is the new normal and live with it? ignoring precious life’s of singaporean whom trusted them is incorrigible!
fed up with them. but 60% still blinded by their little angpow b4 ge
jiak liao bee
referring to yourself?  this is not a communist country. no need to do self criticism
bmpcos jiak liao bee
so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds? all because most will be dead as the new normal? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay. we expect more than that! everyone of us singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly!
90 mins of ministers wanking each other and giving no solutions to tackle covid. rather watch a match that has 5 goals of the same time than this
no value add! waste of tax payers money! so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds? all because most will be dead as the new normal? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay. we expect more than that! everyone of us singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly!

no symptoms and spreading
it's the science. no symptoms also can spread. that's why vaccination is necessary
bmpcos vaccinated gets no symptoms
old lee  who says?
bmpcos gov
old lee  lie again. sometimes i don't understand.  you can disagree on policies but you are not entitled to spread lies.
bmpcos you all keeps lie

it's all about keeping people confined and controlled. obeying the system. well we're the sheep's and the politicians are probably following the orders from 1% ( protocols of learned elders of zion).
“journalism”.
gov job is to protect the people lives first. not protect the money.
unvaccinated will not die from vaccine. period.
stupidity at the highest degree!!! well done!!! paint the story that you want but the fact remains the vax also got hospitilized!! wait till the vax start dying and see whts your excuse next.
"the best thing for everyone to do now is  to stand united together , ( not for national day ) to do a  najib  & a muhiddin  😬 , like malaysia - medeka for true democracy ✊ 👊  🤜😫🤛"
bruh the vaccine isnt supposed to cure the virus 100% and its not even supposed to prevent it its supposed to make symptoms less bad like 96% of the time
"singapore showcasing their distinguished panel of unmasked covid primate "" authorities "" again  🌋 🥳🤡  🌋 🥳🤡  🌋 🥳🤡  🌋 🥳🤡  🌋 🥳🤡"
their reports and what's actually happening on the ground is totally different. how is it that they can lie with a straight face? the f...ing borders was always open. the number of deaths was  a lie. please look at the bigger picture and stop lying. give the population real news.
"proud singaporean here. don't exactly agree with mr lee methods when i was younger but as i grow older, i start to see where he is coming from more and more"
shouting lies show weakness
we deeply appreciate all the works of every minister to keep the people save and the economy to thrive as well. it’s a balancing act that needs skilful wire- walkers.

"the late lky took a chinese philosophy “衣食住行” as the basic needs of a functioning society. people need “clothes” on their backs, “food” on the table, “roof” over their heads, “infrastructure” to move around (sea, air travel and local mobility-roads). then to develop education for the next generation and healthcare. his draconian approach definitely irked the western media but he really could not make mistakes at that time. his vision for a new country and political clout with foreign dignitaries had helped singapore to be a success."

"so i read in the straits time that travellers from macau, hk, china need not serve shn upon arrival in singapore, regardless of their vaccination status. this means unvaccinated citizens from these places are allowed to enter singapore and actually roam around singapore if their pcr tests are negative? so are these unvaccinated tourists allowed to dine in at f&b establishments (including hotel f&b) or are they excluded from the current regulation? how are hk and macau special that the citizens need not be vaccinated to enter singapore, apart from that they are sars but singapore citizens travelling to these places need to be quarantined??"
"what?? china !!! do you know china is under new lockdown, engaged in current delta variant spread, even beijing is isolated. it started in nanjing, then spread across. so if india is not going to spread d variant,then china will."

"how to defeat vaxx passports without leaving home. how russian citizens smashed the silly moscow vaccination passports in just 3 weeks.  abstract: this is how mayor sobyanin's vaccine passport was smashed - and it was pretty straightforward.  moscow residents simply stopped going to any business that required a vaccine passport. the most beautiful thing about all this is that the vaccinated showed solidarity with the unvaccinated.  the business was reduced almost to zero in all the establishments in which the vaccination passport was required. muscovites grew their hair out, stopped going to bars and restaurants, didn't go to the movies, stayed in hotels, or did anything that required a vaccination passport. businessmen across the city suddenly called mayor sobyanin's office to scold him for the vaccination passports. they were ruining themselves and they were very angry about it. marina zemskova, director of a regional hotel and restaurant association in russia, said the vaccine passport turned out to be worse for the business than a total shutdown.  at least, if there were another shutdown, she points out, the businesses ""could count on some kind of supportive measures from the government."" with a vaccine passport system there is no government support.  what the not very elitist elites did not foresee about the residents of moscow was that they simply would not participate in the scam at all. the businessmen were so enraged at the mayor that sobyanin made a sudden and surprising announcement on july 19 that it was no longer necessary for anyone to use the vaccine passport.  a hilarious excuse was made, claiming that covid case rates had suddenly improved, as a reason to lift qr code passports. but everyone knew the truth. the muscovites decided that their medical privacy and their right to travel are more important than what the officials told them. it was a massive case of civil disobedience, and they didn't even have to go outside and set things on fire in a big protest. all they did was say, ""any business that wants to see a vaccine passport from me is not going to get any of my money."""

"greatly appreciate what the gov and front line ppl have done so much to help us singaporean!! but one very important point,ppl might not agreed..ppl who are fully vax don't need to do swab test when they attend dinner or concert etc... it doesn't make sense to http://me.by/me.by now we all know that fully vax doesn't meanyouwon't get infected(especially delta variants),most importantly fully vax still can be a virus carrier that we can easily spread to others..correct me if i am wrong.thanks."
i think you already know the answer but want to seek comfort from some official clarification. i think you won't get any.
"be realistic and accept the reality and fact !!!   till the day, mask is not needed for vaccinated then singapore is ready to open fully.  as of now, singapore is no where near that stage.   jumping the gun and expect positive outcome is wishful thinking that is bound to fail !!!!"
seems only economic recovery is a top concern. the 1st top concern must be to unite all fully vaccinated family members. where is the special scheme travel lane of family members? 19 months! still not able to? or need to wait for magic vaccine? fully vaccinated members from any countries must be allowed. how many more months they need to wait?
why got ad ?... this is very important national announcement.

bmpcos sure. think. bring in the covid viruses. see what hub you still want. when all workers and businesses are locked down. infection rate skyrockets and people are either infected or ordered to hibernate at home. maybe you should roam the ghost town then. talking about economy before precious lives. lol.
the singapore pledge can throw away
"blueberry latte  if there is a terrorist attack, will you still come out and try to live normally or will you dig a hole and hide inside worrying about the next terrorist attack?"

blueberry latte  i face the virus but you are scared so you should be the one to dig hole. where else can you hide your precious life?
"​bmpcos nah. i'm enjoying life, no worries. you go back where you come from, dig your hole and bring the virus to face it, since you think you're brave. lol. don't worry. you'll live well with the virus like you said. now, get a life and move on."
"blueberry latte  i come back to singapore in the end because i am born here, raised here, did my national service here, contribute my usefulness here, pay taxes. true blue? i am bluer than you. difference: i don't whine like you"

"just for your understanding. youtube categorised a comment as a spam when there are multiples of it. thereafter the comment doesn't show up in the comment list as its been put into the channel's spam folder. creators will then get to decide if they want to show the comment or ignore it. that is, if the creator of the youtube does the admin work to look through the comment inbox."
discovery walking tours tv but it was gone even when i posted it just once.
the 160 related channels are all wrong. you are right. their mistake. my mum hates the whole village and the whole village hate my mum. and i think my mum is right

you can differentiate whether it's the youtube ai or the channel owner deleting by observing the speed of deletion. cause the ai thing literally sits within the apps itself. can't fight with them but you can try your best to work around it.
demonthatgotlordkeithit happened to me too bro... they only wants you to listen to a single narrative...don't ask questions and to ask is a crime nowadays... this is not a platform for any decent discussion especially on american politics and covid matters....✌️
pilot home isolation.... kind of difficult in singapore.... small homes...
"agree, as we do not live in houses like foreigners country, we live in hdb flats for most of us"
"we do not have so many hospitals. hospitals are also needed for non civid patients like transplant, cancer, stroke, etc  guess we have to share facilities"
we can open..... but will others do the same.
trung nguyen 👄
trung nguyen not now haha. not good to produce babies during a pandemic 😅
did we close borders? look how bad we are such that they have to intrude our privacy by barging into our homes and discrimination by vaccination against the non-vaccinated and making people fight amongst themselves. it's pathetic and laughable whenever they praise themselves.
blueberry latte  the majority of singaporeans beg to differ...you are alone with that few whiners

"economy is mass market, mass market spent all their savings getting thru this 2 year pandemic where got money go travel?"
not every sector is affected
"if you go to the singapore's moh situation report website and read their travel advisory, moh advises ""defer all overseas travel"", contradicts the government's decision to allow vaccinated singaporeans to go on leisure holiday travel overseas, so it might possibly imply that the government expects singaporeans to take their own risk while on overseas holiday travel."
all country except the ones highly infected with new varriants
"india, china and philippines"
when going to ban unvaxx from public transportation. at least be consistent with your half-fucked policy.
hell and heaven also open they borders...expecting more   to come...earlier then actual date...also planing to vaccinate them before enter...god bless the world...

singaporean dn go batam 100k insurance its a joke
shouldn’t the govt think of what if what if : someone is case 0 and super new variant spreader. a dozen of life lost. crippled the health care. etc. the list goes on  the grievances and anger of citizens or innocent people who should be make responsible? should case 0 be liable also to be fair ?  case 0 could be going for his long awaited vacation with money to burn. however the deceased might be sole bread winner or someone loved ones. is it fair ? i know life is never fair but at least you can make it better. i hope you don’t pretend dunno 🤷

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl with malaysia, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
"this is gold!🤪😳🧐🙄🥴food for thought …🤔‘if you are open minded enough to take these words in, have a think about it. this was posted to the nz prime ministers page posted on jacinda ardern's page:by a person named jo wright of all the vaccines i have taken in my life like tetanus shots, measles, mumps, polio, meningitis, tb shots, etc... never have i heard so many lies and deceptions over a vaccine that says i have to wear a mask and socially distance even when fully vaccinated, and that i could still contract or spread the virus even after being fully vaccinated.never had to get tested when i was perfectly healthy without any symptoms whatsoever.never been bribed by the establishments to take the vaccine in order to win a holiday and/or cash prizes or earn frequent flyer points.i never had to worry about cardiac issues, neurological disorders, blood clots and sadly more! didn't even have to worry about death. never was i ever threatened by the use of force by the government, employers, police force, and military for a vaccine as seen overseas.i was never judged by my friends or relatives if i didn't take it. i was never discriminated against for travel or other regular services to a point where i could not buy or sell without it. the vaccines i have listed above never told me i was a bad person for not taking them or for even taking them for that matter. i have never seen a vaccine that threatened the relationship between my family members and/or close friends to a point of destroying my relationships with them ever. never have i seen it used for political gain. never seen a vaccine needing 24/7 mass media advertising and promotion on every media outlet known to man.then there’s mixing and matching different vaccine brands and being told it's okay to do it one day and then told the next day to not do it (overseas).i have never seen a vaccine threaten someone's livelihood, as well as wipe out their jobs.i have never seen a vaccine that allows a 12-year-old child's consent to supersede their parent's consent (that one alone blows me away).finally, after all the vaccines (jab, shots) i listed above, i have never seen a vaccine like this one that discriminates, divides, and judges a society. so much information is censored, deleted, and removed from the internet and mainstream media! so many doctors, health care professionals, police and scientists are censored and forbidden to speak out or ask legitimate questions when what is being allowed or not allowed does not make sense! particularly when it comes from mainstream media. i have never known a vaccine that has made all the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture it exempt from liability if it kills everyone to a point where no life insurance will cover it! this is one powerful vaccine guys! it does all these things above that i have mentioned and yet? it does not do the one thing it is supposed to do which is? fight off this pandemic  🤷🏻‍♀️"
this is absolutely ridiculous. vaccinated residents cannot re-enter but travellers can?!
"local cases are high when compare to the import cases. so it indicates that disease is getting spread, not only just because of people who travel from other country. when people are vaccinated, why can't the singapore government opening their border for other countries. as everyone leaving their family in their home country  and coming to singapore for the job is to survive and due to financial crisis what they have at their home country. because of financial commitment, people are unable to leave their job and coming to their home country. its been one and half years people are struggling to meet their family members. if the people are vaccinated properly, why can't the government bring up some solution for opening the border with all safety measures. having lot of respect and hope on singapore government as always. but it's disappointing and painful that discrimination among countries regarding the border reopening. government has to take some initiative to open the border by implementing some safe travel plan."
i can't find any one man's opinion on this topic on youtube but i can find chinese propaganda?
all it takes is for indonesia to open a low tax haven in batam/ bintan and attract funds and investment. laws can always be enacted to provide the comfort required by investors.
what about india
"very lousy, all step down 👎"
imagine hiring an actual epidemiologist to plan a countermeasure against covid. pffftttt that's clearly not a good idea

actually we can’t even open all doors of our shopping centre. let alone overseas. i understand there is an urgency to restore air travel but it’s just so hard. i believe there is some sabotaging involved.
can i go to malaysia by road? are the borders open?
the so call expert maybe still learning about delta. the problem is they try too hard to convince us they know everything and may sugar coat the information a bit too much. but sabotaging should not be the case. why sabo ourself? who want kene blanket party by doing that?
eric phua i am supporting the government. they are trying their best to restore things to normal. i just suspect someone is sabotaging.
"some how if there was some form of consequences for this level of absurdity, i don’t think they will continue to perform like this way. they seemed un affected with people dying due to their incompetency."
because their irresponsible action is not accountable for.
nothing absurd here. everything done is a considered decision based on what is known. lots of unknown too. instead of throwing stones which doesn't help anyone  time you chip in like the rest and unite behind the team.
big brother choo so to consider this pandemic to be an endemic falls under which category? known or unknown?
big brother choo incompetency is incompetency even if provided with all the knowledge available on covid an idiot will still come up with an idiotic plan.

i think it’s better to give deep thoughts before speaking and make decisions. people are getting furious.
do you know why there is a spike in cases? is it the govt's fault to increase dine in to 5 or is it imported cases? or are we too careless? please read before you fire at the mtf. what do you want? lockdown?
rs lin yes. you just suggested the perfect solution. lockdown is the way to go.
richard w  all f&b will be gone in a lock down. all losing revenues  there are also the people who work on daily wage or the self employed.  the govt will have to take out another $100 billion to support . is this a good thing ?
thank you government and the mtf for the hard work and challenging task. it is everyone's own duty to protect yourself and don't just pinpoint at the government. if you can contribute good suggestions that would be wonderful rather than complaining
"yes the government should not rely on medical expert advise, just get a smart admin service officer not from medical background and look into how india overcome the delta wave in goa and uttar pradesh state by distribution ivermectin medical kit, and why africa being a traditional hotbed of pandemic is relatively unscathed (comparatively to western countries) after 18 months of pandemic."
jonathan s next time you have a serious medical illness. maybe you should consider india for medical holiday.
"michael goh 吴 they solve johnathan  problem immediately,, either he is cure or they dump his  body over the river and he is  never heard again and forgotten,"

"stellene sally yes of course they will solve , whatyouknow abt india power. india is not small country like urs . its like ocean ,u cant  even dream about how they solve the issue in india, handling country like indiayoushould have guts don't just sit in dot like  country n talk abt india . solving issues in small country like singapore is very very easy not india."

i think the glcs are going bust & that's the main reason they open up the economy. you know a lot of ex-pap & ex-ministers are running the glcs & it would be a pity we really allow them to go jobless.
if singapore doesn't open borders soon it will be left behind and cutoff. many countries have already opened and have gone back to business as usual.
yes
exactly
absolutely
yes
right
"lmao all ofyouguys thinking opening border will do good than harm,while the main reason of ""wuhan virus"" is the culprit that spread from one place to another.opening borders will have the potential to mutate into new variant which could be worser than  current now."
total lock down please! just yesterday we had 19 importations and not sure what covid variants they brought into our shore?
it’s just not possible now yet. look at the numbers. infection rate skyrocketed despite vaccination.
"this is not a game of cards. it is your  life and mine. ""ni luo pei kong"" he is not my father!"

home recovery is not advisable. pigeon' hole (apartments:- limitation of space area) spreading virus fast(especially delta virus).
can we do something about people coming into singapore our covid cases high and those people who are coming in to singapore that can have covid can make it more challenging for us!!
this india variant really sucks. this is the problem when cecapore allowed ceca people to enter during those times when india was having trouble containing the india delta variant.
"yes, alreai  cecapore,"
"its not india variant ,youcan call it has china virus . i don't know how canyouppl cal it has  indian variant when china has spread it to whole world"
the people that were voted in are the people that play out its citizens. vote wisely and remember the covid mess always.
basically.. citizen just dont enjoy. just keep working..

no rotig prata 4 me from india.
i m sure he will put singaporean first.
quite true…
"why welcome people in and then restrict the people in the country’s movement? if you want to open, then open all the way. don’t just open for the sake of business and please stop using jobs for singaporeans as an excuse for saying this too many times would only just tell intelligent people that this is not the case.  then again we have many who came from lousy schools in this country who are illiterate according to some ministers. thus, that’s must be how they treat the people who are inutile as they support them."
seal young some people just too little to understand anything. poor thing! must  be from a really lousy school or just waste of education as he is like ali baba with open and close sesame strategy.
jobs for singaporean?  go changi bizs district park and see job for who?
sounds like my grandad after a bottle of jack & coke
there should be no different  treatment to category 4 countries. all vaccinated travellers should be allowed home quarantine if they have clear pre departure and arrival pcr and antigen test.
agreeeee!
keep hating.
michael goh 吴youthink the whole world can rot butyouwill happily with your borders closed??
44iris that’s whyyoushould keep hating!
"michael goh 吴 every one who is vaccinated should be treated the same, irrespective of their race or country.a uniform sop for all the vaccinated travellers coming into singapore.and yes,i will continue to hate discrimination."
44iris why is singapore with such high vaccination rate continues with such high infection rate?
"michael goh 吴 because after high vaccination rate,most of the cases are asymptomatic.people are transmitting the virus unknowingly.if the only thing we look at is the daily case numbers,we will never move forward.this year we have vaccinations along with self test kits.we have become more resilient."
"michael goh 吴 we can't blame one county for a virus or it's variant.we need to take a holistic http://approach.no/approach.no one is safe till everyone is safe.can we actually blame any one county for alpha,beta,delta variants??"
"michael goh 吴 i'm currently quarantined in a hotel with my 2 yr old child.i was vaccinated and i had clear pre departure pcr test. on arrival at changi, i had another pcr and antigen test,both clear. in the past week in quarantine, i had two more antigen tests done, both clear. yet i am locked up. why?? if i had travelled from category 2 country,i could have quarantined at home http://easily.my/easily.my question, why does the country of origin matter in the first place? if an individual is vaccinated with negative pcr and antigen test, they should be treated the same as category 1 travellers."
agreed
"during this time can we reduce the number of foreigne students coming  on gov free education and focus more on singapore students, since we don't have so much extra budget like in the past. singapored $ 1.5 billions for  free foreigne education in the past still sustainable? much too money to spent, maybe can top our ns men cpf for their 2 years ns."
"seal young . yes i think our youth who serve their 2 years ns are well qualify. disappointed that you see any of our singaporean youth to be qualified. anti singaporean again? giving free education to other countries youth make you feel ""got face"" ? rather than helping our own singaporean youth who serving 2 years ns?"
ndpsongs4singapore . you prefer to train foreign students to be ready to displaced singaporean youth who serving their 2 years ns? so you want to tell them they don't have the relevant skill set and ask to be food delivery after their ns? 🇸🇬
"give money for them to study is fine as long locals are covered. if local student does not receive any support and suffering, that is a problem? that is just my personal thoughts."
equilibrium? try staying in a 700 sf house with 5 people? ( instead of a bungalow) no job or making a few ks a month? (instead of a few million a yr) get real.
"please let the tourists know, limited to 2 dine in. no music in restaurants and no alcohol consumption after 10.30pm.  and there is no nightlife entertainment here too."
"why ?? that's part of the excitement of traveling during covid, right ?? lots of unexpected lockdowns 😂😂so exciting"
"please open up border with bangladesh. we worker long time waiting for loving singapore. we suffering with family, please try to understand.thanks"

smallgouphakka being healthy doesnt equate to (your) stup!dity
fred lacroix that's because you are foolish..how do you prove that you're healthy ?  you disagree with mtf decisions because you think you are very healthy. 🤣🤣🤣
smallgouphakka disagree with what? vaccination is only useful for a percentage and priority groups of the population..younger healthy people and children doesnt even need that vax..and you are foolish of assuming otherwise..thats why the society is f*cked up with people thinking like you

urbaniten you must be speaking for yourself. can't be mistaken you're an undischarged patient of woodbridge.
seal youngyou know why they have to open the border? probably many glcs are on the verge of going bust. that's my thinking.
"yeap, when one’s life is cut off, what’s left is the underworld which will always be open!"
i think the glcs are going bust & that's the main reason they open up the economy. you know a lot of ex-pap & ex-ministers are running the glcs & it would be a pity we really allow them to go jobless.
where did you copy this?
"it is not only businessmen whose hq is in singapore and students who need to go overseas for their studies that require your attention and consideration !what about the poor hawkers, coffeeshops, eateries, restaurants and all kinds of businesses (big, medium & small) who equally need to make profits to survive & stay afloat ?just because toa payoh lorong 8 hawker centre has cases of people infected with covid, you authorize their closure with immediate effect (for cleaning & disinfecting) for couple of days. are you aware of the business consequences ? (1)every single stall holder has to throw away or give away their food, as they couldn’t allow their food to be kept for that couple of days unless they are still uncooked & kept in the fridge.(2)business earnings drop tremendously but still need to pay overhead costs. what about profits for their livelihood ? some stall holders still have elderly parents or young children in school ?according to medical science the delta variant is air-borne. unless you can disinfect the whole country at same time, it defeats the purpose of infecting one place today and another place tomorrow but instead causing agony and frustration to each and every singaporean !you are worried the hospitals are overwhelmed because you are unable to provide some form of “self-medication” when a person is tested with covid using the ‘art’ test ! i was told that in china, many are cured by boiling herbs to drink !ivermectin is used by doctors in some parts of the world with covid but in singapore we hear all sorts of reasons that it could not be bought here ?give the public information on chinese herbs, drugs and also western medicine and allow us to make our own decision how to treat ourselves once tested with covid (when we are still well with no symptoms) so that we don’t need to trouble the hospitals as they cannot cope anymore !please adopt an open and consultative method not an authoritative approach !"
god's amazing grace could the vaccine is a weapon for spreading virus?
urbaniten lol… 😂
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bgn2ozaw80&t=0m51s0:51 eat less meat, eat less fried stuffs lol? covid is not as simple as you think... the root source is social interaction... which is impossible to avoid completely."
really shows what kind of people are leading the country today
too bad no doctors in the taskforce. then again i believe doctors dont like to dwell on this political nonsense
all disease boils down to your own health and immunity. you can never go wrong with a healthier lifestyle.
for the social interaction is nothing we can do but its gonna be there fault for having a social interaction doing this period  also stay safe
"hey guys.. don't worry ifyouhave immunity just stay back at ur own house, don't over thinking about the virus, it's not a big deal 😉 in this situation a lot of country yet not get even vaccine they already ready to face the virus and they can beat the virus , even don't have hospital facilities 👍 so pls keep smile , don't go out for unnecessary 🙏"
"how about if your neighbour is using hdb as house temple, 24/7 burning.  when burning stop, he start smoking so you 24/7 taking in pollution.  then....immunity lower?  like what one mp said recently call nea, call police, hdb, town council all called already.  she also said she didnt care that 386 died from secondhand smoke (which is not their fault, they didnt burn) then, these people ""eat less meat, less fried stuff"" got use?"
doctor won't say eat less meat... dr just will say.. everything in moderation
"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23covid_vaccine#covid_vaccine has the structure of hiv same as covid 19 virus to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus(just like overclocking immunity system temporarily), but unable to deceive the new covid 19 variant, the virus will permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to duplicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated.  covid vaccine is a resistance of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like 'murphy', ""against the virus not eliminated"", currently the opportunity to the death of having vaccine injection is less due to it's ineffectiveness since vaccine maker has been modified it to be safe.  vaccine manufacturer can be sued now after fda fully approve those vaccine, this is great liberty status evolution. a lot of people death or having long term adverse reaction in vaccination before, and the government still keep hiding the truth.///1"
public space are not ready setup for endamic. so opening is ok if you let these visitors stay within sia premises to settle biz needs.  if citizen and population cannot be out in our own land. i don't think visitor in thousand should be allow. these thousands is not going to solve sia t 1/2/3/4/5 problems. and they should not be the cause of a new wave. if there is a gap not cover.  if there is reduce ridership - what is the rush to built the new line. if you allow 5 hdb projects to mis-manage. give the jobs to local contractors. i'm sure many needs jobs now and can be train for the job.
"mr gan kim yong, you saved communication, makes a lot of sense,  thank you"

welcome delta plus
"some are new singaporean,,, but if we r hit badly,youwill see them packing n leaving ,"
"hopefully the one case imported is not the new variance ""mu""."
why must make ur own singaporean quarantine and stay home butyoukeep open border and let tourist come in without quarantine.because singaporean good to bully huh.stop roti prata la make all kinds of grandma grandfather story which they hear also laugh
it's because unlike other countries we can't vote out our government and ministers when they are not doing their jobs properly.
at least tourist got some benefit if they spend here. but what about foreigne students given free university education while our youth serve ns. waste money and take up opportunities that could be given to singaporean students. we give them free education while they might bring more delta in.
never ever change <b>pandemic</b> framework to endemic idealogy unless & for sure we are ready to sacrifice lives..
yep ready
who is sacrificing lives?  do you want to be lock up forever?
even countries like malaysia who suffered so many casualties are now planning to open up this is the reality of life.
rs lin how far toa payoh to orchard? how far johore to kuala lumpur? dun compare we are goin to the moon. 1939 😷
вιℓααℓ_вℓαcк∂υsт  how far is the brain to the mouth?
rs lin ask mtf 🤐
вιℓααℓ_вℓαcк∂υsт  i think the kl guy should have some idea
when thing get worst you come out with more worst same talking again.
"i agree with the governments idea of equilibrium. we can always compromise and half lockdown half open up. so if a person is asked for 1 week quarantine, we quarantine him during hours where there are most people from morning to mid afternoon, then allow him to go out later evening and night. its good for the economy and also can prevent spread."
doyoueven know ifyour at all making any sense?
lol sorry 😆 i meant quarantined people should be allowed to go out morning to afternoon where productive work is most needed and quarantine only at night since they need to rest anyway.
agree💯
"avistar avistar, tt contradicts the very core objective of a quarantine."
"how did he become a minister.  comparing apples to oranges. eating more fruits for better health makes sense. continuing relaxing border controls with countries with elevated levels of virus infection is not going to be good for the country's health and by extension, consumer confidence. and wait till domestic consumption data takes a hit from elevated virus cases in a one of the most kiasi countries in the world."
"seal young i see you everywhere. seriously, how much you get per post? china troll gets $0.50 per post. maybe they had their pay raise. how to apply for this job?"
here we go again...
"uk and us are least concerned of the covid-19 now. just follow what they're doing and to enjoy our lives and freedoms. mild covid won't hurt or kill. these is what pfizer is for. the more this bunch talk of guidelines, the more fear it creates."
welcome ministers. 你們辛苦了！🙏🙏
please open the india to singapore travel✈️️
bro kab open huga yar plzz btou na
"is alway open,one way ticket,. goodbye , thank you for leaving ."
what bro not open
oyk you gambled and lost
"he doesnt feel a pinch becos he is not a casulty. the worse scenerio he get, is to head a corporation in temasek or gic. nothing to lose. gaurantee return. maybe is what he hope for."
clap for lord of the ring speech😂
please trust and support our government
you should know that statistics is never accurate!
"ofc its not,stats is a percentage of what they calculate even so its inaccurate,what about the official number of cases that aren't in the stats.."
the current statistics is not accurate as most population are still in partial lockin mode and the infection is not control.  people cannot be in partial lock-in mode. than you can see the real pattern.
"you need to look from the perspective of the gov, then you understand why the statistics is not accurate."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bgn2ozaw80&t=0m51s0:51 eat less meat? is protein not an essential nutrition anymore?
"i think he meant tcm (traditional chinese medicine) methodology... patient needs to eat something light (like vegitable soup, porridge) in order to recover from illness"
"qian xu don't think he ever mentioned tcm. besides, lets not have tcm be a consideration and maintain our actions on scientific bases."
today saw parents allow their childrens to mask-down at ntuc consuming ice-cream while shopping in-between the various shopping corridor.  all public space should have designated eating and drinking area.  all hawkers centers should have transparents barriers board and everyone sit individually finish eating and leave.  all public toilet should be heat treated at least twice a-day.
"yes, the public toilet is where  most ppl with blow their nose shite n waah their mouth, most who eat out will use their toilet"
"aren't tired of being so paranoid for so long? we can die of many other illnesses too, not just covid.  live and let live"
don’t expect 100% cooperation.
time to give out money..hehehe..thats the easy way out
herd immunity strategy
herd immunity won't happen 82% vaccination n we have clusters all over the island n even in pfizer ap 1.5k daily cases how wonderful
"sir, your on the ground infrastructure is still not ready for endamics.  the new eqalibrence reach - when  you know how to contain the delta    virus when all singaporean / citizen and migrant workers can be out in our own space first with day to day activities can be conducted with 24/7 mask-on as law as long as people are outdoor or with one other person."
"simply, these 3 ministers represent the 3 blind mice. they are lost at sea & they lost their compass. they don't have decisive leadership like china, nz, taiwan & hk. they rather choose the proven disastrous path undertaken by us, uk & israel. bear in mind, singapore is not as stable as these countries & singapore can't afford to copy them blindly. lky has always alluded singapore to an artificial nation."
"lol singapore is the top asian country in ranking in terms of covid resilience and is higher then all the countries you mentioned here, but ageing singaporeans like to always complain govt even if facts say we are a global leader..."
"prawnee in an open ending pandemic, gdp & past glories mean nothing for singapore. there has been many great nations in history which have disappeared into oblivion. in a long term pandemic, singapore neighbours have better chance of surviving.  singaporeans complain about their leadership because these ministers are merely administrators of the nation & are no leaders. they don't have the qualities of 1st generation leadership such as courage, creativity, foresight, industriousness, wisdom & self-reliance."
"charles goh i'm not talking about past glories i'm talking about current ranking about covid. google best country handling covid, or best covid economy ect. and singapore and scandinavian countries consistently tops the list for transparency and endemic planning. so the whole world is praising singapore except a vocal minority of older singaporeans."
"prawnee top countries in handling covid are nz, china, hk & taiwan. open your blind eyes to statistics & not fake news. us, uk & israel are the worst & they want the world to follow them down the path of the dead. you're truly blind because you read too much & trust fake news. there is no cure for stupidity of your kind."
"prawnee do you know the difference between administrators & leaders? leaders are thinkers & administrators don't ever need to use their brain. singapore ministers are merely administrators & who never need to use their brains. these ministers were parachuted from the army & never had to stake out for a living. probably, you had never use your brain too, judging from your mentality."
3 blind mice but highest paid mice in the world
not true. they are trying singapore to be endemic. clearly it did not went as well as predicted. they never dare to do this before vaccination reach a certain percentage.
"oyc you are talking cock; virus and human co exists, are you god. you are a backdoor shove in minister"
"there's no proven path and it's a tough journey that our leaders trying to find a way out for singapore to survive.... despite all the effort, it's sad to see the cynical comments here, jeering and mocking...."
no proven path??? canyousee how uk and us already open up.. their vaccination rate is still below ours.. im starting to doubt these mtf to be able to handle this...
ali irhami what was the death rate in us and uk ? are you saying singapore should go down the same path to let so many die ?
"smallgouphakka then why the mtf always sounding about “covid-resilient-nation”, “endemic”. etc. they always echoing this before the mass vaccination campaign around mid year.. that after we reaching 80 percen vaccination, we can start to opening up.. in reality they are not preparing this. they should walk the talk!"
seal young i agree opening up is need to do it step by step.. but this feels like you do 1 step ahead and then 3 step backwards... they announce that we are going to face endemic situation a long time ago.. they should prepare the scenario like this and not make the backward step..
and i dont know why some people think the mtf are bulletproof for criticism.. they are the highest paid leaders in the world.. and with how they handle the situation now it seems they are looks overpaid.
"seal young of course less casualties, but with what happens now, it feels like the mtf dont prepare this scenario before.. they have time to plan this before.. they should preparing all the healthcare system to get ready for the endemic situation.. i dont see that now"
ali irhami  covid-resilient-nation ? who has ever said that ?
unvaccinated and not-infected are not the one spreading the virus. it's those vaccinated/breakthru and asyptomatics - which are spreading the stronger mutated virus. opening allowing a few thousands visitors is not going to fixed sia t1/2/3/4/5 situations  all foreigner should not step outside sia ground. and complete all their business dealing within the airport allocated business office / hotel.  no more long term and short term pass should be allow. until this wave can come under control and let the singaporean/citizen and all on the ground proof test all the new setup.
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha kekw
haha meat is okay bro. go for organic grass fed beef and pasteurised kampong chicken.
global minimum tax for mncs + locking out the world.  singapore viable hub?
seal young who cares about happy or sad?
understandable 👌
"gov flipping roti prata.cannot sell singapore anymore ,vaccinated elderly are the one to pay the price.stop boasting 2 dose are fully http://vaccinated.now/vaccinated.now 3 doses are than considered fully vaccinated."
he's so full of unnecessary and irrelevant analogies it's annoying to watch 🙄 just get to the point.
that is how they confused most of the people
can't convince the citizens.  confuse them
it was cringy
i'm totally disingaporeusted 🤮🤮🤮
the analogy does not explain the equilibrium  that he kept on stressing...
when you can’t convince. you confuse
he needed to explain to the illiterates so that they can understand better.
識時務者 how to be convinced when people are illiterate and came from lousy schools? you are much better?
"angeline swee illiterate? was there anything to read in the video? besides, his analogies often do not properly explain the original statements made."
sharon chen does illiterate only mean can’t read? now i begin to see what how the minister thinks. i guess too many of them in the country to make our elites think so as i can see an example here!
"seal young arn’t losers the ones who liked to be called sia shuey, illiterate and come from lousy schools. i guess too many of them coming out to call out others without looking at themselves in the mirror? well, that’s why they don’t mind infected and better still their children to be infected! even they don’t have children, they are people who are so selfish that they don’t even think of their own parents. now we can see the kind of losers we have!"
seal young false accusation is at its finest. a pity that till date people just don’t even know much about karma and almighty as they continue to live with their malice. no wonder things are the way they are because we have too many bad spirits around!
seal young guess who will be willing to have their parents dead with the virus going! that’s why open without contingency plan is once again at its finest!
"angeline swee illiterate means unable to read or write. please look it up before posting sweeping assumptions of people here. perhaps you could also consider that part of helping people to understand better is by getting to the point quickly before he loses the audience's attention. i feel bad for him actually, he looks like a nice guy, but every time he starts explaining something, it makes him look like he doesn't know what to say or do. this is not enough for a leader and minister. on the other hand, you can see that lw and maybe km have improved since the a year ago in the task force. i stand firmly on the side that the govt should not rush to loosen measures before ensuring they are prepared, because we don't want to be like us or uk (but very fast becoming so). that's for a whole other argument. my comments from the start of this thread have always been about how he said something and not what he said."
"sharon chen with that i agreed with you that this government never seems to learn from the past and their risk approach they have been taking often get out of hand and then they start doing something. there don’t seems to be contingency plan in place as they are cock sure of themselves and everyone around them will nod their hands like those big head dolls. that’s why lives to them are just numbers and they are so out of touch with the people as they are holed up in their own ivory tower. unfortunately, we don’t have too many smart people who don’t know better."
seal young it is most unfortunate that many people who think they are smart don’t know that they are otherwise. xenophobic and racism have always been used by politicians for their own agendas. only the super smart will see through that. just so unfortunate that we have too many people who pretend to be smart!
"seal young go to the ground to find out more before you regurgitate what you have been told. we are able to survive because of the hard work of our forefather who sacrificed for this country and stop thinking that we we were a fishing by village before the pap told over. also, it is the people in this country who gave up their rights to bring this country what it is today. talents, investors? they all left when they made the money to enjoy their twilight years while the people of this land continue to toil. wake up to the reality of the world today and you will know why your age group are dropping off like flies. you’ll know that what goes around comes around and debts will always needed to be paid up when one trade with the devil. besides, how many people have their ancestors buried here to know that they are no longer a migrant. go tell the americans , australians and canadian that they had been a migrant as well!"
"seal young everything is according to what you see isn’t it? people just need to know that every action there is a reaction. everything is written on the wall and people are still asking why. when one takes a risk, whether one wins or loses will depend on divine intervention. haven’t you learn that in history?"
i love this carnival. quite entertaining. the clowns are also good in cooking prata.
same http://tune.no/tune.no life in the statement.  tired?
"awesome comment. it is hilarious. frivolous comments from the netizens too...the many self-appointed health experts n visionaries of economy n national progress. let's chill over some chai n prata, m.  lolz."
", as we know, delta variants is very contagious, ,,  after allowing  so many  delta variant in ,  is naturally everyone will be good at cooking prata ."
stellene sally  nz and china also have delta  did they allow them in? be less xenophobic
"a bit like this? don't just go gym. life is short. eat healthy but don't just restrict your diet to steam chicken breast with no salt, pepper and skin. some families say they miss fried chicken and mala hotpot. six packs? our body needs an equilibrium of muscles and fats."
lol
please open the border for all countries  but vaccine should be mandatory . atleast those are working here should be allowed with strict quarantine rule
"working from shall be mandatory. do not say vague word ‘ default’, it’s useless. some company pretending essential services asking employees to go office exposing themselves into risk. employees are also mingling here and there, high chance of spreading virus if anyone infected."
"they say default because not everyone can work from home mah like those in security, banks and it."
we should hire malaysia minister of health they seems to be doing a great job
hope dope mistake happens but that doesn't mean they are not doing a good job.
malaysia??? great job???? lolololol
by malaysia trajectory they should be zero case in 13 days 😂
seal young because singaporeans are working for me
true. cheaper also. plus they know how to seek funding themselves. you know what i mean?
yes pls open borders … need a real break and improve mental health or at least reduce q.o cos lengthy q.o  harm mental health
plzz open border
"maan alikhan . didn't the visitors from germany just fly in? what you talking about, fly to germany if you want also, nobody preveting you from going."
maan alikhan desperate to go home? pls go and don't come back. 🤣
funny. he is teaching people how to be healthy.  this will be very frustrating.
"he's not teaching us to be healthy, you dont understand? lol"
more like amusing. these rants r hallmarks of pitching to the citizens...but with a large dose of adulated knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease.  wanting to bring competitive edge to the economy requires careful n calculated measures n should never be at the cost of safety.
gave up listening to the taskforce orady.   last yr's talks still makes sense. this year's recent press conferences talk are getting on my nerves. esp when numbers keep gg up. would rather just follow the rules. simpler this way.
"shorten work hours for shipyard and construction worker who work 12 hours a day, , then theywill have enough rest n better immune system"
"pls family friends country safe is much more important than everything at this moments, much more important than economic.  i wanna everyone safe!"
hope dope agree
agree.  who wants family members to become some statistics data? take care everyone.  pray ifyoucan.
travel lane not meant for all. not all humans are same. not nice to hear but it is the truth. actually you are talking about it also. health. natural selection. and why certain people. bopian one.
"one thing is clear: pm lee, oyk and lawrence are poor communicators. they have successfully confused singaporeans. the government message we are getting now: help yourself if you get covid; don't expect the government to help."
nwo agenda confused?? go yt and watch lhl nwo speeches
you are just  naysayers.nothing good come out of your mouths
"forever, come up with law & regulation. but interpretation is up to each person' devices."
i thought they are multilingual.
are they from raffles?
you are a poor listener.
can you for once encourage our people to pray and seek god for mercy...????
human beings and virus can co-exist?  talk cock! we need to vanquish the virus.
"thank god opening borders are still on the agenda, covid 19 cannot cost singapore airlines or changi airport more!!! let’s fight through this pandemic and hopefully singapore aviation will thrive again!"
you cam up lorry if you like travel
like how swiss standard of living is forever on agenda.
asd certain things just don't happen
some things and luxuries do not last forever.
can i go to malaysia by road? are the borders open?
"mr gan are you from some ""elite"" school , seems you cant even speak properly"

blah blah blah…. noise
share with you how to stay at home diy houttuynia cordata (lizard tail) cream to fight covid-19 we should give it a try to explore every avenue aim to slow down the increasing exponential wave of transmission.
when they discovered that vaccine companies lied.. its too late
"piak piak roti prata , earlier said   live with covid ,now restriction .what rubbish"
be adaptable
👌
"sir i don't know why are you still ban the higher risk country peoples to enter in to singapore...  from your point, in singapore fully vaccinated can go for meeting, hotel, hospital, temples where ever them likes... but fully vaccinated indians can't enter in to singapore 🙄🙄what is the meaning may j know is there any politics going on singapore with singapore,...?.. there are so many of them waiting more then 2years with out job... 🙏🙏🙏pls concern theirs and atleast allowed some of them🙏"
"i'm not indian, and i agree with you. such  border restrictions are due to be lifted. some people on youtube are xenophobic, ignore them."
just shut up and stay home in india.... we have kids and parents that cant be vacinated and their lives is on stake and here you are talking about politics...what a idiot!
"su su kindly sorry for this reply su su.. bloody fool nobody will stopyoudon't get vaccine, and your parents,. and ur kids, 🙄 why doyoucome out with your kids under 12? any reasonable take more sensitive adoption.. and we r foreigners won't enter without vaccine and shn.. we are ready to face whatever your restrictions 🙄..  it's a small suggestion,. don't get it personally 👍 keep quite and stay safe ... youtube also spread covid 19😁😁"
manikandan gandhi mr manikandan this is not the way to respond to susu. why are you so angry susu also have no right to say what he or she said. you will be happier in india ask your dormitory workers in singapore
"vrajes1 yup brother.. that's really correct.., but we never came there for enjoyments,. family situation and  scared when think about future,.. else in my opinion i never thought to back to singapore... su su said some reasonable points, that's really correct, but 🙄 i can't understand still singapore won't stop vtl if she/he really an educated then why never comment against singapore ministry?... so the racism is key point here we think seriously 🙄 i'm disappointed anyhow the reply from the su su .. that's why i get much more eager..."
high risk countries are banned because.... they are high risk countries. isnt that obvious.
manikandan gandhi although fully vaccinated but still can get infected. unless your country situation is stable with less cases then maybe singapore may allow entrance. stay safe.
haiden din ❤️❤️ thanks again bro..
"jin so the meaning as well as 🙏🙏 brother i know the reason what they mentioned... as per your understanding about the real situation is low risk country can enter singapore because they are low risk .. try think about what is the meaning of vaccination travel lane? 🙄  if the low risk country can enter with rt pcr test with vaccine certificate, also consider for high risky countries can use the same methods , we can go to shn 21days even this government never think about us 😭😭😭"
manikandan gandhi why should singapore govt think about u? areyousprean or singapore is part of india?yousound like singapore owe youa living!!!
"i am appalled by your lack of basic communication skill. with the supposed level of education provided here, you are clearly an outlier. you clearly sound like somebody who has never been at the receiving end of xenophobia n racism, hence the lack of tact n humanity. a disingaporerace to the many well-mannered singaporeans i encountered."
"venus465 good question... i didn't order them to easing the border for indians.. theres i mentioned very humbly,. please try to understand that, i'm not an singaporean, india not a part of singapore but we r indians depending singapore a long from the innovation of singapore till date.. please be calm sir, covid don't know who's singaporean and who's indian, everyone same from the view of virus,..no more sounds when the virus attack.. ifyouthinkyour the only greatest in the world 🤣🤣🤣 funny 😜😁 i never thought, just ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️keep love others will supportyouand ur love will support others sir🙏❤️"

"yaar deep definitely bro.. we must fight with covid 19 virus untill get an medicine alternative thought i just wanna share the future plan of everyone wants depends country...  i love singapore, why there is the future please try to understand authorities 🙏❤️❤️❤️"
"don't mistaken well mannered as pushover, why should singapore allow foreigners from high risks countries to come in? even australia, such a big country closed their border not even their own citizens are allowed in. singapore govt priority is to protect their own citizens, get your govt to open the border to welcome them ifyouare sincere and stop writing trash here likeyoudo care!!!"
"venus465 sir may i know are really ok ? or mentally challenged like or what?... australian never come for shipyard blaster painter job.. we r indians and bangladeshi only doing that kind of jobs.. just remember the past, if we didn't 🙄🙄 youmay don't know as well as... but every singapore owners can understand what we done ✅ why we need ther.. wait and see... and i'm not saying i need to came there, here a lot of families waiting for their family members (indian workers)... they have children's,... why they still there continue? because if they return then sure jobless... here shipyard category workers can't survive, they don't know any other jobs, from 18 they work with singapore as shipyard category... so pls trh to understand what i'm try to saying 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
venus465youcan bla bla bla bla.. but can't work as a general worker in there... so keep quite sir.. don't make any issues please ❤️❤️❤️
"manikandan gandhi since when did i mention that sprean are the greatest? asyoumentioned that singapore govt should consider your situation before closing the border to india, first and foremost the govt duty is to protect their citizens this is the reason why they're elected for. as for your livelihood,youshould look for your own govt for an answers."
"venus465 omg.... ryoumad? or what?.... i didn't talk about only my situation and financial problem.. there have some of few other indians getting worsen struggle by the ruling of singapore border 🙄🙄 i told about that, if they wish to tender their resignation singapore will suffer but can replace immediately by others.. but the individual can't felt ❤️for example i came india 2020october, i have offer there, but i can't enter in to singapore, already 11months i lost my salary, but i can survive here,.. but those who are there still working their family members still wanna be them to back, almost 2year they can't met them😭😭 that's why we r requesting please try understand mr. soda green... i know you can't 😅😅 but don't hurt others..."

"pardeep chahal i dont hv problems with anyone.... im just thinking for my kids n old parents who cannot take the vacination. their safety over rides everything...toyouur studies more important n to me my family. we already hv too many cases,we cannot afford to hv more"

"su su well ,. but we never said anything wrong, whatever the border measure relaxation and rules we should follow up.. once we r onboard then under control by the singapore govt.. if they can't just ban totally, who ever essential from india can go , pilot program supports some of cmp sectors, we r also fully vaccinated just consider the exact problem?..  and also we never said we need without quarantine entry approvals🙄 and we don't directly came in to ur house too..youdon't get still just keep silent.."

equilibrium with sacrificing lifes?
well you care about some other bloke dying? you really do care? swear on your life?
merlin you must be a lonely person
"anna pu im perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
why don’t they bother to get vaccinated in the first place?
where are the travel bubbles?
fully vaccinated person in the philippines is included?
dey when singapore open to india
"people that think that vaccine won't be mandatory is in denial.  pretty soon the vaccine will needed for everything. (work,travel,restaurants, concerts etc) coming to a country near you."
fuddu
stop it's a virus that has been around for ever.vaccinate and live with it.
"the usa 130,000: it's not a problem at all. but india 40,000: oh no,youcan not enter."
"i'd rather trust the 130,000 from the us than the supposedly 40,000 from india"
qaktus hence proved.
salar po sala
politics or public health?
dumb n dumber measures
is singapore open for indian
please open batam border ..
"relax,smile pls.🤔"
"before opening up to even more people from abroad, why not ensure that everyone already in singapore is able to get a vaccine first? when can short-term pass visitors here due to the pandemic get vaccinated? singapore is relaxing restrictions starting tomorrow, yet no announcement made how we can also be safe. if i ask for a vaccination, i currrently get rejected. i would gladly pay for my vaccine."

"hamid jamie wow i'm shock someone mentioned and recommended expert mrs bella, i thought people don't know her.... she is really good and awesome!"
"neil mccory mrs bella obviously the best broker, i invested $4,500 with her and she made me profit $48,100 in 2 weeks and 3 days. it. was mind blowing."
i'm also a beneficiary as well. trade expert bella changed my 1.2btc to 8.6btc... her trading methodology proves her expertise.
"due to recent volatility in crypto value, i had some loss which depreciated my doge coins xrp because i was holding."

why do i have a nagging suspicion that opening now is not such a good idea...

thank you very much
"sure, what you gonna do as the ceca lane ll be undoubtedly ""fully vaccinated "" as per your requirements - whc comes with fake certs, as widely expected. what kind of detection & verification regime wld you put in place? judging from your incompetence to rein in fake educational certs after years of dealing with em, it isnt cynical to doubt your ability from the word, ""go"". prove it to singaporeans you can manage ceca & its massive racism against the local pmet well before we can trust you do something right about the life & death of sporeans."
"niko lodeon ok, pap ib."
no action talk only
let indonesia come to singapore
"thousands, from the land of variant d, waiting  to come  with their family baggage, with fake degrees  and now with fake vaccination certificates. hopefully we won't reach a stage, where we will have to resort to throwing dead bodies into singapore river."
warped logic
is china safe????? how about our neighbour malaysia?? is this fair??
"mentioned many times cant afford to offend china india indonesia details not impt.""glad"" open borders with open arms after 19 aug suggest no need screening just crossover since we are so confident."
"with plans to open travel lanes for selected countries, how many infections and deaths are acceptable?"
i think 200 per day was mentioned. now they said they have 1000 icu beds.
this is going no where.  open close open close repeat. just move on already. even after year+ n with vaccine. seems like still at square 1.
we have 10% kids not vaccinated yet! there’s news that approval for vaccination for age 1-11 will come end sept and nov.
my mistake…ditsy girl no wonder such foolish thoughts 💭
shiela tee foolish in what sense? foolish for vaccinating kids or the news of vaccination itself is foolish? can you be clear?
ditsy girl  not our kids…leave them alone.  anything below 16 is deem unsafe for vaccination. just keep imported cases at bay n make sure that anyone travelling into singapore serve at least 7 days quarantine n a pcr test that will come back in 3 before they move around the country irregardless of vaccination status. we cannot be too careful.  we already jeopardise the lives of our elderly.  clusters after clusters…for the sake of foreigners n their business effecting our own domestic economy. the current drugs be it pfizer moderna or sinovac…n many more out there are not vaccines. we took it for granted that 2 dosages of anywhere big pharma are paddling like a snake 🐍 oil seller…is the magic pill for the ones in office incompetence.
only child abuser might think of such things!
yawnz!
hi sir please allow fully-vaccinated us people to enter into singapore without shn please thank you ! and a travel bubble with australia too!
vaccinated infected person shows low viral loads? this is different from recent reports from recent youtube reports from many countries.
what do you mean recent youtube reports?
"there will always be low iq people out there who believe in anything they see in youtube, tik tok, grp chat instead of peered review medical papers."
"it's not time to open any sooner !!! face the consequences of this decision, worse is yet to come."
trash force talking trash 🗑 again
"covid 19 is here to stay so we need some sensibility. opening and closing will destroy our economy , any moron minister can do it. ong ye kung will make a good pm."
<b>agree with oyk we must open our borders for economy purposs and also need migrant workers to expedite work progress for all building projects</b>
<b>dont make travel bubble burst again ok</b>
$_$ overrides logical thinking and sense.
don't know what kind of new virus or variants they will bring in ?
it's fair and justified that the vaccinated get the privilege for more freedom of movement and entry to certain establishment.
"yes, if you refuse to get vaccinated like everybody else, and do not do your part to help control the infections where you may be seriously ill, hospitalized and even death to yourself or your family and your country man, you should just sit and home and do not get any privilege to go any places.   why should the vaccinated people be punish with your ignorant and selfish act."
no more bubbles?? now changed to lanes??
foolish exchanges !! get vexed and receive all these cravings
travel bubble step by step bursting.
vaccine doesn't mean no infections. people still can be carrier even they are vaccinated
and they can still be critically ill.
then closed the economy forever?
"so the economy will be close for how long ?? don'tyouthink that the situation will remain like this if they didn't open up , it will be phase 2 phase 3 phase 2 phase 3 ...for ever"
what are the selected country aligible to travel singapore with out quarantine?
"may i ask what and why is this minister of health (who is not medically trained) announcing about allowing work-pass holders and their dependents from higher risk countries to enter singapore?  hasn’t he himself told singaporeans that there are only 1000 beds available for the critically ill in our hospitals? why are we opening the border at this juncture (when singapore is still having many cases, linked and unlinked) while so many other countries are seeing surging infections from the delta variant and higher risk country like india is warning of yet another third wave coming?  aren’t the minister of health and the ministerial task force too complacent and too foolhardy again, to ignore all these disturbing signs that the dangerous variants will hit us adversely, once again?  why are they in such a hurry?"
and the black fungus covid from india.
because money.
useless gov
"anon nymouz if you think the singapore government is useless, please pack your bag and moved to other countries, maybe some african countries where they are only 5% vaccinated and will give anything to get the vaccinations.  singapore seems to be doing a good job in controlling and getting most of the citizens vaccinated at this time by comparison to many many other countries.  well, basically you are the useless one, just know how to make uneducated comment."
phair liu why such hatred against india?
do not take it too lightly as situation worldwide is getting worse despite full vaccination.
saurabh golam not hatred just pure fear. you know how terrifying the black fungus disease are.
"phair liu i understand your sentiment. but the delta variant can come any country, not only india. it is a bit saddening to see why all countries are labelling india; as the culprit / originator for this, causing building animosity against indians. hope you understand our sentiments 😊"
"saurabh golam it's the deadly black fungus infections that i feared the most not exactly delta. didn't meant to hurt the feelings of indians. i just want to remind our gov not to open our borders to any countries so soon, we must seat back and observe whether the vaccines are effective against the new variants or not. this is not the correct timing to open up."
"after some time, it will have to close again. just like israel."
"unless you keep up with the vax-passport, 3rd and 4th booster shots are now mandatory in israel."
israel got ben and jerry or not ?
ethan eros dont dream of any traveling plan the best you can experience is ubin.
every 2 months open and close virus would take at least 100 years to disappear
we hope not
😂😂😂 i hate to say ~ we told you so 😂😂😂 china his favourite bubblegum nation is in total chaos right now. the arrogance ignorance of this man alone will make what you just commented come true.
step by step to relax the social rules can maintain high levels of public health and security of country.
bad decision. too soon.
it is guided democracy. same for the international airline industries which will require all to be vaccinated in order to fly again
it's painful listening to lawrence wong read mandarin. we know he can't speak mandarin with any level of comfort. please leave it to ong ye kung when it comes to mandarin.
that's is why i told my children that their children have to be fluent in both english and chinese as these will be the working languages of the world by the time they start working. i notice some grandparents with limited ability in english language speaking to their grandchildren in rotten english. it is better for the grandchildren to be spoken to in mandarin. i make sure my grandchildren are fluent in both. my 3 children are already fluent in both.
the taskforce should all step down. totally useless
i agree
useless shameless incompetent.......
believe mi the unvaccine will destroy their plan. die die dont vaccine
if indians could fake degrees and get high paying civil service jobs...  how difficult to falsify vaccine certification?
still refuse to learn
"vaccinated people are super carriers, the virus lay dormant and undetectable.  however, should the host got sick from other ailments, a compromise immune system happens and covid reactivates to multiply."
vaccine is the real danger!!
"i just cant believe the amount of mis-spellings in the sub-titles; i.e., orca centres, tribal corridors🤣🤣🤣"
those are auto-generated by youtube so...
sl i've learned that youtube captions are a great indicator of the strength of one's diction. some of the worst yt captions are generated by singaporean accents lol
ktv
bla bla bla  until lambda variant arrives in singapore.
india cannot be trusted! do not accept any health documentation from these jokers! they have fake qualifications and fake employment history thus fake experience !
still haven't learned
"what timing now, everywhere got virus you still want us all go get it and bring back?"
i hope including philippines
"4 common good, kindly try virgin coconut oil against delta variant..."
what happen to oyk bubble bubble travel bubble!
"singapore government has done a great job in managing this pandemic. no country can survive with their border and economy shut down for longer than necessary. push the vaccination rate as high as possible to keep the hospitalization and deaths down to a manageable level, then open up. uk took that gamble. bravo to singapore leaders for their great leadership."
the jabbed catch and spread the virus just the same fyi
yes continue wearing mask. 👍
"no thanks!  with so many unlinked / untraceable cases daily, no one is risking their lives to go to singapore."
"scary cat, go play in the cave!!!"

"except those from malaysia, indonesia, india, brazil..."

didnt they make enough money with the vaccines already?
what about india
"those alexandxx, shentxx, rafflxx huat big big getting the vaccination contracts from moh"
we pharma hub mah so must supoort industry nothing else matters
carol catherine iron bowl
actually they are paying licensing fee up to a couple of millions to administer the vaccine 💉  it is a double edged sword!
shiela tee don’t worry. the prices are inflated to cover the licensing fee. but common folks won’t know the actual number until politicians ask about it in parliament.
jrukawa11  yeap…inflated cost is to cover the licensing plus any other cost. something that takes a dollar to manufacture will cost consumers 200-300. why do you think all the ones in office busy investing in pfizer… for humanity 😂😂😂 that went out the window just like their descorn measuring tools a long long long time ago 🤪
how about differentiating smokers and non smokers?
how about differentiating durian sellers and durian eaters ?
yeah damn those smokers using up all our icus...
ck l as reported around the world actually the unvaccinated are hoarding the lots there so be ensured to be full vaccinated and its time now to mandate full vaccination.
so discriminating
great
indian worker k liye
wanna bow to to ceca again? ceca lots of fake vaccination certs.
singapore needs to open its borders if you can’t see that you are a fool!
well done
"bullshit.  both vaccinated and unvaccinated carry an equal about of virus.  the director of cdc and fauci have said as much.    so this is pure discrimination against the unvaccinated for not doing as they are told by the government.  if the government want to say it is for the protection of the unvaccinated, firstly that is none of your business what risk people take, and secondly, why allow smoking, alcohol, driving, and anything that poses a danger?  so you want to make money from people putting themselves at risk by taxing cigarettes, alcohol, etc, and also fining peoples for putting themselves at risk for not vaccinating?   this is typical china-style authoritarianism.  if you want to do that,  go to china. laws have to be based on reason.  this is logically unreasonable.  so what?  you are going to fine and imprison people for not complying with rules meant to protect them?  you going to fine and imprison people for smoking too much?  having too much sugar or salt?  or drinking too much coke?   don't talk through your arse."
trat prat
good luck with this.
it would be good to have ministers who are qualified in the field of medicine to head the task force than one who have to rely on notes from other medical doctors to read the notes
common sense is more important than a medical doctor that go by the book just to play safe and protect himself.
ong ye koon made a good pm.
"shn or qo is necessary as some develope the illness during the shn/qo period, pls do not compromise human life, for money sake. any tourist coming in, have to pay for their qo and serve their qo .... before allow to roam the land"

"lol, if many donkeys years peoples may believed but now 2021 not 1980 ..money, can buy everything. in this world the most scared was human .."
"haha finally i saw the real purpose. thanks for creating all the smoke screen, again."
👍
"the ktv,dormitory, fish market fiesta are just drama for the end result,vaccine profits!"
97.5 pct of cases have zero or mild symptoms ... quite a bold statement and begs the question has closing the world really been worth it...
the great reset is the real reason.
vaccinated also can harbour covid
they are the super spreaders
they are the carriers
vaccine not working well in word
harmless in 99%

nothing but india 🇮🇳
"india and china la,youso bluryouneed to ask tis question"
how come the authorities can force people to vaccinate
singapore definition of democracy ?
here so fortunate other countries this type of announcement will result in mass protests and riots.
that's because you need permission to protest here 🙄
ms100 hmm and we dont want or need anything like that to happen here. 😏
"l r. of course you wouldn't, missed the point as usual 😑"
eveyone scared of section 55 lah
false documentation of vaccination will be caned and jailed
"cane not enough bro. looking at how many people in the community that may get killed in this and the economic impact, i think must be by death punishment and/or caning in public"
oh plzzzz... so many indians  with fake cert came in absolutely nothing happen to them
but false cert from ceca will just be send back home.
vaccinated now is the privileged
nope. the rich are still the privileged.
i think all they want is money
ahhh now we can know who is fully vac and who is not when going to batam.

"whenever you make such decisions, please lah have your team think of how people will try to find loopholes and exploit such measures and take them into account.there will always be some who will try to do this."
you assuming they are thinking 😅 that is the beginning of all this mess.  if only their brain 🧠 is an app. they will use it more often. they are soooo into apps n technology but lack the skill n upgrade knowledge to do their jobs. when you have a taskforce who handle a health crisis like their own personal wealth crisis… this is the end product.
ya how will you ascertain that whatever certification needed are genuine?
the vaccinated sheep are going to be happy...
for 3 years at the most...
"whatever plan, it doesn't make sense, create more cluster in singapore. now the world is having more cases."
selected countries :)
"i would like to know how singapore government to detect falsified vaccination cert or record?  otherwise, singaporean and residents are at risk!"
"most advanced countries have electronic  certificates on their mobile app in which the personal details should tally with their passports, i presume."
farrah kong us doesn't. profiling is illegal in the us.
"farrah kong  people with photoshop skill can falsified a photo to show vaccination cert that match the passport number (as an example).  remember, people even make fake sinovac vaccine in china..  the breach can have serious consequences."
"come on, everyone yougot money everything can buy ...most scared was human.."
"goaler fc  https://youtu.be/vxs6p5gxv4khttps://youtu.be/vxs6p5gxv4k when this happen in singapore, no matter how much money you have, you can not bring it to after life."

michael  so the name in your driving licence can be different from that in your passport?
"farrah kong  photo , no photo doesn’t matter. falsified doc can be done easily."
"true, it can be seen in video, their vaccination only needle goes in , no vaccine or who knows its just saline water ...."
n y  can share the video link here? thanks
"everything we do, everything in life is full of risks. but we still live."
"vaccinated still spread delta, you mean unvaccinated are at risk?"
"n y if you develop fever like most people, strain on your arms next day or any other minor side effects, you will know its the real vaccine."
"stranded 2020  what do you think? there are many other variant of wu han virus, vaccinated with high efficacy vaccine will help to reduce spread and hopefully reduce icu case and perhaps death.  please advice / talk to those unvaccinated, go discuss with doctor and get high efficacy vaccine jab. low efficacy vaccine simply can not stop spread, and might create a false sense of security, as this virus are easy to spread."

please do see what is happening in u. s.  irregardless of vaccination the infection is exploding again there.
"ong ernie nothing is exploding there and hospitalisations & death rates remain relatively low, check the figures state by state. hence: get vaccinated asap!"
daniel brunner the vaccinated are spreading the delta 💉😷
ong ernie there is no such word as 'irregardless'. it is 'regardless'.
"snowflake melter there is a typo in your message, the unvaccinated are spreading the delta, so get vaccinated asap if you are responsible."
daniel brunner nope it is the jabbed spreading ot everywhere 😷
"snowflake melter unvaccinated people are spreading it all over the place, irresponsible and selfish. if you want to safe lives get vaccinated asap. ok?"
daniel brunner the jabbed are the carriers of the delta. they are spreading it everywhere & are too selfish to quarantine 😷
ong ernie same in uk but ministers say be prepared and it’s no big deal since hospitals are not overwhelmed. higher infection rates is a given .
snowflake melter yes you are right because many dun think they can get infected after vacinnation . fact is when more get vacinnated more of the infected are the from the vacinnated.
"daniel brunner the vaccine fail,most of vaccinated in israel is in icu."
u siow. variant f otw . now variant d vaccinated oso spreadin like wildfires siayouwan allow more to come in? 🤬
how longyouwanna lockdown bro? until singapore is bankrupt and we all begging on the streets?

why do we allow china?
because the whole china has less daily case than singapore has for the past 2 weeks?
china has vaccinated 1.7 billion doses to its population.
cos they have the 💰💰 see how many fnb are owned n run by china chinese ?
"vincecarlo china chinese who goes to another usually set up food business and are self reliant. in most if not all the countries they go to, they are not a burden to those countries."
this shows how naive you are

"yeah! i want vaccinated travel bubble to be set up with india, us and brazil please. ermmm oh yah, and malaysia not to forget."
"no, no, please not malaysia. you want to die ar………..coming from one who is a msian."
all of you must remember wuhan virus started from china now the whole world is suffering with mutated virus
"rubarani v i forgive, but i never forget."
once you're vaccinated why is there a requirement for masks outdoors? what's the point in getting vaccinated then?
"yes ofc, because it still spreads?"
"and you still get infected and spread to others, the only plausible argument now is that you are less likely to die."
ロッチ so gonna wear masks forever then?
kiran raj maybe? why mask must pay money ah
ms ho ching giving out free mask.... those scaddy cat use n95
fg g ok. i take the 2 free ones.
vaccination is to reduce the risk once you get infected. not a cure. are you dumb or what.
those vexinated must be wary of flu because of cytokine storm. the irony.

"primary school should be the top concern as more than 80% of the students are below 12yrs and unvaccinated.  a more comprehensive plan involving test like art should be conducted to protect the students and educators. global travel plans must also include emotional considerations especially for immediate family members who have no chance to unite, serious emotional stress is piling for these families and not just for economic considerations."
where do you get the magic 80% from.?
they are discriminated from dining out with their families  ?
stop abusing children
bad idea
discrimination against those who cannot accept mrna but yet still no non mrna  vaccine available on national program.  worst than racism
ndp songs for singapore  royals nvr take advice from peasants
lol looks like it's eitheryoumiss some part of this latest meeting oryouchoose to ignore 😂
non-vaccinated people with negative pcr test enjoy the same privilege as vaccinated people. singapore offers non-mrna vaccines which are sinovac and sinopharm. what you complaining about?
ona  is sinovac n sinopharm on national program  ?
go watch the other segment dude b4youlook like  some troll..
ona vincecarlo complains on every update. its his job or hobby

jfp has 1000+ cases n created 122 clusters but intends to open no quarantine travel in sep. unbelievable
"a very sensible, pragmatic & logical approach. kudos to the singapore government, for taking steps to restore some semblance of normalcy, within a well charted approach towards protection from covid & the sustainability of our economic survival as a nation."
anyone who study biology of virology will know this will backfire and result in more serious infection!
"what is abnormal, insensible, and illogical is that the mtf is proceeding to open the borders when we see new clusters discovered every day in the community and when we are exactly where we were on may 13 with the daily cases despite 12 weeks of heightened alert. let's see how the mtf can grow the economy when daily cases hit thousands every day. thought the mtf already learnt the lesson last year.  remember what einstein said about insanity."
kathy lim anyone who study economic will know singapore cannot afford to stay lockdown
smallgouphakka no need to study economic to know life is more valuable than money.
richard wong yep. survival is more important and singapore cannot survive if continue to close border for another 10 years.

they let in 750 ppl in and the cases jump from 100 cases to 837 cases daily.  even a 3 year old can tellyouwhat happened and yet we have these overly educated jokers try and twist and squirm and come out with all kinds of outlandish theories which all proven wrong.
hooray! work with the virus!🤩👏💪 those are scared; stay home or leave here asap...lol
疫苗是不可以抵御瘟疫，还开放给700多外国人进来。巴士站都有严重感染了，还开发给外国人进来，笑话啦！自从，那个kamala 到新加坡谈判后，就开始发生变化了。 现在脑残的人太多了。
paying the expert to reiterate common knowledge
no value add! waste tax payers money!
the clowns have poor understanding of endemic which requires mask and social distancing.  now the idiots are pushing the situation towards pandemic with reckless actions.
useless leaders who took life of singapore citizens children and adults as dirt! coming out with their own prognosis of the virus and variant and deciding based on that with no foresight and pushing blame to delta variant when things go wrong like every other third world country leaders!
"good!  singapore has so many covid infection with no symptom, those tourists will have viral souvenirs for free."
their moral compass only points to 💲 sign!
what about foreign students in singapore who would like to see their loved ones and has not seen them in a quite a long time?
"sweden became the second european union country to ban israeli residents from entry due to a rise in covid-19 cases in israel, despite the country being one of the most vaccinated countries in the world.  portugal on wednesday became the first eu country to ban travel from israel due to a rise in cases. both countries are following the eu’s recommendation to remove israel from its list of green countries. on aug. 30, the european union removed the united states, israel, kosovo, lebanon, montenegro, north macedonia, and others from its safe travel list. the list is nonbinding and countries are free to determine their own border policies. in summary, what does it means for countries like israel and singapore to hold the titled of ""most vaccinated nation"" ?"
this only proves that vaxxine is not the solution. only those countries who are truly sovereign and not a puppet to who can make good and honest decision. otherwise it would be nothing but flip-flop traveling policies.
nothing to boast about being the most vexsinated countries!! adversities are increasing due to that dangerous and deadly vexsin !!!!!!
take care of bus drivers infecting passengers and vice versa. air-conditioned bus just circulate the air. if an infected person should be present then your circulating air will be contaminated and infect all the people on the bus. this situation is similar to that of the mrt train rides. for buses better off the air-condition.and open the windows. god bless always.🙏🙏🙏
so when mu corona variant landed singapore?
can indian national apply for this vaccinated travel? anyone?
"nope, only singaporean & pr 🤔"
"karnam malleshwari only if you are vaccinated in singapore or germany, has nothing to do with nationality"
"it seems to me that our government appears to be relying more on vaccination rates than finding ways to prevent the covid from spreading further. i am disappointed. 😢😢😢"
brace for soaring covid cases. singapore citizens’ life are at stake.
"pap trying to earn money and does not care about us getting covid-19, become sick or die. earning money out of our misery and on the corpse of covid-19 death. absolutely inhumane."
"can someone verify if indeed this is on their plan ? ""the world health organization has just released a guiding document for a digital vaccine certificate that will be blockchain based. this will be used to implement a vaccine passport in every country. it’s funded by the gates foundation and rockefeller foundation."""
this will boost spreading once again. mu variant coming.

kl open but jb closed. goes to show how the elite flies while commoners can suck it.
you will ct corvid soon.
"have to say, y'all quite jialat. how to open border with malaysia? actually i got one idea for jb the opening. y'all go count a quota system with jb, per hour how many people can pass in and out, and must be vaccinated. then won't overcrowd the custom, you still keep the malaysian residing and spending in singapore, while they have the opportunity based on a booking system quota to cross back and see their fam in jb. but that being said, i'm aware due to wfh, you may kena some malaysians who sekali come in singapore once a week to go office and balik kampung. but well, we have to start somewhere and jump start the economy. and this prevents the singaporean tourist spending from pouring over, you have malaysians who probably can't quite go back in a frictionless fashion. and likelihood, i think we all singapore will probably set the numbers, just like how i find our custom to be less efficient than the jb side."

"looks like singapore is still putting family matters aside and only super concerned about economy. where is the vtl quarantine free for mothers and fathers to meet their children in singapore? vtl must give serious thoughts to those poor family members who are fully vaccinated but yet not able to go to singapore to meet their immediate family members. selfish acts, only concerned about country's economy but not the citizens' personal desperate emotions of separation blues from their loved family members. this is madness, so much wait for vaccine and now with vaccination completed still so difficult. singapore must consider opening vtl to all countries in the world who has family members in singapore!"
not. happy. singapore political  racism countery india. why
before many travelers from endya have been coming to singapore with daily imported cases so now give chance to others. the more you say bad about singapore the more singapore may close and padlock door to endya for the longest time.
so should not say bad to singapore.then door will be open to endya.
this policy same as legalize drugs
sinkor variant  sounds deathly. 👏👏👏
quarantine free ? the moment you're tested antigen positive you're immediately under quarantine. so never be fooled by the mainstream media bluffs.
of course you should be quarantine if tested positive.

singapore has achieved 80% fully vaccinated. it's the right time to slowly open up to get business rolling again. continued lock downs will starve people to death.
"unlink cases maybe due to delivered packages of goods and food packs. the delivery guy could also be the culprit spreading the virus. he is moving here and there, lots of opportunities to catch the virus. so best to have a drop off points for delivery items for less personal contact with the delivery guy. we know that covid 19 can ""cling"" onto materials, such as cartons and bags. best if you can get a plastic overall you can use when handling/sanitize the deliveries be sure to sanitize these items (packings ,bags etc.)before  storing. and just to be sure to also clean your hands after. god bless always.🙏🙏🙏"

"cna hire her for her propaganda act and face, just like trump hired kayleigh mccrazy"
"most locals in singapore do not speak with any accent. you definitely do not have real knowledge about singapore. those foreigners from india, for example, speak with an indian accent. foreigners such as british, spanish, german, etc speak english with their own accent."
germany just announced 4th wave n  &gt;11k in a day brunei has record 120 local infections n 11 clusters.  bring back more infections . more biz to close with more restrictions for locals geniuses  👍👏👏👏
hospitals will have more businesses. 👏👏👏👏👏
"vax companies will make alot of profit 😁😁😁. new variants, new vax to jab. 😂😂😂"
trusting the vexsin to protect?? foolishness!!
get ready....  wait for it..... 500 daily cases!!!!
and? who cares?
i will not trust someone who spell vaccine like that. ask your god for some spellings lesson
gioni are you a facebook or google factchecker ?
good luck

vexsin weaken your immune system!! that's y you are easily infected!! say  no to vexsin
"singapore covid math, vax make singapore x10 less likely for serious illness. but covid is spreading at x100 times the rate vs last year ... ending up with serious case and death rates at x10 greater. only singapore mtf and prof mak can end up with such calculated conclusion and still have their million $$$ jobs and say they are in control of the situation."
intelligent hawk well said now they are using 0.  to report cases and fatalities
"want to learn the meaning of the words ""ta pau""? come to singapore, with 3k+ cases pd you sure can find a hawker center where you can ""ta pau"" covid. we can also teach you the word ""kenna""."

god's amazing grace  just ignore magus thor (3 wks) & justfair ( 2 mths) both accts are 1 n the same lap 🐕🏀👅 fake account spewing 💩💩💩
fully vexsinated has become a term used loosely because your vexsination status changes quickly  unless you get regular booster shots as updates!! they called it refresher say  no to vexsin !!
the strange thing is that these posters are all fully vaccinated.
jean yip营运总监叶佩芬向《联合晚报》证实，去世的男子林连声（译名，kent lim lian seng，54岁）. “我们询问同事才知道，他在9日接种了第三剂冠病疫苗后还回来上班，事隔11天后，在星期三（20日）下午4点左右，他说身体不舒服就请假回家。” 隔天一早，叶佩芳便接到林连声妻子的电话，告知林连声去世了。
another vexsin fatality this time from booster shot which they will never admit it's the vexsin some perished at first dose some second and then some after booster!! this vexsin is the real danger !!
"god's amazing grace i also heard that from the malay telegram channel. although all the mainstream media here refuse to acknowledge. because they just want all the seniors to go for booster. this is not the first time booster dose causing fatalities. in summary, never tempt with fate. every single dose can be fatal irrespective of what age."
"if i were living in australia which has so vast prestine scenery unseen elsewhere in the world, why would i need to go elsewhere for leisure? maybe only when no choice then need to travel eg to buy roti prata from singapore?"
you are so gullible and your views are so  simplistic.  go ask australians why so many travel abroad.

"magnus thor ...ostriches, are the majority.  i did also said that after september things will progressively become a strain on healthcare due to reckless management of the pandemic."
"carl jay   we are into the endgame.  they now permit hospital staff to travel oversea.  this is a big and bold step forward.  when they have the courage to open up, whyyoudont have the courage to wish them luck?  of course no one can definitively predict the next month have in store for us.  we can try and be positive and nothing good will come out from being negative."
"magnus thor, i haven't the mood nor time to debate about who's seeing clearer.  i'll just let time show the true reality."
carl jay  that why i saidyoudoom sayer.  you already made up your mind that nothing they do is good.
uhh don't talk cock uh
tightening and punishing singaporeans.   relax and easing foreigners.  something is seriously wrong with singapore govt.     why would anybody vote for a govt to screw yourself?
"as more vtls are established, it is hoped that mmtf / moh / hsa/ mom / ica / tourist promotion board / hotel associations could quickly come up with solid strategies to safeguard singapore from imported cases & spread of covid-19. special effort & clear & distinct separation of access / ingress / egress, transit routes & service staff routes, disinfection processes & controls of non hospital facilities that are serving as dedicated quarantine  facilities and are gearing up to receive more vtls guests from other countries. thanks."
"we ""believe"" what you said.😉😉😉"
"who cares whatyou""believe""?"
so vaccinated...dont spread the virus...so vaccination is bullet vest...but singaporean vaccinated...still getting virus and dying...and still spread to unvaccinated...first time in history vaccine is not working...and put the blame on unvaccinated 15% to 20% of the population...reason to save them frm sever effects frm covid19...so who the spreaders????
obviously the vexsinated !!. they are the speedy silent spreaders because they shed the virus fragments!! now moh don't even report on them anymore because they are the spreaders

"most singaporeans are not even aware of civil war broke out in australia and switzerland. massive walkout of construction workers rendered melbourne construction sector totally come into a standstill. while massive protest become daily event in all major cities in switzerland. so who are those ""travellers"" from australia and switzerland ?  unvaccinated australians and swiss ? you don't welcome them. vaccinated australians and swiss ? they are too busy fighting with their fellow citizens. so you think all this ""vaccinated lane"" bullcrap make believe pom-pom girl show is going to hide the truth ? c'mon man ! don't keep play wayang leh"

taiwan had an outbreak in may but it was contained by august. the average cases is zero or one each day in taiwan now. i’m pretty sure singapore will be able to control this in a few month too. you can’t expect perfection.

nothing wrong with changing tactics why be a dead duck?
"singapore stupid to think it can reopen borders unilaterally without keeping local infection numbers low. every other country will be looking at singapore's infection numbers. if the numbers continue to be high, they will all one by one shut singapore out. and it's back to square one, with sia , changi airport and a host of other things affected. except this time, infections are out of control and people are dying daily, in the double digits when in the past, there was hardly any deaths. the govt's overconfidence, arrogance and complacency has backfired and undone all the hard work and effort to keep singapore safe and almost free from covid. living with covid19 is wrong messaging by the singapore govt. rather it should be to continue to adapt to living cautiously with a dangerous virus."

you are correct. you watch their press conferences. then you watch the strain on their faces as they answer the questions. like suffering from constipation. so yes. the mtf strain is worse than delta.
"for your report on (nov 12), does it mean that except for 1 person, the rest of the 13 who died are vaccinated?☠😟 ""14 more people died from complications due to the coronavirus. the fatalities were aged between 35 and 102. all of them, except for an unvaccinated case, had various underlying medical conditions."""
"you are correct. the last few days reports didn't mention unvaccinated deaths. so it can be assumed all vaccinated. moh says one in three suffers from diabetes, an underlying condition. what the mmtf is telling us is we shouldn't worry until we reach 2 million deaths?"
"in corporate reporting, if you do not present comparison of figures in a uniform manner, you be fired. pap is exempted for all standards because they change the rules all the time! sometimes report daily figures as of 12 noon, sometimes happy happy report as of 11pm. sometimes report death rates breakdowns, sometimes omit vac/unvac. <b>roti prata shop management</b>"

"yep, it's becoming clearer people no longer believe vaccinated individuals are safe and do not pose dangers to others."
"how areyougoing to pass thru changi airport without vaxx? its the same, whatever  denmark  is. do you all know singapore post centre which is an essential services, houses a dbs bank and a social welfare departments, both public services, bars all unvaxx and sinovac visitors!  we citizens have this to say, singapore post has never been given a god given right to mandate 💉. it is complicit in international law.  if the government aint going to abide international law, it is imperative that it returns all seniors' cpf and allow them to migrate if they wish to. strangely, india and taiwan vaxx rate only less twenty%, no longer breaking news or co vi dd???"

however they are not translated into serious or icu cases. it just show us that the virus is here to stay and its wise to realise it. live with the virus is the correct way. how else?
vaxed / infected asymptomatic are the ones going around spreading the virus. they are the silence carriers with no social responsibilities. after they check into hawker center they mask down to talk face to face and less than a meter apart.

i also don't understand. singaporeans get locked in all those housing flats all their lives but never feel lacking freedom but covid lockdown was too much for them once the border was opened they had to go holiday!
"had singapore gahmen ordered snap 14 days lockdown in early last month, it all could be long over by today and case would drop drastically. but what they did? just announced stupid dine in restrictions. now eu is imposing restrictions on us, whose faults?"
"earlier lockdowns also no use when they didn't do pcr test on everyone. why? because they're afraid of the numbers and too lazy to do the work required to stop the spread. wayang only. in the meantime they bought a stake in pfizer. now at 86% all you hear from them is vaccination, vaccination. on hindsight, we know the plan was hatched much earlier than we were told."
eu takes singapore and ukraine off safe list for travel -  simple solution. take more boosters. come on singapore - mandatory 3rd shot after 6 months please
why go eu ? who go there ?
chin ying loong you will be stunt when traveling eu is a necessity like drinking water for quite a handful of people.
how dare they insinuate that singapore is going through a pandemic of the vaccinated !
why like that ? we are number one if not number two in vaccination rate in the entire world leh. even otters are vaccinated 5 times each....and they are still green and alive 
"singapore was the toast of the world with few covid deaths and daily cases. the world would love to crowd into our super safe island nation! but it was closed.  so, singapore ministers decided to open up and reconnect with the world. even if it means sacrificing our people's lives (about 500 deaths since opening up a few weeks ago) and exploding daily cases - latest 230 thousands. a popular country is still nothing if admiring foreigners don't come.  but now the admiring world is beginning to shun us! the us a couple weeks ago already re-classifies singapore in the high travel risk category. now eu is doing something similar. oh no!"
then don't come lor. why scare ?
chin ying loong please dun say that and make pinky cry.
"only old people have proven to die, and so what? at 70 they're useless, they can't vote in the next election. die then die. why should the govt save a few lives, and what more when the bulk of them are unvaccinated. and in return sacrifice the economy and the future of people in their 20s who have to hide because of a few stubborn people? if you're below 60 and vaccinated, none have died."

yes. eu is only 1 of the the many countries that blacklist singapore. anyone one can just try emailing singapore embassy in other countries and will be surprised
"at the end of the day livelihoods matter a lot. in usa , 18 million people are living below poverty line. here you kpkb against the govt.  got eyes see no tarzan"
justfair  you forgotten something about this govt. the only reason for that vtl is to make sure that shareholders do not dump their shares in our airlines. plus to bring in more eps n sp holders into the country. mom has been without levy the last 1 year.  this is not about the singapore core or singaporeans.  this is about their wealth created while in office n their darling foreigners n foreign entities.  so just get off your high horse.  most retrenched workers are foreigners who need to go home.  no wonder you have your panty in a bunch. globalisation has a price.  it took the livelihood of singaporeans the last 15 years. now it is just payback time. so stop being salty.

justfair  never forget singapore started with nothing too.  don’t give me that crap.  displacing the core citizens who built this nation just for profit is what this is all about.  why not deal with the issues at home n your own government rather than just taking away others livelihood.  if you think there is no poverty in singapore you are totally blinded by the propaganda n all that pr stunt of the government to the world.  what we have here is called urban poverty n it is as real as any in the rest of the world.  with no land n natural resources pulling oneself out of that kind of poverty is far more difficult.  it is a vicious cycle of social issues. try looking at both side of the coin for once in your life.  it is not always about you n your kind! it is justfair i guess many are in disagreement with u.
shiela tee  go and watch .be objective.  don't kpkb here
shiela tee  we started with nothing but today we are prosperous and we'll managed .for us to lose if we are not pragmatic. do less g bashing.  be objective and see the world for comparison
justfair  i seen all the poverty to seen out there.  i am more focus on my home ground n backyard.  letting our own go hungry n displaced. the issues brought about greedy leaders in your country n government is not on me.  i am not here to correct the wrong n injustice in other part of the world.  kindness n charity begins at home.  you just watch it yourself if it makeyoujustify your blind support for a bunch of sellouts in office.  don’t worry they are there for the likes ofyounot the singapore core.
justfair  not with the kind of leadership in office.  they have destroyed everything good about this country to just sit back n cash in.  like i say…you can continue with your blind faith in them.  singaporeans are built strong.  we can always built this nation again if we need to.  the infrastructure n institutions are not broken but under a shameless useless pm n those in the pmo.  we just might! you have a lot of learning to do about the world of politics.  you are just concern about you n your kind. no fault in caring about them but not on the backs of my people.
shiela tee  what you have now is for you to lose.its like a soccer match. you just need a draw to clinch the championship.dont let the goals in. don't be complacent.  the world really don't owe you a living.
justfair  we have lost so much…more than you could ever imagine. while the ones in office holding on tight to their wealth n position. you are just kept in the dark.  the only way to find out is for the ruling party to lose power n we open up the books for all to see.  the reason why that useless pm appointed a non malay to be our president.  if we ever to go to the polls.  dr tcb of psp will take it from under him.  your pm is all dandy about gambling with the people lives n livelihood but having dr tan in office will destroy his political career. that will be one can of worm 🪱 that useless pm will never be able to close. there are so many moving parts in government.  i really hate to repeat myself 🙄🙄🙄 you are just focus on you n your kind.  so live with it. be well.  don’t pull me into your sob story n propaganda.
justfair  i am not asking the world to take care of me.  i do it all myself. this is not about me.  life have been really good to me.  nothing was a given. all of us the singapore core worked for it. we just deserve sound leadership for all not just one faction of society. that is your first mistake…using a lame argument ~ the world don’t owe you anything.  this is personal to you.  it is not for me. thus the difference in our intention n goal.
"shiela tee  your definition of sound leadership is different from me.we should be able to accept this as mature people. however doing g bashing with biased comments show immaturity.  it's good you can take care of yourself. but to do gutter politics here is shameful to the world. others can read what you post.its unhealthy. if you need to hate, go ahead and do it on election day. why kpkb with such long pieces of never ending grouses?"
justfair  yeap i do agree with different opinions n definition.  you call it bashing… i call it keeping them straight n honest.  maturity???  i am looking for integrity intelligence n insights in a sound leadership.  you just looking for what works in your favour.  that is not maturity than is just your common garden variety of selfishness. no wonder you are so into this current administration.  to know a person look at the company he keeps.  don’t you know your useless pm are bff with the disingaporeraced thief of a expm najib.  let’s just keep to our lanes.  we will never agree on anything.
justfair  the loser comment ~ hate to hate something or someone it must begin with love.  none there… i do want the world to know so that they will not fall into the pm honeytrap. trying to get australia to sign ceca will cause too much disruption in their economy.  they are still struggling with madxi china tantrum. to the world leaders…do choose your battles.  one crisis at a time. please! don’t end up like our pmo.  throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks including the kitchen sink.  that is not the making of a smart nation.
shiela tee  the long hate posts of toxicity 🤣🤣🤣 i feel shy to read.
justfair  so don’t…  leaders are readers. like you highlighted i m doing it for the world 😉
shiela tee  clearly i am no match for your level of ignorance 🤣🤣🤣
justfair  i too no match for your arrogance.
shiela tee  when they do well. we praise when they do badly. we criticise. when they play with our lives. we bash. no need to feel apologetic about it.
jp phua  on point…speaking like a true blue singaporean 👍👍👍
jp phua  are you vaccinated?
justfair  did you just fart?
"shiela tee  was that good or what? credit to a fellow commentator who love him as much as we do, woofwoofchs."
shiela tee  ahhh... the gifts god give us to keep us entertained.
jp phua  are you vaccinated? if not why?
jp phua in a world full of people you can lose sight of it all the darkness inside you can make you feel so small🤣🤣🤣🤣
justfair  you fart again. please don't do that. it's very rude.
"jp phua  if i say you low class, crying all the time. if i say base class, whining all the time🤣🤣🤩😛"
"shiela tee  ""did you just fart?"" four simple words no longer than four letters each. the power is carries to make grown men cry and blabber out of control. you can even mix them around. like ""just fart did you?"". it doesn't diminish its power. never underestimate the power of small words."
"shiela tee  if you take the ""f"" away from the word ""fart"". it becomes ""art"". therefore, farting is an art form of self expression. some people just do it louder and longer than others. we cannot deny them that right."
justfair those 18 million ok leh. go china 6 billion lor
shiela tee you lose a lot. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
jp phua  they are indeed sports for us.  a bunch of loser is just the best source of entertainment.  this is not cyber bullying.  this is just dishing out as much as they are throwing at us.  the days of being quiet 🤐 is sooo over!  to know they are losing the battle n their marbles is when they start quoting some mountain poetry plus all the smiley icons 🤣🤣🤣 that is their to go surrender mode.  there is a pattern to their stupidity n arrogance.  so i just wait for the bukit/mountain poetry to come out.  then only i stop n let them be 😉 i just scored a point 💪
justfair  farting produces methane gas and causes global warming. try to limit your emission.
justfair  why do you keep asking the same stupid question? as if i'm going to answer. no wonder you call yourself just fart.
"justfair  i won't ask you a stupid question like  ""what have you been doing the whole day?"" because i know your answer will be ""just fart."" don't even try to play games with me. you don't know who you're dealing with."
"jp phua ok phuachee, will not answer you🤣🤣"
jp phua  some broken chees are hard to mend
justfair  you just fart again. is that even a word? try harder next time.
justfair  it's obvious to everyone right now. you don't talk. you just fart.
"jp phua  yes phua chee.broken ones make the most noise. once broken, hard to repair. no one has the expertise.  pitiful indeed 🤣🤣🤣"
jp phua  phua chee does fart 🤣 😳
"justfair  you just fart again. the surname phua does not mean broken. the word chee, you just pull it out from the same place you fart. this is not working for you. why don't you entertain us with the homeless in america again instead?"
"justfair  are you referring to the part of the human anatomy where your mother gave birth to you? can't be a bad word, can it. your mother fart from there? come on, you can't be that disrespectful to your mother, can you? try again. just fart."
jp phua  haha pehaps i give you a better one phua hai 🤣🤣🤣
"justfair  phua chee and phua hai to you as well, just fart. i don't even know what they mean. must be some kind of greetings you just invented. returning the same greetings to you so as not to appear rude."
"justfair  okay just fart. i think i know what you're refering to. muah chee, the glutinous cake desert that's covered in grounded peanut. correct?"
jp phua  good morning phua  hai chee😅
"justfair  so can you confirm what you're refering to, just fart? the place from which you were born that's broken, or the chinese desert?"
jp phua  no wonder a freak was born
justfair  ya lor. the freak greeting phua hai chee when there are only two people here. jp phua and just fart.
jp phua  you seems to like your name phua hai chee.freaks like this type of name
justfair  you just fart again. there's no phua hai chee here. only jp phua and just fart. phua hai chee only lives in your head and you're obsessed with it. go see a psychiatrist.
jp phua  phua hai chee of course can fart. be a bit imaginative and stop acting like a toddler
justfair  i don't know who phua hai chee is. you engage in imagination. i only engage in reality. that's why you call yourself just fart.
shiela tee  winning has become so easy that its becoming boring. it's like a computer game. our territory keeps expanding and his keep shrinking. he digs himself a hole and now the game changes to whack-a-mole. he raises his head and i whack it with a hammer. it's no more a challenge of minds. it's now a test of his level of shamelessness and how low he can go.
justfair  you are right. that part of the female anatomy has to be broken in order to give birth to you. it should be respected. not joked about. just fart .
"jp phua it was not shown in my name. yours to be exact.phua hai chee. hello, phua hai chee🤣🤣🤣"
"justfair  everybody calls me jp phua. you can call me anything you like. happy? you want another sweet, little toddler? you just fart again."
justfair  you can say it a hundred times. i'm not bothered by it. maybe you can talk about homelessness in america after that. just fart.
jp phua  thanks for the generosity.  jia pui phua chee might not be bad too.please inform your friends
jp phua  add another adjective to your title
"justfair  you're welcomed. you're so obedient and cute. i asked for a hundred names and you gave me one more. you have 99 more to go. please continue, just fart."
"justfair  let me do a summation. you have nothing to say about the subject matter. you bring up homelessness in america for the purpose of carrying pap's balls. we, singaporeans have every right to kpkb and bash our government when they play with our lives allowing foreigners to spread the virus without quarantine. who the hell gives you the right to reprimand singaporeans on their legitimate rights to bash its government?"
justfair  the last time i heard the likes of your vulgarities was among gangsters around my neighborhood with no education in the 70s. many of them have been in and out of prison. that's how pathetic you are. you cannot even acknowledge that you came out from your mother by way of the place you described. you're just an uncouth misogynist. have you no shame?
"justfair  just fart is not my creation. i borrowed it from a fellow commentator with his expressed permission. he said to treat you like a rag. another suggested not fair. many expressed their appreciation for calling you out. never have i seen  anyone more hated by the community. i'll give you a chance for you to do a summation. but i know you only have 3 words. ""i just fart"""
jp phua  good am phua haichee
"justfair  as predicted. i gave you a chance to do a summation. and you replied, ""i just fart."" pathetic."
"jp phua  good am phua hai chee, how is your day? 🤣🤣"
jp phua  i can change my name to justmend but you can't. how sad.😅😅
justfair  who is phua hai chee?
jp phua  who ah? can you tell me?
"justfair  everybody calls me jp phua. i cannot help you if you choose to be stubborn. you can call me anything you want. pets can't talk anyway. dogs call me woof woof. cats call me meow. which category of pets do you belong to? other than being the obedient pet that you are, greeting me every morning, do you have a question to ask?"
jp phua  you want me to ask you questions? i prefer not to receive incoherent answers. do you have friends at all?all you can do is do what you must you do what you must do and yes do it well.did you?
"justfair  just fart is not a name. it's a verb. you can change your name anytime you want, but you're still just fart."
"justfair  you prefer not to receive answers but you continue to ask questions. stupid right? like an obedient pet, you greet me every morning. yes, i consider you as a friend."
jp phua  he offered his innocence but got repaid with scorn some strange little geek who acts like a freak🤣🤣🤣
justfair  you've gone loco again. you can't handle this much mental stress. just take a break for your own good. okay?
"jp phua people are crazy and times are strange i'm locked in tight, i'm out of range🤣🤣🤣"
jp phua some things are too hot to touch the human mind can only stand so much🤣🤣🤣
justfair  yes. bob dylan is your go to whenever you're in survival mode. listen to idiot wind and do some self reflection.
jp phua  whine less there's lot of  wrong directions on that lonely way back home. count your blessings 🤣🤣🤣
jp phua sometimes you think it's a shame when you get feeling better when you're feeling no pain. i understand you need to whine  to ease the http://pain.today/pain.today i forgive you
justfair  do you know any other words besides whine?
jp phua blasphemy.🤣🤣🤣
justfair  just fart. i'm done for the day. pap paw lum par. please continue with your whining.
justfair  why complain about people whining when all you know how to do is just fart? and paw lum par.
justfair  just stick to what you do best. farting and paw lum par.
jp phua  using vulgar words? no more vocab?hiding  intentions of evil under the smile of a saint all he's good for is gettin' in trouble and shifting his share of the blame grow up and get a life.🤣🤣🤣
justfair  you can deflect and deny. but everybody knows you're only good at farting and paw lum par.
justfair  no need more vocab. just fart and paw lum par describes you just fine.
justfair  vulgar to you because the truth hurts. people use just fart and paw lum par like you would any other words. no need to be extra sensitive unless it hurts.
"justfair  baby farts. parents go "" oh oh. baby just fart"" everyone laughs. how is that vulgar? unless yours is extra smelly."
"justfair  elder brother cannot have extra sweets  younger brother whisper sweet nothings to parent. gets extra sweets. elder brother tells younger brother, "" paw lum par."" younger brother laughs and walks away. how is that vulgar? you tell me."
justfair  so the only two questions that needs to be answered.... 1. how much of what you say is relevant and how much is just fart? the answer is quite obvious. 2. why you keep pawing the pap lum par? what do you stand to gain from that?
"jp phua good evening mr hai. you got bad breaks well, that's tough luck you've played too hard too much rough stuff🤣🤣🤣"
"justfair  seriously you need professional help. you're talking to made up people inside your head. anyway good evening just fart pap paw lum par. yes, i'm talking to you. not some made up person in my head. this is getting too boring. all things must come to an end. i'm turning off all notifications from you. so don't bother replying. adios amigo."
"jp phua  good evening phua hai chee, how is your day?"
jp phua  so what language do little minions speak exactly? care to share🤣🤣
really what lie? trolls!!!
correct like ask all the ft come here to earn singapored. should say who go back. one way ticket
she is a troll. vulgar too🤣
chin ying loong  sing dollar drop  i usd = 2.4 sing dollars already
fiost hahahahahahaha. then you go sell ur singapored at that rate lor
"they are the best at worst.  how come one person only knows one word ""troll"" and the other only knows another word ""whiner"". and they keep repeating themselves. funny."
chin ying loong  i want to buy all his singapored. you want or not? almost 85% instant profit. no need to wait.
"can’t fool the eu, can’t fool the people. what’s the next step? can’t just let more than 10 people die in a day."
the earliest china would open up its border is said to be end of 2022. 🇨🇳💪💪💪
that's awesome. this is what i called respecting the virus
2025 lah. no problem one. orgin country ok.
"it will be good if china closes its border the longer the better and prohibit their citizens out for  leisure travel. 😂😂. without ccp, there is no new earth.🤣🤣🤣🤣"
richard w yeah then please go live there then.
lisa lim love to. but i’m now stuck in denmark for quarantine.
richard wong really then enjoy your qo as is nosense to qo for long period and killing people livehood when the lives are not loss for majority of people
richard w  china may collapse with a mere 2% growth this year
china also upped its restriction on singapore. all incoming from singapore must go for covid test 3 days before departure date and then have go through the 21 days quarantine.
how can....china & singapore  are like brothers....anyway no holidays  for my khakis  until masks off....
only fair that they protect themselves. no blame.
china taking back taiwan soon lor
"covid-vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine-sulfate. covid-19 is cumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated. peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak'""1"
dont understand why so eager for holiday??
do business
my exact thought. itchy backside. too much money sitting around.
no name who getting covid overseas is deemed atas.
"richard wong "" yah lor, i kena covid while i was in europe, so sian siah"" conversation that will roll my eyes"
obviously vaccine is not wrking. reseaechers pls do more n come up wf a truly effective vaccine. whether you succumb to synptoms or not of covid 19 still depends on your natural body constituition n immune system. good luck.
"remember the good old kampong days at jalan kayu, there are lots of kan cheong spider. my mum always spray lots of insecticide, banned them from entering our house. missed those days."
"i am from jalan kayu too, lorong ranting - the old cinema area."
yes there was also a jalan whining.
"fiost  do you know any other word besides""whining""? so you ran away from another thread in shame just to join another to make a fool of yourself. so predictable."
spiders are not insects btw 😒
"get your house in order before you do everything else. remember,  it takes 2 hands to clap."
but it only take one hand to slap
"smart decision by eu.  can't  say much for mtf. still want to negotiate open border with malaysia? like it or not permit holders have to wait even longer for border reopenning. they have choices to go home but not to their convenient(no one stopping if they don't want to come back). land movement need more planning compare to air travel(even we know malaysia still unstable) especially when we have over 200k workers going to cross the causeway daily. they demand  freedom to come in/out but show no sense of social discipline when they gate crash inter state. it can happen at border. it will create more pressure to singapore customs. when something goes wrong,  they are good finding a scapegoat. ☺"
"mo zart who will go eu from singpaore ? only a few business man. or else no one will go travel so far away one. malaysia different, you eat vegetable daily from there. did you scare the vegetable got covid-19 ? don't eat lah"
"chin ying loong finally someone who talk the most sense today,"
no wonder it was raining just now🤣
"chin ying loong unless they are not desperate to import, singapore have own source of agriculture and other countries support. but can't blame senior citizen are use to eat malaysian import veg.. ☺"
fiost it will rain heavier  if border don't open.  😂
mo zart  i thought the composer wrote this song: rain rain rain rain my pillow's soaking wet🤣
chin ying loong how about all the expats that pay shitloads more tax than you?
"fiost  no more ""whining""?"
helmos then go back lor. pay what tax ? rubbish we all know you pay nothing
"helmos of coz need pay tax lar. stay condo, drive car, makan atas restaurant everyday. pay tax is a fraction of their income here can.."
good job eu countries! protecting your citizens is key.
"if they know how to protect , then the deaths should not be 1000/ million. we don't know to protect but we keep it at 50/ million who is a better govt?"
fiost we are the highest infection per million. this death in the icu stays in icu. no one really knows during the first year of spread as the cases are of fws n immigrant workers. now most of it is in the community. trying to hide their death will be hell to pay. a blind mindless sheep 🐑 at work.
shiela tee  people based on deaths lah infection is nothing
fiost truly brainwashed. it has always been about the number of cases including deaths. else why is everyone reporting it?
shiela tee report also say not enough. report then say not true story. never report then say govt nvr pay close attention to it. whatyouwant
calvintimtoms  when the report is just a read out from a script with no real knowledge of what is going on with the people n on the ground. it is just useless just like them.  it is all about ~ how do i manipulate these data to look less stupid n not an utter failure.  excuse explaining their missteps is why they are reporting too much. just to cover their asses.  yet the blame will always be on the people.  thus the ridiculous covid measures that changes every time someone sneeze.  why open up n continue to import cases knowing our limited resources n how unprepared they are to handle any surge in cases. that is just http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dumb101#dumb101 it doesn’t need a rocket science to figure that out.  as 70% of businesses in singapore are foreign owned. their lapses in monitoring their activities is just a disaster waiting to happen.  as they are so single minded in the way they run this country.  their focus was ~ the snake oil pill call vaccine. do that n their job is done. i just rather they just shut up for once.  the more they talk the worst it is.  there is a real disconnect with all their talk n what happening on the ground. these are a bunch who never really work the last 10 years in office.  their favourite past time during the weekend is planting a tree.  handling a crisis is just not one of them. politicians fronting a health crisis is the worst bit.  btw where is your bloody pm. he should be the front man in a all politician covid taskforce if that is the way he wants things done. he is just not man enough to handle all the backlash coming his way.  now you know why these useless ministers are paid millions for their services.  just to take the heat off that useless pm.
"shiela tee well said. the disappearance of the pm is the biggest sore thumb.this is just a double whammy. you invite, people don't want to come. you want to visit, people dont welcome you.the mtf can lie to us everyday. but they can't fool foreigners. getting to be an embarrassment being singaporean."
jp phua  i totally agree…why doyouthink they pushed the fica bill in parliament in a record time of just 10hrs…a mere 1 day working day. that sure earn the mps their 16k salary.  to be told it was in works the last 3 years with no one knowing about it. unbelievable. not realising the last 2 years everyone up to their eyeball with their dumb covid strategies n measures. that is what a blatant lie to the face looks like n they are the best at it.
jp phua dont agree you and shiela are two troll spotted.
lisa lim  we are citizens calling out the bs of your useless pm n his administration.  when they earn their keeps from the tax dollars…paying themselves well. it comes with the job! can see you never work in a large organisation or an mnc.  it is call accountability n responsibility. look it up! so get off your made in china or india box…choose your poison.  don’t do loser statement.  trolls…the moment we don’t bow down to a bunch of utter uselessness in office.
shiela tee really look like you don't understand what is call the virus is here to stay and have to live with it.
"lisa lim  just shut up if you don't have an argument to make. this is a public forum where adults discuss important stuff. if your purpose is to parrot the pap's talking point, go find a children's playground to play in."
their medical lousy lah.
lisa lim  that endemic pipe dream 💭 went down the drain while they are sleeping 😴 on the job.  most endemic nation uses the descorn measurement tool to minimise wastage of manpower in collecting n collating data.  alas with all that data…they still can’t understand it.  for goodness sake the whole bloody singapore map looks like someone had a bloody fight n lost.  they are the losers n you coming after me.  we the people have been living with covid the last 2 years from all the incompetence coming out of the pmo n his administration.  so just shut up already.  go ask min ong n min wong pick up that descorn tool from outside the window.  remember their words ~ we will never go red!  whose the fool now!
"jp phua i dont feel you are adults i am afraid, i dont parrot anyone. i am talking sense as this virus is here to stay so you mean what we close border and lockdown for how much longer?"
lisa lim  go find your place in the playground. seriously.
don't include me in the we the citizens...shy eh
jp phua  maybe a stalker would better described you🥵😰
fiost  never in this lifetime… you are just scrambling to stay alive here.  you just have no where to go huh!? must be on a government scholarship.  no wonder so grateful.  just to remind you. that is not the pm bloody money.  it is from the people ~ the taxpayers.
fiost  i don't pay attention to what stupid people like you have to say.
jp phua  ya dont bother with an 18 year old boy la. he just got youtube account and started spewong nonsense and insults. doesnt know what the hell is going on outside his bedroom and probably still living in the comfort of his parents house without having worked his first job yet.  dont bring yourself to his level. dont bother arguing with a minor.
shiela tee  i am trying to natch lah should thank me
clive ng  i am not insulting anyone. i am trying to teach  them not to spread hate against our govt. its not fair. people go to war because of fairness. you should also do your part to discourage them not to spread hate. it's not good for our country
jp phua  you should thank me too. i am trying to natch for you
fiost  hate??? not hate we are trying to stop a unsound leader doing damage to the country n people.  even a coin has 2 sides… you just can’t handle truth.  you just prefer to be ignorant. easier to sleep at night. teach??? dear god the arrogance n condescending tone just make many hate people like you who go blindly into the abyss…even more now i realised you are a lost cause.  go bow down to your master.
clive ng  🤣🤣🤣 18 year old n still wet behind the ears huh!? the malay have a saying ~ can’t even pee straight yet want to teach others… 🤣🤣🤣 thank you for spilling the tea.  no wonder still reading mountain poetry.  so we have an airy fairy boy 🧚‍♂️ here.
fiost comparing eu with small red dot? pathethic calculation. 😂 😂
shiela tee  how do you pee? mind to tell us? by peeing into the tea.something new for me🤣🤣
shiela tee  you said i can't handle truths. quite true. i am an expert in handling lies.hence you see me🤣🤣
clive ng  i do know what's the hell going on outside my bathroom 🤣🤣
"clive ng  i cannot be bothered. once in a while, i'll take a dig at them because their stupidity makes it irresistible. we stand tall everyday criticising the government simply because we know we, the people deserve better. in the hope that they'll do better by all singaporeans, not just the privileged. we have our voice and we must use it. to me, they're just entertaining us and providing comic relief. i touch. i go. and i allow them to make complete fools of themselves. they persist because they know no shame. nothing more. nothing less."
jp phua  you didn't thank me leh
jp phua  you are ungratefully using your sore voice to sing the same old nagging songs.must  be a deprived person.  the weak can never appreciate. self entitled.  at least you must thank me for the natch
fiost  you are not making any sense at all.  think comprehend the meaning than comment.
fiost  can see you are not one of us local singaporeans.  don’t give away too much of yourself.  focus on your schooling. finish that first then get an education before coming at me.  i really hate…this is clear unadulterated hate a loser try to act smart.
"shiela tee  you watched how kindness kills. it's now time to employ a new strategy. the silent assassin. if you notice he's incapable of any original idea. he's just bouncing off our comments. so if we ignore him, he's deprived of oxygen and dies a natural death. there are many of us. there's only one of him. we win by sheer numbers. it's not necessary to go tit for tat. he doesn't know he's dealing with a master of the game. i've seen idiots like him come and go. and most don't end well for them. just ignore him and he'll self implode."
jp phua  the truth is ~ i m doing this for fun.  stringing him along.  the moment he is quoting some mountain poetry i know he is such a goner. the thing is he is just fixated on me  🤣🤣🤣 i have that effect on people 😉🤪 just let me have my fun after a long day. i agree critical mass will tired them out.  i am glad to see that happening the last year.  real voices from the ground seeing light. only then we can start to see change.
jp phua  i love that ~ we know we the people deserve better… for all not some is why we seem to be fighting a losing battle.  i want that useless pm out of office.  he do not deserve anything that way handed to him on a silver platter!  a shameless son of singapore!
"fiost you contradict yourself. from preaching about not spreading hate and not going to war, you have also insulted other commenters from making childish bathroom  comments to calling people derived and self entitled. and like a narcissist, insist that people ‘thank’ you. it’ll be better if you excuse yourself here. just trying to save yourself the embarrassment."
st  he's shameless. that's all he is.
vaccine works
works to infect more and more with no ending in sight. never ending woes ; n.e.w
malaya harimau every body know that is what i mean haha. if vaccine work why we are nr 1 in high number of cases with 85 % double vaccinated people
gamer studio exactly.
sarcasm at its best 👍👍👍
all the yakkers here
bmpcos congratulations on your new- youtube channel with 1000 coment - what you do with this channel : only write coments?
gamer studio  i am just doing some national service http://here.you/here.you guts are spreading too much ill to our society just because you are unvaccinated or you are pushing a political narrative.  unhealthy stufffs
bmpcos me to im guardian wellbeing of my fellow country man singaporeans
bmpcos give me one example of ill
gamer studio  we are at one of the lowest in fatality rate. do you know why? you must be able to compare and contrast to appreciate.
bmpcos people muss be pressing on wrong dislike buton on all videos than - are you saying that
bmpcos  don’t like don’t read don’t be here… get lost…
"the medical team of tongji university published a paper in an english journal, healthy people will experience a series of pathological changes all over the body after being vaccinated with china's inactivated vaccine and the body's immunity declined.   the english academic journal cell discovery, co-organized by the chinese academy of sciences and the british natural publishing group (npg), published a paper by the medical team of tongji university in late october, discussing the possible effects of the chinese inactivated vaccine  side effect.   one of the important findings is that the antibodies produced by china's inactivated vaccines will basically disappear after 90 days of vaccination."
source?
i dont know about chinese vaccine much but only one thing i know for sure :chinese vaccine is far better than pfizer- but of course i prefer natural imunity
gamer studio  china can’t even produce safe milk powder for their babies. killing many of them.  now suggesting that their vaccine are safe for babies 6 months n above!??? babies have to complete a regimented mandatory vaccination program till about 18 months.  that alone is strenuous on the small body.  just don’t even go there.  no vaccine was needed with this sar2.0 it is a cash cow 🐮 for many playing on the people fear.  utter irresponsible of leaders to gambling with our lives. a drug created in 3 months not years is never a vaccine.  it is just a suppression drug n when the virus show itself. it just got far deadly. more eye wide open.
gamer studio you must be dream. here singapore. 30 workers. 27 all got covid before at domarity. never die leh. pilzer good leh. somemore positive also not sick one
"shiela tee i being coerced into taking into sinvoc, sigh. i just really dk how. i want to stay unv , just pressure by my parents"
"so in general , is sinovac better then pfizer/moderna ?"
sodding superhero  i am not here to make decision for others.  especially where parents are concern.  make a choice n you n your parents just have to live with the outcome of that choice.  i am looking for honesty from the people handling this pandemic which is lost in all the billions from these vaccines.
sodding superhero 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣。 of course not. sino is useless !!!!
sodding superhero see china govt handle today the 武汉病毒。it worst then mymar protest lockdown city.
sodding superhero https://youtu.be/_lotzd0enwihttps://youtu.be/_lotzd0enwi hope you knw chinese. messy lor
sodding superhero tell your parents. they can go china liao. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. whole city is messy. out of control
"chin ying loong i see the link , i am just pretty forced to in a sense"
sodding superhero good luck. many already experience covid and recovery. only test positive and totally not even sick with pfizer. sinovac ???? once positive. well can prepare to ask your parents to write a will. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. get the money.
"chin ying loong lol , yeah.  the odd thing is that they say their not taking anymore boasters shots and i am only to take sino twice and 2 boaster to consider as fully v for what? 4-6 months ?  is it even worth it? for a short duration then be considered unvaccinated again hmm"
"your theory about chinese vaccine does not match with reality. you should learn why indonesia covid case decline sharply starting september 2021. and now in november 2021, daily covid case per million in indonesia is far lower compare to malaysia even compare to singapore."
why did cna delete my comment? it's a known fact that our mtf task force are clowns and eu recognises that clowns run the country hahaha!
can't blame them. our gov mess it up
they also messed up bigger than us. lots of deaths there while it's okay here
bmpcos funeral parlour...
old lee  good morning. still very unsettled? hope you consider to get vaccination soon.
bmpcos germany 12year old died 2 days after taking.
bmpcos germany stopped for children currently
countries in europe are experiencing a surge right now. denmark has thousands of cases every day.
this is like a person being ostracized for unhygienic behaviour like not showering for weeks go around town and yell at every passersby that they've not showered either.
the whole world is going through a tough time owing to covid wuhan virus pandemic from china causing untold sufferings and unnecessary deaths globally especially in singapore. sad scenarios indeed.
singapore should remove denmark from vtl as well
sidney lock hahaha singapore will never dare to do that 👏👏👏
sidney lock spore only knows how to bully our own and kow tau to foreign powers
sidney lock lol i found the vaccine fomo clown!!! hows the boosters??? ready for the next one before cny next year????
"2bystander2  really, you are a xenophobic guy.its haunting you and causing you trauma. seek help 😅"
"look at the news anchor expression, he was controlling his laughter. anyway..other countries focus on infection rate , whille we look at infection growth rate lol. self deceiving"
"stop asking us to dig  nose every week dig or no dig , vaccine or no vaccine also kena 🦠 stop all this digging nonsense la. number one in the world become worst in the world 👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣"
they want to tekan all of us unvaxxinated to dig nose. to show who is the real boss here.  now some external force come and tekan them. what a relief.
but unvax like me unable to bring my special child to the centre. must dig nose till you vaccine. dig nose at your own cost.
malaya harimau who external force. better stop forcing us to vaccine
"siaw wui ng by external force, i mean .any kind of events outside the control of singapore government. like they can make thousands and one kind of vtl, but the denmark gov just cancelled whatever spore status within eu listing. vaccination from singapore becoming totally irrelevant from the denmark gov point of view. such action is tremendously encouraging to all unvaxxed people like us."
there is a difference. no vaccination means high risks or even deaths think carefully
malaya harimau like new zealand people protest 👏👏👏
i think time to raise the cost of living🤣🤣🤣🤣prosperity!  pop quiz: goat's hair cum from where? give up? answer : it cums from you!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 子曰，羊毛出在哪儿身上? 羊毛出在你身上!
i no no where to hide🤣
"when pap mafias tekan those unvaccinated people, we also feel no where to hide. no it's their turn kena tekan by external forces. karma sure come back."
malaya harimau thumbs up.
mtf is gold standard. 世界第一顶👍and i suspect world highest paid🤣
stop testing ….
test is to earn money. but test results in record?🤣
"every other country report at least 3x lower then actual report, coz in the end we had to live with this virus, but to live with this virus we need money. we need to open up to do so.."
derickmagic  well said
self humiliation at its best. give people also don't want - clearly illustrated here. well done mtf.
the situation will definitely get better and the vtl will resume as per normal. the s'pore govt has no lack of capability to do that.
d-o-g have alot of capabilities too
but heaven have other plans for them. the last 2 years have taught you…that one aspect of life.  to make god laugh tell him about all your plans.  just standby n see how the pm n his administration will put it on the people.  we always end up holding the bag in all their heist.
its the delta virus that had more capability than singapore gov.
john 5864  nice 👍
no worries.... you close doors to us it's ok..... we will still open doors to you all.... we are a friendly country. welcome to singapore.
"singapore data is fine, especially versus eu.....singapore policy making is bewildering and untethered to data.....so what are global partners meant to think?"
singapore is heading for big trouble.
eu tourist  are pobably not coming to asia for year end holidays
"big trouble ? no lah. european business leaders cannot come to singapore or vice versa ? just do more zoom meeting only. but our minister's son or daughter education in europe being disrupted or failed to graduate, wow, that's big deal. so who are more worried ? you know i know."
eu tourists love singapore.  they are not that scared like us
if i were the eu i would have done the exact same thing. seeing as how our dear government have fucked up our country because of their inability to govern properly i wouldn't blame the eu for doing what they've done.
apparently vax & unvax are not safe anymore.....please be more transparent  as to how many who left us are vax or unvax...simple request...
they are good but average deaths per million of eu is 1000 per million while our poor govt made it 50/ million  appreciation is very rare these days
fiost  pm sheep 🐑 at work again.
peter chew  transparency accountability n responsibility not traits that the pm n his administration possesses.  they are desperately holding on to their wealth created n position while in office.  so i suggest you do not hold your breath. just remain strong as their ways will be punishing the people n the domestic economy.  be prepared for more hike in our necessities as they continue to live a good life with no disruption to their paycheck n lifestyle.  we the people will always be the one paying the price for all their missteps n arrogance
shiela tee 🤣
poor little rats looking for holes to hide.hahaha damned pitiful.  low end of society.
totally agree!
we the people...haha don't include me. i very shy eh
guess pap's gamble to scapegoat the unvaxxed failed big time.
i think there’s more to it.
"of course there is more to it, from 64k cases balloon to more than 230k cases in less than 6 months."
dragon52 ..500 plus fatalities..rip ......of course my family  👪 come first...
peter chew elderly mah. why worry ? you must be the elderly right ?
more money will come here.
"more to it. of course , otherwise it means 3rd ww already.  please don't tell me how the story ends🤣"
song bo endemic but cases so high until ppl don't even want us. its like opening a shop which has failed hygiene standards a day after it was on the headlines.
not true. their deaths per million is much more. average eu country per million is 1000 while we are only 50
nice 👍👍👍 you do know where to hit where it hurts the most 😂😂😂 they deserve it!
fiost  can see you are as lazy as the pm n his administration.  just cut n paste your comment.
shiela tee  we are doing very http://well.in/well.in fact one of the most admired country in the world  you know why? our fatality rate is very low. other countries lost too many people to get this immunity.  count your blessings wastrel
fiost  only in your delusional mind.  if that helps you sleep at night. go ahead.  we have nearly 20k recovering at home. thus the spike to 5k in cases n a daily infection of 2-3k.  the delta plus variant spread like wild fire with an incubation period of just 2 days. no country will take such a risk. just one case from here will undo what they have achieved.  big picture is difficult for small minded sheep 🐑  you still stuck in the number game just like the taskforce. it is the impact n strain on the healthcare providers n resources that these countries are concern about.  it has been almost 2 years of nothingness.  we are still stuck where we are after many more vaccines flooding the market.  rather things are getting worst! that one issue need to be relook. clearly all the vaccine program not working to eradicate this virus. now the flu season is upon us.  that will be another kettle of fish which will complicate matters with covid.
"good analogy. can hide from its own citizens using big data, technology, judiciary system etc. no where to hide if it's beyond their boundary."
that’s a nice analogy…hahahaha…
"we should let people know that no country in this world is  testing like us.  big number is expected when almost everyone not working from home need to be tested at least once a week.  our death rate n icu cases isn't as good compare to our own record, but still one of the best in the world."
one of the best in the world? where did you get that from. just look at our daily cases and deaths per 100k compared to other countries. even bangladesh and india are doing much better than us now!
china's testing is so much worst than we are. when a single case is detected the entire province is primed for lockdown.
😂😂😂
e89 india is doing much better bcos they're not reporting the real numbers. calm yo tits.
"forcexjr it is a different strategy.  with our current strategy, we can't copy china formula because we shall be testing whole country everyday."
hahaha talking like 🤡🤡🤡 now every country is so scare of singapore 🇸🇬 how ?
account in sleep for 8-10years suddenly woke up to comment. gov have been planning this for at least 10years!
doubletap lii what makes you assume that? i could also assume that our gov is playing with the numbers so that they can justify hosting their bloomberg forum…
"smling11 yeah, we shouldn't. although china's cases remain low due to the measures, certain cities have already been locked down for several months. the people inside these cities are experiencing depression due to how long they've been kept inside their homes. if our country turn to these measures, the situation may get so much worse."
forcexjr lame excuses. the result speaks for itselfs.
e89 yahoo for them. you can go there now
"chin ying loong always the same argument. “not happy, leave!” nothing original. so let’s say an opposition party takes over (this is just an example), will you leave because you are not happy?"
"e89 no. it is not leave. we encourage you to ""go"". it different."
chin ying loong to go somewhere you need to leave where you are currently at
areyouone of the experts?
forcexjr and their people now very poor lor
e89 election is over. you wait 2026 lor
john 5864 you mean our country or china's?
forcexjr ; both. look at china and compare singapore
"john 5864 yeah, i guess our performance is really bad."
"chin ying loong you are changed the topic. it was just an example. but since we have moved onto the topic of elections. my personal belief is that pap should not have supermajority again, wp needs to speak up and not turn into pap b, which it looks like they are turning into. the other smaller teams need to work together. psp is doing a good job. sdp, pv and brad bowyer need to work together so that they have a bigger party as that is much better than many small parties. unfortunately since pritam became loa, i think some agreement was put in place to give him that position which basically turned wp into pap’s b team"
e89 if they can control themselves first. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. brad bowyer ? 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝.
e89 win a seat than talk. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪. or else........ no chair no usw
"chin ying loong brad bowyer comparing our gov to nazi is more accurate than you want to believe. yes, his statements may be controversial (like the nazi comparison) but most are true"
e89 nazi again ? 🤣🤣🤣. the west don't work here. not our problem.
john 5864 are you sure china ok. they almost bankcrupt.
https://youtu.be/hx8f4bmabnyhttps://youtu.be/hx8f4bmabny go china and compare.
https://youtu.be/olmmh53xhichttps://youtu.be/olmmh53xhic at least our elderly not going around beg for leftover
doubletap lii fake cert.  fake update. 😂
e89  brad bowyer? he became a skunk. all avoiding him. then they will get rid of tan chin bock. then chee soon juan will take over psp . chen shau mau will take over sdp. miss khan will form another party named anti pf. please don't tell me how the story ends 🤣🤣
e89  i forgot pv. i think the owner will name it dc party( debt collection party). and anyone who is keen to change a loan into a down payment can elect this party.  smes who want soft loans will seek this party to make them into grants( no need to pay back) isn't it great?🤣🤣
doubletap lii most of the hospitals have shut down their covid wards. the same in indonesia.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
exactly 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
two clowns spotted
"so what's the next step ? take a look at all those vtl. what is the underlying conditions that can sustain its implementation convincingly.? a vaçcine that really perform like a vaccine, okay ! not an experimental drug that's proven to be leaky, ineffective over time and harmful."
now denmark need singaporean to quarintine
the rest of eu nations will follow suite
who go there ? for what ?
no big issue .it will be changed soon.
https://youtu.be/vg2pdsoztowhttps://youtu.be/vg2pdsoztow safe and effective
"although singapore has done really well on many fronts during this pandemic, they've clearly faltered in many areas, including not establishing a vtl with countries like india where cases per 100k is way below singapore and instead opening its borders with vtl for countries like us and uk where the numbers continue to remain ridiculously high putting economic interests first and with absolutely no regard or respect to migrant lives in the process. hope singapore does not pay a high price for such really bad decisions after decades of hard work which has contributed to its growth. the world is watching singapore closely"
let's go brandon!
no test no case. other country cases is low so you think they are safe? no. that is because they dont test their people. lol.
done well in many front??? 🤣🤣🤣  the only front is the frontliners trying not to lose their minds due to exhaustion.  the only front are the people of singapore trying to keep up with all the idiotic n nonsensical covid restrictions by the politician filled taskforce. you still hung up with the number game.  the latest variant is delta plus. we imported 1 n that is enough to do us in.  that is the one they shared. we are still importing covid cases daily. they never seem to learn after the changi cluster that kill a 80year old cleaner. thus that 5k surge which min wong is trying to investigate with their mice events. don’t worry he will come up with some mountain folktale again to excuse explain themselves away.  this new variant spread like wild fire with an incubation period of only 2 days.  look at the data that is out daily.  the highest infection group are the young adult age 20-50 plus. these are the people who are mostly vaccinated yet getting invested left right centre.  they are also the ones infecting the elderly in their family.  this is confession of many elderly who survive covid. they got it from their children. so get off your high horse n see what happening on the ground.  just don’t comment without thinking.
very talkative 🤣🤣🤣
"don't worry, singapore has many complain kings who will blame after something bad happens, not before  . . ."
now our covid numbers are so high even eu is scared! well done on your theory of living with covid mtf!
take a sit mate lol everyone is living with it. we can't live the zero tolerance policy like china.  not like singapore is banned forever... gessh
"unless it gets high enough, it will never get lower and we will be stuck in permanent circuit breaker and closed border. better to let the cases rise. countries which close border to singaporeans now will open eventually anyway, like singapore itself opened to india, us etc."
let's go brandon!
2000plus cases 8 didn't  make it..new normal....
eu's death per million is 1000/ million people  we are at 50/ million people who is doing better? a sea of useless whiners
lets go hsien loong!
"livelihoods matter. ever wonder how 18 million people are living below poverty line in modern usa, the greatest country on earth? 16 million food stamps? living in the streets, cars and shelters for years and years? here you kpkb every day against the govt. open your eyes and see."
expected.

"first hope with this happening, more flights open and sia and other companies hire back their air stewardess who loose their job. and, above lal, ok, with the amount of beds ready we are in comfortable position to tackle this but, as a person who live with chronic parents both at very old age, of course i'm paranoid and avoiding crowd places. so...... yeah. just stay safe and hope this will open up more jobs that are closed."
"how accurate is the pcr test? following real story speaks it all. turkish man muzaffer kayasan may hold the record for the longest period of infection for any covid-19 patient, reported daily sabah. the 56-year-old has tested positive for the deadly disease 78 times since 2020 and is seeking a way out of his situation, which has confined him to his home and hospitals for a total of 14 months."
dam canyousend us his facebook acc so we can ask him personally tq
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere the world. god bless singapore.
u crazy lol
"gladiatorgamer you're not loyal to your country enough. you should be stripped of your singaporean citizenship, my friend. if you want respect from your government, respect them first. i ain't even a singaporean, btw."
elon musk areyouamerican cuz ifyouareyoujust shut up
simple. they trying to achieve herd immunity.
die die need to hit the 30k covid-19 target lah.  let's be patient.
"again, the obsession with the vaccines."
means don’t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
soon no vaccines mandate.
basically forced an experimental therapy on people whilst promising freedom but then ends up with no freedom anyway lol
stop all your stupid drama and open up the bloody causeway first.
"hahahahahhah, nothing has changed  🤣"
now so many cases still open more and let in more.somemore healthy visitors🤣🤣🤣.soyoumean past few months all not healthy la no wonder cases up so high.allyousay la.want money just say la
all you concern about is your economic
"with 5m population, the 19,000 daily cases is equivalent to 4.5m in china 1.3b and it is crazy dangerous.  many vulnerable folks will die.  those in icu are likely kept breathing with machines and deaths are scheduled gradually to avoid public alarm.  goh ct tony tan and gang are old and covid will likely kill them soon as the spread explodes."
"there will prolly be a next wave, best thing to do is to name it ongyecron."
bo pian la how long want to hide one corner
i think i should continue to wear mask just in case if another virus season comes along
if people ask just say your religion is covid lol
terry andrews perfect. their new church is the hospital. anthony fauci is their church leader.
hang tuah hastinapura and before entering any place they have to lift up their mobile phone and scan.
terry andrews sounds to me like a hopelessly lifeless automaton. don't count on me 😂
"one after another, countries around the world begin to roll back the covid mandates in their countries, even israel has to give up its hope in medicines to roll back its covid mandates including the quarantine for tourists. except very few contries like those totalitarian societies china, nk, or us or few others, people break down the self isolation to welcome tourists without bothering ask tourists any covid related  questions like vaccination or checking temperature..."
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
window of opportunity.
so basically nothing has changed
stinkapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may (no masks & no safeentry check in) since uk has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in us the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination 🥳 and this is called political science 🤓 not science 🤣
neocov
so if social distancing then don’t need mask ah?
maybe they should start testing peoples spitting whilst talking distance
hopefully other asian countries will follow singapore 🇸🇬 they leading the way in asia.
hopefully no countries in the world will lead this orwellian bs we live thru in the recent years
start fixing your opposition parties then.
what a fool indeed. pied piper leading the lemmings to the river and get drowned.
"yeah, i can return without quarantine!"
aren'tyouin singapore
what's mean vtl ? 😷☣
👍👍kudos to the capable s'pore govt.
"kudos to the govt, soon there will be no mask mandate for tourist/ visitors. despite  increasing covid cases and deaths, the govt decides to ease covid measures instead of mitigating the covid situation. it's clear that the govt does not want to lose out on global travel rebounds so increase fatality is acceptable collateral damage."
it's follow the leader. lol
tf is non-mandatory safe distancing
most vtl are people who want to return to their homeland like malaysian
"3000 people in an event.  at this time, to me that's bad news in terms of the virus spread but people who are vaccinated are in much better shape.   n95s are in pretty good supply now in certain countries, and that helps greatly, too."
hi i am from bangladesh... i can meet u... please send your facebook id
"steven, just don't come back to infect your fellow men."
"steven, please do a vtl video from melbourne to kuala lumpur, pretty please? thank you so much! :)"
cna is singapore channel.
you should have done the vtl travel process to south korea anyway.. i cant find any such video on youtube yet
how is travelling on a vtl different than normal? what are the pros and cons of travelling via vtl?
it's interesting how both the art and pcr are significantly more expensive in singapore than in germany.. any possibility to dig into explaining what goes into the difference in test costs for singapore vs germany?
greedy people want to make money
"seriously if you travel on holiday during a pandemic, you really need to have your head examined !!!"
"pcr test, 💵💵💵"
please stop all this ..
"selling sia or promoting it,now bcos it heavily indebted.but not our live into it and be fool by it.sorry be honest with http://ourselves.is/ourselves.is it worth it? what if cannot and will not be able to fly back and got stuck in the air,that is the end of it.too late by than."
"first of all,  thank you steven and cna for doing the german vtl video.   it's so informative and i used it as my reference prior to traveling to germany and belgium recently.  the germans  are truly living with covid.   they know when and where to wear masks, and they don't have to rely on government fines to do so.    the shopping areas are flooded with tourists and visitors.  restaurants are all crowded.   business is booming.   there are a lot to learn from them.  yes,  please do a travel series!   i am planning to visit korea next.... hope to see steven on the same flight!"
anyone from australia for any purpose can come to singapore. but not the other way round. why? singapore low class? so hard up meh? unequal agreement also accept. not just australia. so many countries can suka suka come to singapore. but not vice-versa.
"with all the hassles, uncertainties of tests, and additional costs, it's not worth traveling abroad at the moment. i'd rather travel within my own country in malaysia and still enjoy the nature, sun, and beaches."
"every time he comes on screen, i'll switch channel."
me too
https://youtu.be/__xbdzhkm7khttps://youtu.be/__xbdzhkm7k
he should watch bayern game instead of ice hockey
"main issue is unpredictability for working adults who have to book leave with their employers. if you require quarantine prior to return flight to singapore (you tested positive before your flight back), not many employers will be too pleased with your absence since you would not be arriving back in singapore as planned, regardless of whether you had any control over situation."
i want a job
is it true that only flying sq can get quarantine free?
"nope...that's not true. vtl flights are available on other airlines too, it depends on the country"
steven chia 👍🏻👏🏻confusing info from everyone. thanks for clarification
what happens if you are unvaccinated? are we still allowed to book tickets on singapore airlines?
"starlite 77 yes, you can. but you may have to serve quarantine in the country you visit. only those on vtl flights don't have to serve quarantine but they must be vaccinated"
ychong ong sq and lufthansa are the only two airlines offering vtl flights from germany.
steven chia hey steven... do a vtl report on sq’s inaugural nonstop flight to vancouver lah!
"if vtl is a bad idea, your trip says it all."
go to south korea pls!! would like to know how to process is there for vtl.
the days of budget travel are officially over. enough said.
<b>are you aware germany will label singapore as high risk to travel country effectively on oct 24?  so where does this vtl heading to next before in no time more labelling will take effect?</b>
yep
"this doesn't affect the vtl as the lane is for arrivals into singapore only.  as for entry to germany, as of oct 23, fully vaccinated travellers from singapore can still enter germany without serving quarantine,though there are restrictions for young children. read more here https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/germany-singapore-vtl-high-risk-country-alert-travel-2263952https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/germany-singapore-vtl-high-risk-country-alert-travel-2263952?"
cna insider great clarification and next hope cna can do another documentary on vtl to other asian countries like india pakistan brunei taiwan hk or china and show more footage on how steve explore several tourist attractions and find opportunity to locate and interview singaporeans who was visiting these countries at that time.
what about unvaccinated passengers are we still allowed to board singapore airlines ? what are the ramifications for the unvaxxed?
starlite 77 am unsure if unvaccinated can travel to ubin ?
why is the art in germany only cost 1 to 1.5 euros. singapore cost ard 10 sing dollars. why why why.. government pls do something about this. i don't need you to give me free. i need you to bring the cost down so i can buy myself.
"cos they produce locally? i checked with my friend in us, costs around s$9.50 per kit in us too."
yes it's definitely worth aside from small hassle such as pcr testing or 7/8 days testing at your own expenses please do south korea for vtl! cause we are in the midst of finalizing the plans to travel in jan/feb 2022
"ha ha...sorry, afraid you'll have to do your own research! 😆"
and australia please steve
"if you get used to the art and pcr tests, most likely you 成龙了."
singapore should keep their house clean first. can you imagine inviting your friends to your messy and dirty house... that is so embarrassing!!!! i am sure others won't want to invite throw friends if they didn't clean up too.
"where’d you get these bags from? these purses are perfect, need one asap!!!! and the bag  http://xrepbag.com/xrepbag.com  is so freakin cute. its totally worth the wait!about:invalid#zcsafez"
he needs to be updated. ha ha ha!
"still seems like somewhat of a hassle,  and so many variables."
indeed its just too mind boggling and depressing and in fact humiliating to go through all these health screening regimes so no thanks for vtl for leisure ever.
boba fett so it's not mandatory to get vaccinated to fly on singapore?
starlite 77 no vaccination no fly just like no money no talk 😁
"covid-vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine-sulfate. covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated. peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak."
ceca variants
thank you this was very informative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygpmmlofizo&t=6m40s6:40 - and pcr is really not necessary for vaccinated folks. art will do actually.
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygpmmlofizo&t=3m20s3:20 only foolish vaccinated folks in some countries are wearing masks outdoors, not the other way around..."
are you immune like the rest of the politicians?
covid is a scam. deal with with.

"grab singapore stopped all rostered routine art testing  dear delivery partner,  please note that the last day of qtc testing would be today, 17 february. given recent changes to rostered routine testing (rrt) all appointments from 18 february onwards would be automatically cancelled as fdrs will no longer have to undergo rrt from 18 february onwards. riders are advised that they will not be receiving any cancellation notifications.  this is per moh's press release on 16 february 2022, rrt would be streamlined to only focus on settings interacting with vulnerable groups and selected essential services sectors from 18 february 2022.  ....... we still strongly encourage delivery-partners to stay vigilant, do regular self testing and visit doctor when feeling unwell."
mr x angmo boss very happy. no more rrt. thought he won. hope he contract covid n up lorry soon.
systems are looking nonsensical as this plandemic prolonged..
"ever since the start of the global vaccine rollout in january 2021, some experts have been crying out against mass and rapid vaccination of populations in the midst of a raging pandemic. if they are right, this will go on creating more variants and prolonging the pandemic. so far, it is looking like it, and god help us! thank you cna for this report and with this song of hope i pray for god's swift intervention to end this pandemic: https://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbghttps://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbg"
"you ministers messed up big time. numerous restrictions on malaysians where risk level is low to medium. but you opened the floodgates for the indians to come in and now 20,000 cases daily."
"the more cases, life and travel will go back to normal sooner. or else, singapore will end up like hong kong. lee hsien loong is no curry lamb."
the imperfect perfectionist can you compensate the suffering and death of singaporeans.
"gurmit singh no, i am not responsible to compensate for random people's lives. a modicum of reality should tell that to anyone."
your rm is highly flawed.
"dear ministers, your decisions and policies have failed and caused so much grief to singaporeans. never listened to me."
"until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them, this drama will continue. the disease isn't that severe as projected by the media. they are trying to create the social credit system by fooling the people in name of covid. social credit system is the ultimate slavery. every person will be assigned credits. people with low credits will be refused access to shops, malls.. etc. you see.. in emerging set up where people are granted access based on vaccine status,  they will soon replace the vaccine status with credits. so basically if a politician wants to commit atrocity and you oppose it. he can easily isolate you from the society by lowering your credits. imagine the power that you are handing over to the politicians because of your stupidity. still think it's all about the virus??? 🤦"
oh so not for citizens but foreigners...
what about outgoing travellers?
our present government can do whatever they like. even when they are voted out they still can take up jobs in the government policy making job. the choice of the citizen is not taken into consideration at all. democratic of one man one vote to get the appropriate person to represent us is taken lightly.
"whatever, anyway viruses have everywhere since we are born to this world just because of politics and business make it life more difficult just take care of our families good and safe our lives by our own way should be ok"
this govt simply wants everyone of us to get covid. its disrupting our work and health for goodness
can we torlerate these rubbish anymore.

"it all depends on what restrictions other countries have. singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia (among others) did, too. it creates a competition for tourist dollars,  investments etc. basically, opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others, triggering a virtuous cycle. it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions. if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements, then singapore will likely follow too."

the case numbers don't matter anymore considering omicron is the most mild of all the variants. deaths from omicron are rare and it's treated as a common cold unless you are the singapore government are nothing but cowards.
"just a champion crushing your dream actually it might turn out that omicron has not mellow down but appear to seem so due to vaccination n natural immunity from past infection as they both appeared to hv almost the same strength in clinical data from us, europe n israel."

opening up brings in more tourist dollars what does the easing of restrictions bring in?

"good thing. the more we open up, less will be the incentive of closing border. as he clearly said, when community cases rise, closing border losses its effectiveness. that is what we need to break out of restrictions and travel bans."

isn't our daily local counts infected by the imports.....?
so what? what's the point of living when you have to worry abt making ends meet! and the worst part? the likelihood of dying from covid 19 if you are jabbed is super low! so why worry? the tourist dollars however makes a huge difference to our hawkers and our people. dont be selfish
no
local import local case local go other country vtl jalan jalan get the covid then come singapore invest covid
in the other news singapore month of jan '22 average imported omicron cases is 200-600 daily cases. source : st/moh

p fixer vaccine after 2nd dose finish .how many day after we can take booster
so just because omicron isn't deadly we can just take any risk is that it... it is deadly or not a virus is a virus don't look down on it just because it isn't deadly....we are dealing with a live virus that can update itself and evolve and making it deadly don't wait until it strikes then you wanna take action then it's already too late don't you guys ever learn from anything you don't take virus lightly clearly any of you ever know about the virus so lame
"who, eu, south korea and australia already approved novavax. how long do we have to wait for singapore's approval so that unvaccinated can ease national's protection and won't further burden national's medical system?"
their responses are sensible 👌
show your vaccine put stickers on your shirt that all . a this to improve the virus 🦠.
is it really true dat omicron is less severe...too early to conclude?
hbl for students  is more safe because  this virus attack young people's  more

in the first place stop opening up the borders and let it stabilize. from the first one to delta to omicron. poor people with sinus issues or asthmatic patients don't even dare visit a clinic. shopping malls crowding with people that feels like they havent been out in eons. the precaution on the news isn't what we need. the precaution on the ground daily is what we need

prevention is better than cure!  haven't you learnt!
"again big  trouble ahead. when will the authorities understand that the surge of omicron and also new variant in the world is not the result of nonvaccinated (5% -15%) as the variants are  new and recent ones. further only vaccinated ppl are able to travel overseas to south africa and other places where they were contaminated before returning back to contaminate others. the surge to covid and omicron is due to nonefficacity of one of the sanitary measures, which cannot prevent the variant from entering our body. the authorities are hence responsible for these crisis and they don't care and are endangering the life of all these people, police included and their families mainly with the variant omicron prevailing as an air borne virus. the solution is to use essential oil eg amla oil to be rub regularly on hands, forearms and face and face masked and proper washing as the virus/variant is inert in such medium and is not able to enter our body. already 6 millions of deaths since 2 years. the authorities and those holding power on covid  have to change strategy with above deus abençoe"
open vtl lane for atleast two weeks to book flights tickets i request you

the omicron variant is the simple common flu categorized as sarscov 229e in tests done. pushing fear to a new level are we prepared to offer our children too as experimental subjects just for the sake of political correctness. are we unwitingly in conflict with the nuremberg codes?
close the virus transmission lane !!!!! why vaccinated  still carry virus !!!!
china spread the viruses and whole world suffering
gjw !
in the case open up the border jus make people flow up and down i really do not understand the end of the day 😔🤯😣😞🥺🇸🇬🇸🇬 why always is this way??!!!
"what are you talking about tightening, it's not supposed to have one in the first place, whoever plan or got handsome bonuseswhich i believes really happens,  should be fired and make to pay back all the bonuses that he or she got and gives to the victims of the omicron that is still in the hospitals...!!!!!!!!!!!"

just look at those three faces .. looooooook hard !!!! looooooooook !!!!!!! now take a deep breath - exhale.  what’s your verdict ?
why is it that there are so many imported covid cases daily? is the authority of singapore doing anything to review the vtl?
"yes,but please stop the vtl so we won't spread this omicron which will effect singaporeans."
"close borders forever? hmm, your country will be poorer than any of your neighbours … maybe wanna have a talk with someone in africa still waiting for their vaccine? government is doing what they should be doing! always complain complain… you wanna be a politician right now? us peasants always think we know better!"

blaming the unvax is a sin.

it's milder
not our problem if they look haggard🙄.

you won’t get blue skin!

old lee actually i have turned into a smurf sorry mrna gives you blue skin but i don’t mind i like being a comic figurine call me smurfette
eva so wats the benefits of the vaccine?
"old lee i understand why you are frustrated but you really need to do the right research - of course you get covid if you are vaccinated we will all get it in our life time even a few times maybe … but statistics prove the chances are hugely lower that you end up in icu … if you vaccinated … we have come so far in medicine , mrna is revolutionary in future it might even heal cancer … it’s not all bad have faith in science … but it’s been two years with covid anti vaxxers don’t change their minds anymore …"
eva but i never see any data about it and i got heart clamp after second jab. very dangerous for me. nobody can tell me what the benefits of the vaccine. i nearly died even before i contact covic after 2jab.
lol lawrence sounds fustrated.. what a failure of a minister!
let him. not our problem.

thumbs up to the decisions made during the press conference.
thumbs up 👍
from mmtf clowns’ response on tv yesterday.. they are only concerned about $$$ and “protecting singapore’s hubs reputation”.. they even blamed singaporean locals now when they knowingly allowed vtls/non-vtls infected travellers(remember infected ceca travellers) to infect our local commmunities..blaming omicron already exists in our local communities and locals’ complacency(clark quay new year  party)..these clowns are finding excuses/reasons to let in infected travellers into singapore and telling singaporeans to accept “living with covid19” !
"they do need someone to take blame and it just happen that local singaporean ""are"" the easiest ""target"" cos they know we can't do anything to them . and many still either sleeping or still believe in all the fairytale they said . it just a sad thing"
these ministers slow not up to date now got another new variant (ihu) in france 🇫🇷 so he warn you’ll got a superwave coming i also can warn you’ll a few things: social control (mandates) 5g digital currency another plandemic  getting chipped one world government

what is your plan?
why we have to plan for them? they are earning millions. we were told they are elites!
bmpcos close border bodoh!
"avenue five  who is earning millions? your grandfather? if you have no plans, then leave to those who have. just zip up your gap hole and let them lead."
"saifuddin said  i understand your concerns and i agree with you. we should only allow citizens to come home but others like pass holders should not be allowed to come.  when govt opened borders, there were less toxic comments online but once we closed borders and stopped the vtl , waaa, you’ll see the most vicious and spiteful comments coming from foreigners, esp those from the north, all just wanting to use singapore as a haven to escape from their own miserable conditions back in their own homeland. on the other hand, citizens want government to close up everything..."
bell1980are you stupid or i'm stupid! my grandfather told me if no millions dollar salary cannot attract top talents to be minister. i watch news and read st everyday.
"avenue five , i will pay you the same amount if you have a draft. not even a plan. do you have one? nooooo you are empty (above your shoulders).  go get your mom to wipe your behind and learn to make your bed before you rush out to save the world. superheroes do that kid."

it's no longer a can of worms but a field of rats.
""" do not equate omicron with the common cold. although early data suggests omicron may be less virulent than earlier variants, this is still a potentially lethal virus. and even so-called 'mild' infections can be pretty miserable.""  those at highest risk for developing severe disease or a bad outcome from omicron include the un-vaccinated, the immunocompromised, pregnant women, seniors and those with significant underlying disease, especially if not  boosted. people tend to be concerned primarily with the immediate consequences of  covid-19 (mild disease versus hospitalization and death). ""however, it is clear that 'long covid' can be very problematic in carrying on with the daily activities of living, therefore, the best strategy is to not get infected."" - - university at buffalo, us"
is these what we call speedy respond. these is what we are paying for. when we started the vtl the omicron is already spreading like fire. but we still as cool as cucumber!
"our ministers looked tired & very uptight. they tried a ""narrow"" prepared  ""explanation"" pre agreed amongst themselves that did not bring ""confidence"" as a lot of things are not answered. perhaps, it's not the right time to be committing to an immediate future scenario. we open, us, brunei, etc close on us, & our ""omicron"" visitors still come to reside big time, which in turn gives the reason more countries to close on us, isn't right. somehow, i fear for more of our old, both vax & unvax with existing ailments. when one gets old, who hasn't compromising ailments. living/dying with virus is such a pain. hope our government can come up with something better. something from the much talked of ""out of the box"". singapore needs & deserves better."
can you suggest something better? they are human beings. are you being fair in your comment?
like what they mention.. they are not tightening border.. we have to start living with the virus.. govt are not bothered abt us already
bmpcos we pay top dollar we expect top performance.
"bmpcos yes. i can suggest something better. i have suggested so. i would never ""open"" like in aug 21, causing so much deaths. singapore lives are not percentage numbers. singapore lives are ours as all singaporeans to protect. that's for starters. economy? opening up for omicron & other variants, while spread numbers curtail opening up with ban from close allies like us, brunei, etc is sane public policies? hey. try your ""better"" on someone else. i am fully prepared to do better. i will not succumb to ""experts"" advice. a elected needs more. logic in roll out and bringing to practicalities to my electorate is 80+% more than ""experts"" can provide. this is the direct ""failings"" of policies. i am not part of this ""governing"" mess. opposition equally if not more lost. i am sure lky with his chosen team realized the basics flaws would have made everything better. i missed him very much at such times. ""singapore lives as a"" sacrificial"" % is never right""."
saifuddin said we cannot be doing a western policy that will fail. how can we live (die) with a virus that is changing? we cannot live with something we don't know about. simple commonsense. this is the root flaw in this promotion.
weikwang lee  so how? cannot live with something you don't know?
"bmpcos use your brains. don't let it come in with open welcome and say it is inevitable for starters. there is a strategic difference between living by free flow & not living by control. do your own maths. i am not part of this mess. i am in this environment, i use my efforts to try to avoid things coming. you think with mass positives, all our services will not be overwhelmed? singapore ready for this? positives still allowed to work to spread more like our health services? reported 32 mutations. now 37. hey. you think health people are cautious enough? i am running this show. my role is avoiding logical pitfalls via administrative environments to try to stay safe."
"bmpcos humans? fair? after the way they treat the marginalised? now playing victim, they expect sympathy??😡"
"bmpcos why bother suggest, how about yoi yourself talk to their face. you seems to be an intellectual with high level of confidence."

import la import somemore.... then later place more restrictions on us poor citizens cos of foreigners.... singaporereans always get punished bc of foreigners

is it the problem now vtl or people in clarke quay celebrating with no mask and safe distancing?  i think we all  know the answer.
do you think clark quay.. do take a look in shopping also..not just that location..everywhere is unable to control..
no problem lah. cases are under control. our hospitals are doing okay

well said 👍
"when the wuhan virus emerged,  everyone and you know ""who"" played it down. who were the experts?   it's just like the common cold they said  while people died in the thousands. now, omicron is really like the common cold, and everyone is terrified. again ""who"" are the experts?  it's like the top financial gurus who can't really predict a recession.  they're not all clever and we're not all stupid.  just watch. the first countries to recover and progress will be the ones where there now millions of omicron cases each day. the usa had a million infections today.  the ones who want to run the so called ""tight ships"" will recover last. china cannot fight omicron even with iron man in charge. nature is teaching us to be humble.  learn or perish"
"v soon singapore will have thousands of omicorn cases like previous delta cases. are we supposed to accept that as normal again n treat it like catching cold ? who will want to come to singapore then, even thru vtl n local people will also afraid to go mall etc"

vetted questions.
"in an event if we have 10,000 omicrons daily who would want to come to singapore eventually..?"
"everyone of us will be infected anyway, new variant will keep coming until our bodies get use to it, what’s the difference be it 10million cases or 10000cases? since it’s not deadly, get it early for a natural immune is better then anything"
"philz3ro 10 billions dont matter. but if ure that 1 out of a billion who actually lost a loved one, it matters. agree?"
shadostorm there is so many types of illness and different types of death that is more dangerous then covid that will affect everyone. hope this will give you some clue
"why is g continuing to restrict singaporeans activities for fear of covid, when it keeps importing new unquarantined tourists with open legs?"
"because it's only a matter of time before singapore has a higher case rate than the countries you want to keep out. closed borders did not keep out delta either. what are we to do, ban imports and live off all the farmland we have here?"
lol exactly... they need theircpussy fix!
they dont care anymore. only money
"we cannot be closed, can we? livelihoods are important.  nobody owes us a living"
"bmpcos yeah but who suffers more, the people coming in to infect us or people that stay here for years and years. at some point repeating cliches like ""nobody owes us a living"" has to be put in its rightful context! stop using it without realising the people who say it have their own selfish hidden greedy agenda!!! this is not a private company, this is a country! we survived british colonisation japanese occupation and world war 2!!! we get to have  a say too!"
jillybean jillybean  do you know spore's main income sources? natural resources ? do we have? are you willing to sacrifice all our advantages as a hub to live as if we would survive without being able to earn income from the world by being relevant and useful? why would the world use us?  does locking ourselves up good for the future of spore?
"bmpcos lets agree to disagree, you worship money, your god is the god of wealth. my god is the holy trinity. so we see things differently. there are some things that are non negotiable. there are some ideals and principles in life worth hanging on to. did i say cloister up for decades??!!! did i...i did not but you presumed it! so that is your presumption."
jillybean jillybean  i guess the way to follow is based on the will of the majority. we are a democracy afterall. no policy will please everyone.  let's be realistic and uphold our democracy.
"bmpcos what democracy??? singapore is not democracy when one party is given full mandate.  what is the result of the vtl. i dont see they have succeeded . instead have cause spike in cases , risking singaporean lives and making it more difficult with prolong restriction."
bmpcos you keep brown nosing and see where that gets you. i have my own mind and my own brains i am not you you are not me. accept that fact!
"jillybean jillybean a suggestion. if you want to spite the authorities with profanities, you must be prepared for some comment by others.  learn this and i am sure you will find more peace."
bmpcos so now you are a pap minion? how much do they pay you to troll on youtybe?
bmpcos if you can read english you will know i never used any profanities...poor you...did you fail psle or  olevels and now you need a 20 dollar an hour job working for the pappies trolls?
jillybean jillybean  who says they need their cpussy fixed? holy one....🤣
bmpcos i say because i know things you do not
jillybean jillybeando you own one?
jillybean jillybean . hypocrite.
"bmpcos get a life and stop trying to be my friend, i have loads, you have none, now get lost and stay lost. this is harassment! i will report you to the police, troll!"
jillybean jillybean  who wants to be your friend? get lost troll
"bmpcos i have reported you to youtube  you are the troll not me, stop harassing me sexually asking me if i own a pussy! it is sexual harrassment and illegal! you are offensive and you do not belong here!"
jillybean jillybean  you are the one using such words against the authorities.  and i don't even know your gender. it's a fair question.
"jillybean jillybean  you are plain bad. you started using such word, not me. what's make you think that you are entitled to use such word against the authorities? hypocrite"
"bmpcos i would rather go back to living like we were in the 60s, we don't need these comforts. i would rather live simple and be free"
pulau64 imports? he is talking about 'unquarantined tourists' and he has a point. we should tighten border controls further. we already did that with suspending the sales of tickets to and from jb. we didn't keep those open and say 'its only a matter of time before singapore...' .
tourists bring new money. sinkies like you just ask for handouts and grants.
yōkai 369 where are the tourist???? instead the policies causes spike and restriction. risking singaporean lives and businesses. instead tourist are afraid to come. handout???? or rather increase the cost of living by taxing the people. you forget gst is going up too.
pls resume vtl soon… was looking forward to visit istanbul or korea…i want to clear my leave before expire….given up hope to visit japan this year…they don’t need tourism
moh's credibility is waning faster than the vaccine efficacy
i am very happy with their performance. great job
singaporeans are losing confidence at the mtf
the current administration never had credibility in the first place.
taeyeonist - true
get your vaccination please and do us a favour.
not a bit.  they had done a great job👍👍👍
"justfair if your vaccination works, why so scared?"
tan gina great job at being global laughing stocks 😂
"tan gina hi, has your period gone haywire after your jab? thats because the mrna resides in your ovaries the most while producing spike proteins for your antibodies to attack. i'm afraid your eggs are already affected. if you are already in menopause, beware of ovarian cancer. good luck, stay safe"
garen where did you get your info from?
"taeyeonist - , like who cares what you whine."
"taeyeonist - , doesn’t matter if vaccination work on others. you the recalcitrant unvaccinated being punish is what makes everyone happy. it is truly delightful to see your tribe suffer. good job g."
"garen , first learn to wipe your behind before you save the world kid."
"ck lee hi, if you experience symptoms of headache after your vaccine, the spike protein prions have most likely made it pass your blood brain barrier, setting you up for prion diseases in the future. if you lost your sense of smell during this period, your risk of parkinson's diseases increases. good luck in your next injection and stay safe"
"garen , something else. you know about the vaccine differentiation? is it affecting you?  just my personal opinion: i wish it had come earlier.  why? just to punish you. the harder the happier i will be."
"ck lee hi, if you find your blood pressure increases after your injection, its due to endothelial inflammation of your vascular system. endothelial cells provide a smooth lining inside your blood vessels for smooth blood flow but due to circulating spike proteins causing damage to those linings, they are no longer smooth and thus your blood flow is irregular. these tissue scars are permanent. its better to see a doctor if you have persistent high blood pressure and fast heartbeat for more than 2 weeks. good luck, stay safe"
"garen when you have nothing nice to say, don’t say."
"garen  , what is your medical basis? you are not even a nurse.  did you made your bed this morning kid?"
"garen , btw, your torturous effort to control your anger at me is seriously damaging your already infected liver as shown by the continuous hallucinations you are feeling every second. you don’t have to seek any more belated help. rest well."
"ck lee i believe you describing your own unhinged anger towards yourself and towards everyone around you. the irrational fear you have towards unvaccinated is due to the doubts of your booster efficacy. try mindful meditation. it might not work to relive those side effects i mentioned earlier but its the least you can do right now. good luck, stay safe"
"garen , lol. am i causing all your involuntary and incoherent knee jerk responses? those are understandable side effects of infected patients. i have no advice for the condemned.  i happen to be living healthily so thank you for your well wishes.  in case you couldn’t sleep due to covid, i will be happy to let you entertain me through the night. don’t let me wait."
"​ck lee hmm not really, i had a really good sleep. my previous statements are made to help you get a grasp of whats happening to your body after your injection. you are being poisoned without realising it.   ""no advice for the condemned?"" that's the kind of statements one would made under irrational fear. in fact let me hear more of your unhinged responses."
"garen , yes you would know. ready for another new day of enlightenment?"
"garen , what is your fear boy? honestly what are you drifting by? what is your medical basis? why do you rattle away tangentially in your open mind? do tell me your nightmares."
"garen , i see why you have anxiety attacks that kept you awake every night. you need help with your mind. it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. what you see in the world is what you see in yourself."
"ck lee hmm you gave me 3 responses.  the first response is mediocre.  the second response is still not your best unhinged version yet. i think you can let yourself loose and go full on deranged. work on this the third response is a repeat of your second response which is more of your anxieties and nightmares again? its getting abit incoherent when you get into the abstract stuffs like curses, world, etc. stick with the second response   so lets work on your second response. let yourself really go off this time. i want the full unhinged anger version. i know you can do it, you just need to dig deep within yourself"
"garen , sure let’s go. why do you keep blaming the pap for the virus impact? why do you blame the government for your twisted misinformation of the vaccine. why do you blame others for you own infection. why do you blame the world for being a poor loser? it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. what you see in the world is what you see in yourself. what lessons you haven’t learn will be repeated lol."
"​ck lee is that it?  this is your most unhinged version? quite disappointed really.. come on, we need to get you worked up towards a cerebral infarction. your latest response is weaker than all your previous ones. put more anger, outbursts and more irrational fear into your statements"
garen  really? i am curious. i am listening. please tell me more about your vaccines believes. i am interested to know.
"garen , is that it? i am waiting. please don’t escape."
"​ck lee good! now i have got you interested, lets start with fda shall we? did you know that fda has requested 75 years before disclosing the pfizer trial data that was used to grant full fda approval? fda is supposed to release it last year but is refusing to do until 75 years later. are you interested to know why?"
"ck lee tsk tsk tsk, it seems that you are extremely unhappy that you took the vaccine. for someone who took a 'cure', you really seem grumpy and angry. wishing ill on others? be careful there. look at yam keng and take heed."
"garen , no i am not."
"sig ma , well so say you."
ck lee remember. take heed. don't wish ill on others. we are all in this together.
sig ma   what track are you on? do you know what was discussed? no one is wishing anyone unwell. it is only fair to stop the unvaccinated from hurting the rest of the population. your opinions (and anyone else) ain’t worth sh**t. the unvaccinated is getting punished as deserved hallelujah. period.
"garen , rofl why? really why? tell me you have the proof (not from your dreams) please."
"​ck lee good! you are getting more unhinged the more we talk. i see you are attacking everyone who comments here the reason is because a regional director who was employed at the research organisation ventavia research group has told the bmj that pfizer company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in pfizer’s pivotal phase iii trial.  staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. after repeatedly notifying ventavia of these problems, the regional director, brook jackson, emailed a complaint to the us food and drug administration (fda). but fda ignored the emailed and now they want to bury the data for 75 years  . are you interested to know more about one of the children seriously affected in that pfizer trial?"
ck lee the unvaccinated are not hurting the rest of the population. they do not deserve to get punished. there is no scientific basis for discriminating the unvaccinated.
"sig ma , claiming the unvaccinated doesn’t cause infection is your freedom and your right. punishing them is the law. so it doesn’t matter what you claim. you will be punish heavier and heavier as long as the endemic is here. go change that. it is not me you must convince."
"garen , you know the staff involved and read all the documents you claimed? no? as expected."
​ck lee and do you know the staffs involved and read all the documents  moh claimed to be facts?
"garen ,  i don’t that is why i did not state it. you stated it so you must have proofs to show. it is fine if you can’t show it in the next two replies. we accommodate defects."
"sig ma , do you need to consult garen to help with your speechlessness?"
"ck lee i've shown you the information and you just don't bother to read up. can't help you if you are lazy the more you reply, the more likes my original comments gets :) thanks for keeping this track alive. my real intention is to show your atrocious behaviour to the public and seems like its working :)"
"garen , where are the info you pretend to fake. i don’t see even an article or a link. yes a link like this, i am happy to keep alive for other to see what a fake mental job you are. you are welcome. i will be here whenever you are."
"garen ,  one other thing. you can claim all your rights and freedom to be unvaccinated but the law punish people like you. so show me you are above all laws. what can you change with your loud mouth?"
"garen , see eventually you can’t prove anything right? in spite of all the brain fog from your covid infection ."
"​ck lee you really have a case of covid derangement syndrome. even when i sent you the info, you are too lazy to read them. here i will post it  in autumn 2020 pfizer’s chairman and chief executive, albert bourla, released an open letter to the billions of people around the world who were investing their hopes in a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine to end the pandemic. “as i’ve said before, we are operating at the speed of science,” bourla wrote, explaining to the public when they could expect a pfizer vaccine to be authorised in the united states.1 but, for researchers who were testing pfizer’s vaccine at several sites in texas during that autumn, speed may have come at the cost of data integrity and patient safety. a regional director who was employed at the research organisation ventavia research group has told the bmj that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in pfizer’s pivotal phase iii trial. staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding. after repeatedly notifying ventavia of these problems, the regional director, brook jackson, emailed a complaint to the us food and drug administration (fda). ventavia fired her later the same day. jackson has provided the bmj with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails."
"ck lee poor laboratory management on its website ventavia calls itself the largest privately owned clinical research company in texas and lists many awards it has won for its contract work.2 but jackson has told the bmj that, during the two weeks she was employed at ventavia in september 2020, she repeatedly informed her superiors of poor laboratory management, patient safety concerns, and data integrity issues. jackson was a trained clinical trial auditor who previously held a director of operations position and came to ventavia with more than 15 years’ experience in clinical research coordination and management. exasperated that ventavia was not dealing with the problems, jackson documented several matters late one night, taking photos on her mobile phone. one photo, provided to the bmj, showed needles discarded in a plastic biohazard bag instead of a sharps container box. another showed vaccine packaging materials with trial participants’ identification numbers written on them left out in the open, potentially unblinding participants. ventavia executives later questioned jackson for taking the photos."
"ck lee early and inadvertent unblinding may have occurred on a far wider scale. according to the trial’s design, unblinded staff were responsible for preparing and administering the study drug (pfizer’s vaccine or a placebo). this was to be done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and all other site staff, including the principal investigator. however, at ventavia, jackson told the bmj that drug assignment confirmation printouts were being left in participants’ charts, accessible to blinded personnel. as a corrective action taken in september, two months into trial recruitment and with around 1000 participants already enrolled, quality assurance checklists were updated with instructions for staff to remove drug assignments from charts."
"ck lee in a recording of a meeting in late september2020 between jackson and two directors a ventavia executive can be heard explaining that the company wasn’t able to quantify the types and number of errors they were finding when examining the trial paperwork for quality control. “in my mind, it’s something new every day,” a ventavia executive says. “we know that it’s significant.”"
"ck lee ventavia was not keeping up with data entry queries, shows an email sent by icon, the contract research organisation with which pfizer partnered on the trial. icon reminded ventavia in a september 2020 email: “the expectation for this study is that all queries are addressed within 24hrs.” icon then highlighted over 100 outstanding queries older than three days in yellow. examples included two individuals for which “subject has reported with severe symptoms/reactions … per protocol, subjects experiencing grade 3 local reactions should be contacted. please confirm if an unplanned contact was made and update the corresponding form as appropriate.” according to the trial protocol a telephone contact should have occurred “to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated.”"
"ck lee worries over fda inspection documents show that problems had been going on for weeks. in a list of “action items” circulated among ventavia leaders in early august 2020, shortly after the trial began and before jackson’s hiring, a ventavia executive identified three site staff members with whom to “go over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc.” one of them was “verbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry,” a note indicates. at several points during the late september meeting jackson and the ventavia executives discussed the possibility of the fda showing up for an inspection (box 1). “we’re going to get some kind of letter of information at least, when the fda gets here . . . know it,” an executive stated."
"ck lee a history of lax oversight when it comes to the fda and clinical trials, elizabeth woeckner, president of citizens for responsible care and research incorporated (circare),3 says the agency’s oversight capacity is severely under-resourced. if the fda receives a complaint about a clinical trial, she says the agency rarely has the staff available to show up and inspect. and sometimes oversight occurs too late. in one example circare and the us consumer advocacy organisation public citizen, along with dozens of public health experts, filed a detailed complaint in july 2018 with the fda about a clinical trial that failed to comply with regulations for the protection of human participants.4 nine months later, in april 2019, an fda investigator inspected the clinical site. in may this year the fda sent the triallist a warning letter that substantiated many of the claims in the complaints. it said, “[i]t appears that you did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects.”5 “there’s just a complete lack of oversight of contract research organisations and independent clinical research facilities,” says jill fisher, professor of social medicine at the university of north carolina school of medicine and author of medical research for hire: the political economy of pharmaceutical clinical trials."
"ck lee ventavia and the fda a former ventavia employee told the bmj that the company was nervous and expecting a federal audit of its pfizer vaccine trial. “people working in clinical research are terrified of fda audits,” jill fisher told the bmj, but added that the agency rarely does anything other than inspect paperwork, usually months after a trial has ended. “i don’t know why they’re so afraid of them,” she said. but she said she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect ventavia after an employee had filed a complaint. “you would think if there’s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that,” fisher said. in 2007 the department of health and human services’ office of the inspector general released a report on fda’s oversight of clinical trials conducted between 2000 and 2005. the report found that the fda inspected only 1% of clinical trial sites.6 inspections carried out by the fda’s vaccines and biologics branch have been decreasing in recent years, with just 50 conducted in the 2020 fiscal year.7"
"ck lee the next morning, 25 september 2020, jackson called the fda to warn about unsound practices in pfizer’s clinical trial at ventavia. she then reported her concerns in an email to the agency. in the afternoon ventavia fired jackson—deemed “not a good fit,” according to her separation letter. jackson told the bmj it was the first time she had been fired in her 20 year career in research."
"ck lee concerns raised in her 25 september email to the fda jackson wrote that ventavia had enrolled more than 1000 participants at three sites. the full trial (registered under nct04368728) enrolled around 44 000 participants across 153 sites that included numerous commercial companies and academic centres. she then listed a dozen concerns she had witnessed, including: participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events protocol deviations not being reported vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures mislabelled laboratory specimens, and targeting of ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems."
"ck lee within hours jackson received an email from the fda thanking her for her concerns and notifying her that the fda could not comment on any investigation that might result. a few days later jackson received a call from an fda inspector to discuss her report but was told that no further information could be provided. she heard nothing further in relation to her report. in pfizer’s briefing document submitted to an fda advisory committee meeting held on 10 december 2020 to discuss pfizer’s application for emergency use authorisation of its covid-19 vaccine, the company made no mention of problems at the ventavia site. the next day the fda issued the authorisation of the vaccine.8"
"ck lee in august this year, after the full approval of pfizer’s vaccine, the fda published a summary of its inspections of the company’s pivotal trial. nine of the trial’s 153 sites were inspected. ventavia’s sites were not listed among the nine, and no inspections of sites where adults were recruited took place in the eight months after the december 2020 emergency authorisation. the fda’s inspection officer noted: “the data integrity and verification portion of the bimo [bioresearch monitoring] inspections were limited because the study was ongoing, and the data required for verification and comparison were not yet available to the ind [investigational new drug].”"
"ck lee other employees’ accounts in recent months jackson has reconnected with several former ventavia employees who all left or were fired from the company. one of them was one of the officials who had taken part in the late september meeting. in a text message sent in june the former official apologised, saying that “everything that you complained about was spot on.” two former ventavia employees spoke to the bmj anonymously for fear of reprisal and loss of job prospects in the tightly knit research community. both confirmed broad aspects of jackson’s complaint. one said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never experienced such a “helter skelter” work environment as with ventavia on pfizer’s trial."
"ck lee “i’ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,” she told the bmj. “it just seemed like something a little different from normal—the things that were allowed and expected.” she added that during her time at ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came. after jackson left the company problems persisted at ventavia, this employee said. in several cases ventavia lacked enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. laboratory confirmed symptomatic covid-19 was the trial’s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (an fda review memorandum released in august this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19.) “i don’t think it was good clean data,” the employee said of the data ventavia generated for the pfizer trial. “it’s a crazy mess.”"
"ck lee a second employee also described an environment at ventavia unlike any she had experienced in her 20 years doing research. she told the bmj that, shortly after ventavia fired jackson, pfizer was notified of problems at ventavia with the vaccine trial and that an audit took place."
"is moh finally going to tell us how many ""actual"" infected cases we have else us will categorise singapore as unknown risk indefinitely"
pretty sure the us is just using it as a political excuse to punish us for getting too close to china
pretty sure singapore has less positive cases than the us which has hit 1 million cases.
tf you gonna do about it in face of real power.
pokemonfan01 for not taking their side. for being neutral
why bother about us when it's in the best interest for their citizens to stay away from us with them reporting a daily covid cases of 1 million
w wwai pretty sure us is 100x bigger than us in terms of geography and population. maybe get yourself educated before commenting nonsense.
pokemonfan01  you are absolutely right.  not easy to stay neutral
taeyeonist -  so what? get some education on geography and history
w wwai take singapore cases and multiply by at least 60 then compare it to cases in us. we aren't doing any better than us. a few months back singapore was having close to 10k cases per day compared to 30k all over the us. who is doing worse if ratio of population is accounted for?
"<b>""give me the control over the money and i don't care who makes the rules""</b> rothschild its global because the imf/emf money printing machines controls the global money ! therefore you must have a p(l)andemic or your systems got shut down !!! wake up people !!"

"🤣🤣🤣 if that is so, why always keep reminding us not to overwhelm  the healthcare? you don't comprehend?"
lucy yeo  the unvaccinated are likely to overwhelm the hospitals. the science says
"lucy yeo  it’s you who don’t comprehend.  what we are now facing is a universal problem, the whole world is having the same dilemma. the situation is totally hopeless in the us that the army is deployed to help in their hospitals, if you read the latest news you’ll know.  israel, uk, australia are now following our singapore method of home stay recovery. are you a singaporean? if you are, consider yourself damn lucky, just take a look at the neighboring countries and their hospitals and you can start counting your blessings...."
now are we telling the world singapore have omicron? do the rest of the world going to live with singapore and omicron? as we are going to live with it.

justfair u. s. a
"""the united states centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) advised americans against travelling to singapore because it is not aware of the city-state's covid-19 surveillance test numbers...."""
"the united states centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) is controlled by politicians and the cia. that was very obvious during the trump administration. their expertise in health science  is rendered impotent by politics. informatiion on covid-19 measures, statics, and updates are all free available on the internet and even in youtube. furthermore, if the us cdc should request for any information, they will be given. singaapore won't tell them go to hell, or scacastically tell them they can check moh websites themselves. us not aware of the city-state's covid-19 surveillance test numbers is their barefaced bs."
singapore xiasuay!
"the us opened their vtl to the 6 african states a few weeks ago,  and immediately singapore. followed blindly also to allow vtl to those african states."
so it is never easy to stay neutral and be a friend of us and china. things like this are tools they use.  get wise leaders.

you are absolutely right.economy is important. look at our neighbours.  they are suffering. no income. in fact so many suicides due to loss of earnings
very clear direction and explanation compared to australian government. let's hope omicron will take over delta and be our way out of covid.
we are proud of our leaders
meanwhile in lhl's head: moar gst.
gst should be raised to 12%. we have to balance our budget. too many whiners who want free rides in spore
omg lmao😆😅🤣
justfair nice sarcasm!
justfair it's the whiners who want free ride. we have to say no to those demand free stuffs and money instead of raising tax
the imperfect perfectionist  we are running a budget deficit for many years already. we are using 50% of nirc to balance the budget. can we continue to do this? i dont know. the health care costs are rising. can we increase income tax easily? i think no. gst is fair.
justfair not everyone can afford. give a thought to those single elderly and retirees.
"justfair i am in kenya, vat is 16%, income tax 30% flat on average  salary of usd180 pm. last month i was in uganda where vat is 18% .so my friend you are right, it's too low"
"star lite  we have to upgrade and invest in our health facilities for the elderly and retirees, right? where is the money coming from? are you willing to increase your income tax?"
dave choy  you are right. here our gst is too low.the money has to come from somewhere.  people here are too self entitled. they don't know how the money come.the populist opposition leaders are feeding them self entitlement.
"justfair go ahead and raise the income tax then, as high as you wish !!"
star lite  your neighbours will complain
justfair that's what you are satisfied with. you are most qualified to explain to everybody about increasing gst and income tax
justfair i shall not engage with you anymore
justfair screw these selfish single elderly they dun want marry have kids now no one to care for em. they are a drain of society
this april 2022 will be two years since the beginning. how much more will the mtf destroy singapore?
"they are useless. need to step down. they only know how to lock us down. we need to open the borders and go back to the normal life: no mask, no vaccine."
the mtf is doing a very fine job. we salute them. cool heads and visionary .
"its already 2 years, covid-19 started in jan 2020. mtf headed by the incompetent ong ye kun only has the vaccine solution. look at india, early treatment help them  overcome delta and they are doing very well now!"
"justfair no heads🤯, no vision. any how hum tam."
lucy yeo  vision is clear. we must open up. get vaccinated
a mockery session 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
"what a laughing matter, 2 shots will become no shot by 14 this month - forcing everybody to take the 3rd shot and then 4th shot and then how many more years to live? delta and omicron are nano-size viruses, they penetrate and transmit easily everywhere, social distancing mask or no mask will be of no use. stupid people stupid measures!"
"today's challenge; find something negative concerning the vaccines that is factual (test is of no value if not factual). post as a comment on youtube videos related to vaccine, the plandemic, etc. and do the same on facebook. monitor how long it takes to be automatically removed. goebbel's propaganda machine is hard at work. only this time it is not working for the far right, it is working for the far left."
i hope those audience stop asking stupid question 🙏😡
"sad that singaporeans blindly follow this leadership with no question. the mtf has already, and will continue to destroy the economy of singapore. all talk and no action. singapore will no longer be a hub, and will soon become a third world country like its neighbors. just watch"
"b  there’s no doubt that you’re not a singaporean, so mind your damn business. hub or no hub is not important, not your business."
bell1980 ok sheep
"b if you are non-singaporean, better you stop your nonsense 😡 and making such disingaporeusting comment 😡.but if you are singaporean, since you dislike singapore so much  ,by all means get yourself migrate to other http://countries.is/countries.is there a necessity for you to criticize singapore until like that???😡"
"fanny choo  vicious people like b are usually from those 3rd world countries, dying to come to singapore either to make money , find work or simply treating singapore as a haven to escape from their own miserable existence from wherever they’re from. these people instead of badmouthing singapore should look at their own corrupted governments and why they’re dying to come here. no genuine singaporeans will ever say those vicious things like singapore going back to 3rd world that kind of garbage, b is definitely not a singaporean, but a very spiteful jealous individual from a neighboring country"
bell1980 you don’t know me. you don’t know anything about me. i do know singapore is a country built on mncs. take one look at the skyline and dare you to say otherwise. i know that you don’t like foreigners. you blame foreigners for stealing jobs you simply don’t have the skillset for. my comments are sheer facts. your comments are based solely on emotion and anger. look how angry you are. what foreigner outperformed you in your workplace that you have such resentment? the fact that you assume i am not singaporean and/or am from a surrounding country is hilarious and just outright sad for you. we’re done talking. goodbyeee
singapore government is an international disingaporerace and at this rate we will go back to third world
fanny choo singaporeans have every right to criticize the government. if you want a circle jerk please go to fb
"then their ""journo"" license would be revoked."
taeyeonist - i as a singaporean also have the right to criticize you shameless and disingaporeusting 😡 making criticism on singapore 😡
"fanny choo you do have the rights but please , all your comments are just unproductive criticisms . it is disheartening to have this type of singaporean that comments onto people based on their personal emotions . don’t you know that your beloved grandfather lky was the first to import foreigners from china ? so why hate the foreigners knowing that your fore fathers might be a foreigner?"
zan ellis i am replying to individual comment 😡 better you mind your own business 😡

"then the otherside kp govt for not opening up more and ""living with covid"" what you want? damned if you do, damned if you don't"
ssvegeto find a lane and stick to it but they can't even do that.
"ssvegeto  most of the negative comments come from foreigners who are dying to come to singapore, and now with all these restrictions going on, many just badmouth singapore government...genuine singaporeans are grateful and know our government is doing all the best they can to help citizens, so they don’t complain."
ops blac  why so many more ungrateful and unwanted people like you are dying to come to singapore?
ops blac gee it's almost like you shouldn't be stubborn and make changes accordingly if the situation call for it? but i guess you've never had to make any real decision in life before hence why you think decisions in life have to binary
bell1980 highly doubt that's the case. you can continue to bury your ignorant head in the sand
"ssvegeto its almost like singapore never faced a viral spread before but hey, the highest paid ministers in the world can always fall back on the quintessential 'hindsight is 20/20' as a free get out of jail excuse"
ops blac  are you jealous?

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl to malaysia, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
"besides malaysians that stay in jb and come to work in singapore daily, there is another group of singaporeans who stay in jb that needs to come to work in singapore and return to jb daily. please allow land vtl gurantine free travel both ways for this group too, especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only 2 or less passengers or upto 4 paxs if they are immediate family members. all vaccinated. also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in jb should be facilitated to allow 2 way vtl gurantine free land travel soonest possible. this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over 20 months now just because they couldn't return to their jb homes."

vaccinated...no quarantine... confirmed....????
"once  fully vaccinated, just open all borders without any restrictions like pcr tests etc. after all its stated that once fully vaccinated, at most, will be imfacted but no icu and nothing serious. then what's the issue here? or is it the va pcr is bringing handsome revenue? life is simple, keep life simple"

good work ministers. please give yourselves bonus 🙏
i think 24 months bonus will be fair
for sure traveling will be not the same . once virus if disappears only  will get the fun of traveling . vaccinated traveling is a risk
i dnt believe no quarantine
all about extracting money so the people dwindles their savings and become dependent upon teh government further or just out themselves.  this is nwo tactic.
"so if we use vtl travel to kl , can we go out from kl and travel to other town?"
town council ?
yes! its time to open travel lanes between us and malaysia to cross breed our covid efforts and generate new strains!
thought he is smart😅
singapore must not open vtl at woodlands check point. malaysian government and it people's had a bad habit of switch off the tap water. etc. so what singapore needs to do now. just wait for another 6 months. high risk.
what does switching off tap water supply have to do with opening borders?
singapore is heading for big trouble. we must stop free quarantine  travel with malaysia for another 6 months. high risk.
open up.
great job by the govt of singapore. more countries will definitely come on board soon.
thank you pap… professional art should be a lot cheaper …. korea charging s$200-250 per pcr test
it's very bad news for jb business community.

"its weird infection rates are still thousands but they are talking about open borders for travelling just because majority are vaccinated, they talk as if the vaccines are working 🤷‍♂️"
they need new reasons for people to take the booster vaccines lol pfizer will be a trillionaire company

it's nice to hear people talk about investment because investment always beat cash
i understand the fact that tomorrow isn't promised to anyone just investing today is a hard thing to do because i have no idea of how or where to invest in.

cheers
all must wfh but can open up so many vtl. cannot go back office but can go for holiday. can allow so many foreigners to come in n roam around singapore without quarantine n we still cannot go back to the office. what kind of logic is this?
who need office nowadays? don’tyouhappy wfh?
wfh for those able to do so. travellers that enter singapore also have to follow the measures in place and they are all vaccinated whereas in workplace or singapore itself some yet to be vaccinated.
"okay what wfh . why must go back office? if you ask 1000 people, they also want. lol"
this method can be use to catch crooks. give them a jab
how abt.whom took 3rd booster vaccine? can travel to m'sia and come bck to singapore. without quarantine???
that is the spirit 🙌 good 👍
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
"james lim love the pap, but sometimes i don't vote for them if they behave like softie opposition.  need to whack th unvax, now i surely vote for them. i already 3 shots,  i am lao lao uncle, and everyone i know all get shots and get booster as soon as possible. after shots i go for 5km run after 2 days http://rest.do/rest.do pullups and gym like crazy. what is the problem?"
"that is the purpose of air vtl. i know why you asking this, because you hoping for causeway open right?"
don't tell me  some peoples are scare of vaccination. never heard of it. some eat healthy food and seldom fall sick which category are they in  can protect people health    .
add flight lane but not open the causeways?
close
must support airlines first lahhh…🤦🏻‍♂️
sq needs some oxygen
simon you can say that again bro 😎
"the causeway is always open. oh wait, you want no quarantine on both side so you can do daily travel. hmm... teach me how to spot fake documents in seconds,  fake pcr result,  for up to 50thousand people daily. must be foolproof."
i'm ready to go penang eat nasi kandar!

"returning sc from indonesia need 10 days quarantine, 48hrs before flight pcr, landed singapore airport pcr.... even thou sc was fully vaccinated in singapore before leaving  country. watching european n american landed singapore & walk free, it makes returning sc 2nd class citizen or vaccine n pcr is bs?"
"singapore, proud modern colony of british empire ;d"
all travellers be it returning singapore citizens do not have to serve quarantine if coming from countries that have vtl arrangement with singapore. however indonesia is not one of it so need to serve quarantine.
"maca roon if so, 2 injection + booster is the not the matter, sc is not the matter , whatever we followed the govt regulations so far is not the matter, the matter is the country should be in vtl list, vtl is based on other country covid case and bilateral agreements.  vtl is for other country people, for sc & other resident strictly support govt actions for last 2years still suffer.  our (sc+) relationships countries are not in vtl list. 😮 omg"

so can travelers visit other states after arriving in kl and then return to singapore via kl without quarantine???
"subjected to a negative test result + pcr test on arrival. so, does it matter if someone visit other states?"
yes you can travel anywhere around malaysia. there is no movement restriction in malaysia anymore
what state you referring to ?
youtube account what about sabah and sarawak ?
"youtube account, so what you are saying is this; a singaporean flies to kl, goes to penang for a couple of days, comes back to kl to take the flight back to singapore, and no quarantine upon arrival at singapore?"
boba fett  already opened
"boba fett yes, malaysia has already opened up all cross state travel"

no mention of pcr test on arrival and pre-departure from singapore at $135.00 each plus hotel isolation pending test result. in any case why was rat accepted for testing changi staff ( at around $20 ) but arriving passengers are wounded financially ? as an australian i am taking a risk entering your country given your current high case numbers so i will defer my holidays for another 3-5 months. i can here your locals cheering...lol plus..what happened to the covid breath testing systems being trialled at tuas ?
"are they sure it's safe to open up? in the past, 60,000 tests were done per day. as of last update, only 20,000 tests were done per day. fewer test means fewer case, does not mean it's getting better."
"as a singaporean living abroad - this is a step closer to visit hometown. i don't see why can't singapore reopen the borders again, with safety precautionary of course. europe has opened to the world again although there's still cases and some are still not vaccinated  almost back to normal. some part of the world knows that they can't close their country for a really long time"

safety for everyone. great job by the ministry.

"comparing taiwan and singapore,  you will see a direct opposite in handling covid 19, since beginning of 2020 till now.   taiwan was well controlled from starts,  its economy hardly impact by covid 19.   whereas, singapore has never really had a break from covid 19 since first case on 23rd jan 2020 till now.   economy is badly hit and still on going.  taiwan won lots of praises n recognition internationally,  whereas nobody mentioned singapore.  if they do, its mostly mockery, ridicule or negative.   singapore years of good reputation and good name is ruined in the hands of incompetents over 2 years"
"what to do, taiwan heeds the real experts in handling the virus, whereas we only have “experts” taking us for a ride. in asia, i can safely say taiwan has one of the best healthcare system and doctors around. based on a personal experience here and there, was played around by many local doctors in singapore and am utterly disappointed."
"dean lee taiwan face the problem squarely,  no hidding, no avoidance, no dumb measures, no  incompetent leaders, no fake experts"
does taiwan practise discrimination against the unvaccinated?
"fred mad no, it the closest to true democratic system in asia."
"dean lee yup, taiwan health care 👍👍👍.  singapore health care was very good 30 to 40 years ago.  deterioration started after, till today and on-going."
don't agree. you go move to taiwan more suitable for you
lisa lim ccp wumao !
"dean lee actually we do have accredited experts, just that they may be opposition and pap don't actually believe in putting the right people for the job."

"put your trust not in this world nor the things in it. it's not going to last. but lord jesus christ, the risen savior suffered, bled, and died on the cross for your sins. he was buried and rose on the 3rd day according to the scriptures! he is the only begotten son of the living god of the heavens and earth! he is the only way to eternal life. he bore your sins and wants you to come by faith and believe on him. repent of your sins and trust in him. confess him as your lord and savior. he's coming back to earth soon to gather those who have put their trust and faith in him alone. you don't need to fear  the end of this world he's going to judge evil people and those who refuse to trust in him. they experience god's wrath and they will be punished  eternally. those who trust in jesus christ are safe! he is our only hope.  no good person, good behavior or money can save you!!!  no earthly plan can save you!!!  only jesus christ gives you the chance to be born again through faith in him and security.  his gift of eternal life is free, but it costed him everything.  don't waste your chance to be free from sin and receive eternal life!"

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."

"how russian citizens smashed the silly moscow vaccination passports in just 3 weeks.  abstract: this is how mayor sobyanin's vaccine passport was smashed - and it was pretty straightforward.  moscow residents simply stopped going to any business that required a vaccine passport. the most beautiful thing about all this is that the vaccinated showed solidarity with the unvaccinated.  the business was reduced almost to zero in all the establishments in which the vaccination passport was required. muscovites grew their hair out, stopped going to bars and restaurants, didn't go to the movies, stayed in hotels, or did anything that required a vaccination passport. businessmen across the city suddenly called mayor sobyanin's office to scold him for the vaccination passports. they were ruining themselves and they were very angry about it. marina zemskova, director of a regional hotel and restaurant association in russia, said the vaccine passport turned out to be worse for the business than a total shutdown.  at least, if there were another shutdown, she points out, the businesses ""could count on some kind of supportive measures from the government."" with a vaccine passport system there is no government support.  what the not very elitist elites did not foresee about the residents of moscow was that they simply would not participate in the scam at all. the businessmen were so enraged at the mayor that sobyanin made a sudden and surprising announcement on july 19 that it was no longer necessary for anyone to use the vaccine passport.  a hilarious excuse was made, claiming that covid case rates had suddenly improved, as a reason to lift qr code passports. but everyone knew the truth. the muscovites decided that their medical privacy and their right to travel are more important than what the officials told them. it was a massive case of civil disobedience, and they didn't even have to go outside and set things on fire in a big protest. all they did was say, ""any business that wants to see a vaccine passport from me is not going to get any of my money."" this is how you do it. 👏👏👏 pls share."

with the 4th wave going through germany 🇩🇪.. please do this with great careful consideration and caution...
"i find the reasoning of allowing <b>only</b> germany to singapore rather puzzling: germany is part of the schengen area, and as such, everyone from countries like netherlands, belgium, sweden, greece, france or spain  can travel  into germany and then fly to singapore as well. yes, there is an official requirement of a negative pcr-test or proof of full vaccination in order to enter germany, but the control is often lax. or , should you rather show proof of residence in germany if you want to book a flight to singapore ?"

this guy looks unfamiliar and foreign to me. i dun know why but he gave me the kind of uncaring and sinister impression at first glance.
your impression is correct but he's a local mama i can vouch for that because we were teenagers when we were neighbors . but i'ved never rubbed shoulders or rubbed  anything else with him   🤮 🐕‍🦺 💩
"best , good news 🌠👍👍👍.  .... thanks all, .... cheerio.🌠👍👍👍."
isnt this kind of risky
if you open up to germany ... are you not indirectly opening up to the eu as a whole (due to the relative freedom of movement within the union)? ... seems risky tbh
i got mixed feelings about this
nx new rule introduced vaccinated mask only vaccinated people the mask can fits 😂😂😂😂😂
we should open our borders  to other countries that have a similar vaccination rate and vaccination effort as well as vs the no. of cases they experience at time of consideration.  we really cannot risk covid further mutating into harder to contain strains.
local lah  first live with covid see this goodos can manage or not😁

interesting.... how wil ica know if any eu passport has been in germany 21days before depart to singapore?...... mtf mil$ math!
aiyoh....the passport will show the date they enter germany what! when is the last time you travel?
"khairul iqram soyounever been to eu! which kampongyoufm? learn dude, whenyoutravel within eu, there is no immigration stamp. within eu countries."
"that is why one needs to declare that one has not been outside germany.. n has been inside the last 21 days.. same thing when you declare about your health status whenyouenter singapore.. of course no one knows but ifyouget caught for not declaring the truth,youget the consequences😬"
"ezra singapore y need immigration, police if every1 is honest, truthful, sharing, kind..... stop dreaming. expecially in pandemic, character change dude. since there is loop hole in immigration control, singapore govt should announce, ""schengen, 27 member eu countries enter singapore quarantine free!"""
"jimbaran residence i agree with you.. like i said this is everyone‘s resposibility.. if everyone is honest then the world would be peaceful.. but its otjerwise right.. so i guess singapore gov wants to try slowly lah... im living in germany.. the politics here itself is somehow not logic.. but just for your info , here also there is also control if one comes into germany from other higher risk eu countries."
"ezra singapore  aaaai ya , don't worried lah , they are too dumb to catch anyone . one mama from india worked in singapore  as a senior management staff with fake credentials for more than 10 years . that was why our famous small space jt is no longer manpower minitress"
"koh yang chi  eu has 27 countries, germany is the gateway to singapore. when they cross border each other, no checking. singapore should announce, schengen enter singapore quarantine free!"
ok. let's bring it on.
what about india ?
report say that all countries had been vaccinated
"travellers from all other countries/ regions (except bangladesh, india, myanmar, nepal, pakistan and sri lanka, where entry is currently not allowed4) will be required to undergo a 14-day stay-home notice (shn) at dedicated shn facilities. travellers will also be required to comply with the testing regime as indicated in annex"

jerry ang agree 💯
malaysia boh luik lew no money no talk

jerry ang you do know that there is no quarantine from china? if you travel from china to singapore now there is zero quarantine required. so travelers from china already have an advantage over anyone else.
"farrah kong we have enough of malaysian. they are all opportunist, they can turn their back to singapore fast and swift."

koh yang chi just go google it. china and singapore as of writing really no need 14 day quarantine unless sick.
koh yang chi yes. i know of someone who came to singapore from china last week.
germany 9000 cases today er…
"9000 maybe its unvaccinated ppl.. the travel lane still need to be fully vaccinated, than take test before departing germany, on arrival another test.. then 3rd day, 1 more test and 7 day 1 more test.. so a lot of ""checks"" in place."
"yes , we have infections thats a fact.. but you also have to see what is the per 100k population for the infections.. for example. singapore is 6,5/100 000 population, germany: 44,9/100 000, malaysia:451/100 000 .."
"tse hong ling .. ya lahh. too many checks lah.. one here in germany, and then have to pre paid for pcr tests ni singapore.. 😱😭"
"""9000 maybe""."
"ezra singapore infection is one thing.. hospitalized is another. so far from uk's example.. even though the cases are up.. the deaths and icu and serious cases are not that high. so hopefully it means most of those have no symptoms or just mild flu and stay indoors. we got to try opening up a bit.. even if its just 2 countries.. unless we want to remain shut till 2023.. by sept 8, vaccination rate in singapore should be over 80% maybe 81% which makes 9% unvaccinated.."
"tse hong ling .. i agree with u.. singapore has to open up slowly..of course there will be trial n error in the begining..isnt it the direction that we all should get vaccinated.. although even when one get vaccinated, one can still get the virus.. but at least whn one is vaccinated and also follow protocol, the chances are much lower than those who didnt want /not vaccinated."
"ezra singapore i think its unusual for a country to take stages to open up, since so far we have only seen countries like uk who opt to go 'ok turn off all restrictions, and go freedom day"" or have restrictions in place , for singapore to try and pick a middle route and how to manage it..its harder and no one knows how it will turn out so a lot of skeptical and negative comments. hopefully it will be fine.."
"tse hong ling well.. we have start somewhere.. but at least a decision is made.. be it good or bad, we do not know, lets hope fir the best.. i remebef when singapore closed since 18 mar last year, n then people in singapore are going restless.. n said they should open, now that singapore is slowly open, the people are afraid?.. thats sad"
"ezra singapore yeah i watched the movie ""trolls"" on gv on 3rd april 2020.. on the same day they announce the circuit breaker start on 6 apr..  havent been to the cinema since.."
"ezra singapore as minister ong say there is 3 groups of ppl, 1 will say why dun open up more, scared for what?? the other will say what? are you crazy, shut the borders and dun let anyone in. the 3rd group just try to find a middle ground. so whatever we decide, either the 1st group or the 2nd group will come in to criticize."
"tse hong ling . that is very sad isnt it?.. my family is living in singapore n here i am in germany , n have not seen my family since 2020.. and i also feel sorry for people who have families just across the causeway n not able to be with them for more than 500 days!!… its soo near n yet soo far away..😢"
"tse hong ling aiiyaahh..youknow lah people‘s mouth. these people always have something bad coming out from their mouth.. instead of listening and evaluating and discuss, they started to criticisw with having the knowledge."
i’m worried of the children who are not eligible for vac.
"osman ismail .. when it comes to children, i myself not sure its good or not"
"with the emergence of omicron, are we going to close our vtl with countries with higher risks and higher interactivities with sa and it neighboring countries?"
"kns..strict control on internal resident  but open gates for the highest risk countries...ya ifyouopen gates to all then is  time to lift up restriction on singapore resident,  at least bet families members and closed one for house visit n  dinning....the virus not only looking for singaporean n pr....and these foreigners are main carriers too...."

this is madness. how can vtl be given to india? haven’t singapore suffered enough from the india delta variant? why welcome the delta variant plus from india?
cuz uncle modi called up your pm who obliged like a puppy.
why india is included when its  infection rate is one of the highest????
"it mention that those 21 countries are most contributors to daily arrivals in singapore before pandemic. if yr country is not considered as significant contributor, be patient to wait for next vtl or pay for shn at hotels."

expect covid cases to get worst !!!!
"yes,, singapore is land of virus"
the delta variant has done enough damage. time to open more vtls. its time to welcome the delta plus variant.

can we even trust malaysia to open vtl singapore cause malaysia can change their mind to say no we will not open vtl lane with singapore
"so the rich and filty  and  the filty rich can take a flight to kl  then take another flight to senai,  then take a taxi to jb.  while the not so rich and the poor has to wait patiently for the causeway to open.        this is a clear discrimination between the rich and the poor.  i don't understand what they are thinking...."
i hope there will be some measures to prevent pre covid nightmare crossing the customs.
hello mysians...why so  like that bodhhhh like that...singapore is all about $$$$ n ¢....spend so much $$$ on buying aeroplane n how can allow land vtl now? its like opening the floodgates of hell break loose...
"besides malaysians that stay in jb and come to work in singapore daily, there is another group of singaporeans who stay in jb that needs to come to work in singapore and return to jb daily. please allow land vtl gurantine free travel both ways for this group too, especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only 2 or less passengers or upto 4 paxs if they are immediate family members. all vaccinated. also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in jb should be facilitated to allow 2 way vtl gurantine free land travel soonest possible. this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over 20 months now just because they couldn't return to their jb homes."
"i pity those who went back and thought they can have a three months break and come back to singapore after the circuit breaks. most of them thought, they are entitled to their old jobs or they could frogged to another company like before. unfortunately, many did not get to return. either the company fold up or the boss taking this opportunity to dismiss the unproductive. of course, there are many hardworking who got to return with all expenses paid."
malaysian only work in retail or food industry many had gone bust.
singapore is a modern day slavery nation. does not allow malaysians to go back home
singapore is a modern day slavery nation. does not allow malaysians to go back home
"looking at some of comments , many people don't  understand about vaccine and travel lanes. vtl is meant to ease restriction for vaccinated travellers by exempting or compromising quarantine protocols. however, with the current vaccination, there is no gurantee that vaccinated person will not contract covid19. the delta variant is extremely transmissible and data has shown that in can infect majority of vaccinated persons. that is the reason pcr test is mandatory before and after arrival, in addition to vaccinated certificates. however, pcr test is not full proof as people who test negative before arrival can be tested positive upon arrival. why this happen is probably poorly understood. can you immagine the logistics issue required to check vaccinated certificates and pcr verification at land border? pcr test required qualified person to conduct and document the test  is simply mind boggling! secondly, knowingly that a country with high population  density has daily infected running in the thousands and vaccinated can still be infected, why would you take such a risk if you have that option? travelling is optional but covid19 infections  is not!"
"please activate the ferry from singapore to johore, last time there was a service , from mersing to harbour front and was cancelled. please activate this mode of travel."
you mean to batam
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything.
malaysia desperate for sing dollars.😝😂
without our water you can't drink hello kitty
"singapore is heading for big trouble. stop. stop and must stop vtl with malaysia. their government and its citizens always say * turn of tap "" no water fot singapore. why not wait for another 6 to 12 months. malaysia is a high risk covid-19 country.  ."
"we are more worried about our closest neighbouring states like malaysia whom we are more connected generally, infact we are practically families ....!!!!!!!!!!!  and yet we welcome almost daily from india, china and  all those 'wealthy'  europeans countries and especially the united states, the nos. 1 holder/champion  for  deaths and infections since day one and still rising of these deadly covid virus... wtf...!!!!!!!!!!!!"
malaysian choose to come here. nobody owns you anything.
i thought you are from malaysia?
"singapore small country, what do you expect?"
"invest in singapore with no land, no man power and no resources? risking your investment in singapore?  soon the sea water and floods will hit severely singapore it might sunk in the sea water in the future since neighbouring are continuing making floating cities so that means sea levels may rise as well... good luck to your business... cities of neighbouring countries are fast developing and better than singapore."
"sinceyouppl have such thinking,youshould go back to your own country to enjoy. singapore is a sinking country. let our own singaporean sink with our own country."
vin diz why are you wishing bad things on spore?  are you in the base of our rich country?
"coshinc really rich? if singapore is rich how come people of singapore living in a small flat and crying how pay monthly bills in singapore government? only name rich but not in reality i always roaming around singapore and i know it.... your singapore is tiny nothing to do there is boring, and buildings are old. if you wanna be rich be like kuwait, dubai and doha, citizens are priority. every thing is free there for citizens"
"vin diz  kuwait is given oil by god. we are not given that. why don't migrate there? in every society, there will be the bottom 20% which either they are not lucky or not hard working enough. society cannot be equal otherwise who will clean your rubbish and shit. small flats? look at japan, korea, and hong kong. ever wonder why people need to come here and work as labourers and maids? be grateful is my advice"
"coshinc  you said singapore is rich, but not comparable with kuwait, doha and dubai... singapore is useless country, no man power, no resources and no land haha...  you have said singapore is richer than japan and japan working as nanny in singapore haha funny, just the ppp, little populations, singapore need foreign workers in order to earn more money , when migrant leave singapore goodluck. look  your status at gdp world ranking? shrinking to the deepest core..."
"vin diz our tfr is at 1 1 percent  cannot replace the population, so need to import workers and talents  simple theory."
"coshinc you discriminate foreign workers as maids or others but you use them for country growths?  thats i hate singaporean, arrogant yet no power, no lands, no resources haha. singapore wealth won't stay last, i hope foreign workers would left you behind.."
"vin diz ur a spur grape, i suspect you a mcp too."
"vin diz  why do you wish ill on spore? i don't discriminate against foreigners be them the maids, labourers , fts, investors.  i am asking you to treasure what you have for being blessed to have so many terms of good govt who practise good governance.  all  these are for us to lose if we are not careful and keep mocking and spiting the govt. i mentioned that in 60s ,philippines and srilanka were better than us. it took some bad govts to put them into what they are today. be appreciative and grateful"
"coshinc  you mentioned all those things that i just reinstated.  don't to arrogant it might happened to your country as well, from rich to poor... why i hated singapore, because cna spreading fakes news and showing to the world how ugly our government is, and how poor this country... small country but arrogant. don't worry, china will claime your country and your people back to mainland china..."
"vin diz  if spore has less people like you, we can climb higher. to add people like you into our manpower dilute our strength.  frankly speaking"
"coshinc wow ha dilute? are you sure? why you keep accepting migrant in your tiny little world,  marcos savings in singapore will be withdrawn and singapore keep failings.. look my country new cities beautiful than singapore. hopefully our infrastructures will help my country better than yours. all our informal settlers will be transferred in a better place..  indonesia, philippines, vietnam are growing fast, while singapore no space for growing... spend more wealth in floating cities but also your your floating cities no more because china block singapore in rivers side for expansion."
"vin diz  we need to add talents to our country to be relevant and competitive. forgive me for being frank, and we cannot depend on the likes of pests in our society.too many will sink this country"
"future development isn't dependent on how you snatch the young  aspirants to works in singapore since neighbouring countries has resources and manpower for development. you don't know the future, you have no idea how important to have more populations than smaller. thats the reason why china and america wanted to have more populations in order to survive the future development. can you imagine china populations? how fast they grown in just 3 decades? singapore is getting old, continuing the weakening of the singapore economy and yet no resources. no man power and no land for expansion..."
vin diz  thanks for your sudden enlightenment. we need 10 million population. you are finally right.
vin diz then yyoustill here. go home lah vin dissyboy
"i've got relatives & friends on both sides of the causeway. i understand their pain. i also understand that opening the land vtl now could be disastrous for singapore's medical facilities, where priority should be given to those who stay &/ or work in singapore. actual numbers of covid cases in singapore may seem small as compared to malaysia's but singapore is so much smaller to begin with. nobody can guarantee, and the malaysian government will certainly not dare to give any guarantees, that the covid cases will not explode in singapore if the land vtl is opened. since the focus is always about workers who work in singapore, a possible win-win would be to 1st create a vtl for people who work (wp/ ep) or have long term visitor's pass in singapore. this is a step in the right direction rather than the immediate opening of a land vtl that could result in a usual daily traffic volume of 30k via the causeways."
"what pain ,it is their gov to solve. they are just locusts . singaporeans also had pains . we do not rely on any one to solve. stop the slogan from malaysian s earn sing dollar spend ringgit. they do not contribute to our economy."
johor should cooperaye with spore to build island for developed n called singaporejohore land

"this kind of ""news"" is stupid"
u consider as news? to me it's just propaganda.
for me it's hard truths. weaklings can't accept
coshinc why?
more keen on land vtl can wait since working in s'pore for so many year why not  air vtl is too expensive save that money to buy  things back home or that money for family to use is much more useful.
no need to be jealous. why don't you take over their jobs?
"give one inch, don’t ask for a foot! wait and see… if cases go up with this vtl how?"
no need to open....  malaysia? where is malaysia?
malaysia is our hinterland
#NAME?
if there is vtl by land (even if its not the pre covid daily of 500k people crossing) then singapore will be seeing 100 to 300 death min a day because of the population density and distribution. jb will also see a spike in cases and crimes.
totally agrees with you 👍
they will overwhelmed our hospital.
i think its okay as we are interlinked. we need their workers as our locals are either useless or too choosy
coshinc all i can comment is malaysia boleh. very useful as my office cleaners are. if not i think the virus could easily spread faster. $1 = rm3.08 🇲🇾💯👍
peter nelson  doesn't matter.they are not scared so why are we so scared?
coshinc i guess the pay back home is more scary😱😱😱

"simply put, singapore is not interested to establish full vtl with malaysia. so malaysians folks will have to rely only on the air route. singapore is only interested in attracting affluent travellers from overseas to spend within the country. cheap jb shopping trip is a gone era."
whyyouthink immediately after ge2020 ah heng increased petrol tax ? cosyouall imprisoned on little red dot 🤭🤭
it is only johoreans that want sporeans back.i just wonder whether the rest of malaysians care.
singapore= singa di kandang 🤣🤣🤣
u are absolutely talking full of rubbish.youmust be those atas elite bastards who only go shopping at atas place.
the world population is imprisoned in an open air jail.
"land vtls with jb ain't gonna happen cos of 💰💰 drain out. cheap petrol, shopping, massage + loss of gst"
a good option is to restrict day tripper . should be 5 days or 1 week minimum stay.
i miss going to malaysia for a holiday. hope that the pandemic will subside somehow. 🙏
go and  never cone back without been fined.....go stupid the malaysian custom need revenue
"me  too,  wtf."
i’m afraid daily commuting between countries for work by land will be a thing of the past in post-covid era. hope i am wrong.
you are right singapore has change the laws with mom no more workers from malaysia with motocycles will be think of the past you are no wrong no more suka2 zig zag in singapore
"its impossible to execute vtl on land than on air as follow:- 1 .) the sheer number of people at land crossing far exceed air travellers. how do you check if land travellers vaccinated  documents are genuine and dish out pcr test on the same day. it will take hours if not days to clear the travellers!  2.) crowd control problem when dealing with long line of travellers!   3.) how do one keep safe distancing. anyone watch how crowd exit mrt station during peak hours? there is no safe distancing!  on the causeway or tuas, the crowd easily exceed the numbers of people exiting the mrt station during peak hours."
so you mean only the rich can travel? a ticket might be affordable for you but not for the masses.
"there is a train from singapore to johor, they can setup a system where a limited number of people are allowed to move to and fro."
sa bros where do you store the pcr kit to test travellers and trained personal. each pcr test takes 15 to 30 minutes....the q will be terrible!
"calvin g what a joke, tell me how to control and make sure document is real for 20thousand daily."
"angelofmusic477 it is not about the q, it is about how to make sure and control. in malaysia, you can easily ask someone make a fake document by giving some money.  their corruption is ..."
zhen86 then why vaccinated people still need to do test? whats the point of vtl and getting the vaccine?
calvin g cause you can still get it after the jab. the jab is to reduce the chance of you dying.
the malaysians choose to work and stay here rather than their own country and home. nobody owns them. it's their own choice
zhen86 but there are vaccinated people dying from covid?
"there are so many ways, dont need million dollar salary to figure it out. just activate ferry booking system, there is also the woodlands waterfront/tmft/harbour front that can be used as ferry terminal. everybody will pre-book the tickets, so no overcrowding. for buses and trains, just add more frequency and allow pre booking, or control the bus .example 50 persons per bus and assign the buses , based on bus licence plate number. if they can do app for trace together bus app can also be done. same for train, there already is a system for booking, there will not be any over crowding. i took the train so many time already. it is very good"
thia terry singapore gov just want the daily cheap workers from malaysia. take ferry those worker find not worth to come in.
both governments are trying to find ways to help changi airport and klia to milk some money out of those so eager to travel.
bingo also opening of jb causeway drains 💰💰
causeway opening will still be a long way to go.
of course they need to squezeeee last cent from poor people to enslave population properly
gamer studio we should open the causeway as soon as possible
coshinc provided malaysia and indonesia agree to let us do to record high numbers of cases in the world is here in singapore
gamer studio  i read malaysia is very keen indonesia should be keen too
"coshinc i hope so,that will be very jenerous from them i garanty you singapore gov. will never acept those terms if we was in oposite situation"
vtl air is again for the rich.
"hi smart guy, can teach us a fool proof way to make sure 20 thousand people are negative and vaccinated proof is real? by the way is daily. not happy, spend a bit on the air ticket and go home."
"one more thing, why never compliant about thailand land border still closed?"
so malaysian s are poor need land to cross over. just like 7 month hell gate open for money hungry .????
a c  stupid comment
air ticket also cheap lah not rich also can pay lah
if you asked a malaysians. of course they are greedy to now ask for land vtl and making excuse they are costly. other fdw have no qualm of flying back to meet their families. cost is not a concern when families matter. given them an inch and they greedily take a mile.
i agree with you.
actually only johoreans care about the land vtl. i live in kl and the cost for flight and driving almost same.
that's typical malaysian wat. first dayyouknow them?
locals on both sides not too keen on this. its gonna create a large scale pandamic for singapore. pap might gonna aim for 10k daily cases. maybe then will push singapore to extinction.
"unreal, just like your name"
"dave choy lol, who likes their own comment?"
fear is a strange thing. they keep ranting as if the virus will go away. weak people
whats the diff between thousands of infections daily vs pandemic?

influenza cases in singapore is a lot higher than covid cases but nobody cares and live normal. why not use the same terms for that? as a malaysian i don't understand what singaporeans really want.youblame the gov if they close the border but now planning to open up andyoustill blame them. learn to move on like western countries did because our vaccination rates still higher than them
"black wolf influenza does not affect the lungs the way tb and covid do. many covid cases shown lungs damaged. i not sure if every case but many cases. your ignorance gives you the feel good bliss. you got pass o level or nots? by the way, your bliss is based on yet to be proven no loong term side effects from mrna. your habit of making feel good assumptions is amazingly amuzing"
"black wolf as a singaporean, i dont understand what malaysian really want. why come singapore to work when malaysia have work? you blame the government but still come here. we singaporeans knows our government can do a better job and you malaysians know your government can do a better job."
malaysian come here for what? whatever. it's ur own choice. nobody owns you anything.
socheezy yeah..singapore is a small tiny island no natural resources like malaysia. 🤔
msians more interested in jobs in singapore.  singaporeans more interested in shopping in msia.
think closely....

y jen actually he means about holiday too.
"of course. this is easily clearly explained : 1. a singaporerean working in singapore earning singapored 1000 is just singapored 1000. a malaysian holding pr here earns the same singapored 1000 enjoys a myr3000 intense satisfaction thus higher motivated despite being away from home. 2. such a malaysian when in singapore may ride a motorcycle. back in malaysia he drives a bmw. his colleague a singaporean earning the same rides a kup kia motorcycle not a car. cannot afford it. likewise, the malaysian is able to live in a private house back home but the poor singaporean stays in a pigeon hole till he dies. 3. the singaporean wants to spend like the malaysian can in malaysia which is dirt cheap compared to singapore. of course singaporereans love to flock there. a malaysian of course loves to work in singapore and many die die wont give up malaysia citizenship as they enjoying the benefits of have 2 country residency and privileges. if i were them i also wont be a singapore citizen. what for? there is no compelling reason to be a singapore citizen as my malaysian colleague told me before. i feel kenna suan but what to do? da peeps have spokin! last but not least, the malaysian can retire at 55 back home. the singaporerean work till 65 may not still be able to retire or afford his medical bills"

57..infection mostly age 12 to 15 as vaccination rate very low
uk has 45000+ new covid cases and 57 covid deaths! today. spore should not vtl with uk!
uk has 55000+ new covid cases today and 57 covid deaths! how. can spore has vtl with uk!
the no. of dislikes says it all....
yes. seek for medical advice. my friends doctors doesnt know wat to doing~
"the figure was by 8oct2021! by 16oct, covid deaths in spore is 224 overtaking hk’s!"
"comparison hk vs spore population 7m:5m cases 22,250:116,864 covid deaths 213:136 less cases in hk because strict border control  less deaths in spore because better medical facilities."

just open singapore 100%...! ease all restriction. restrict here and open there. 🤔😲😵🤔
yes you are right .open 100%
vtl to 🇮🇸 🇳🇴 pls.. wana go back there
"not exactly ""encouragement"", more like forcing people to vaccinate"
stop using the tagline ....underlying medical conditions....whenever there is a covid related death .....23 years old .....underlying medical conditions?....just admit he died because of covid.....thats it .....
不怕死的就来吧！😡🤬😡  just when we are running out of hospital beds ?
we are not running out of hospital beds. it's a strain on our front line workers as there are more work but beds availability okay  that's why g asked you to vaccinate
"tourists in should not be using singapore public hospitals, tourists should pay for their own stay in private hospital with better services."
eric km  they will bring their own portable hospitals here. our hospitals are for our entitled race.dont worry 😟
coshinc . 😂😂😂give singapore private hospitals some business also.  singapore tax payer should pay for tourist hospital bill.
vtl approved! then please reopen geylang too!
in a hurry? cannot wait already?  ask the oppies
why would any tourist wanna come here now.. with 2 pax restrictions. just go full endemic already.
"when they come, we will revert to 5 pax or 8pax. be practical. fatality rate at 0.2% is well praised by the world"
they should not let those who are below 12y.o fly. if the parents want to fly with their kids who are un-vax they should be on a non vtl flight. what if the children are the carrier of the virus.
here we go. disastrous!
we are doing very well.98.6% are mild and asymptomatic.  no cause for worrying  here death rate is 0.2% while indonesia is 3.4% maybe this will be helpful to you
living with covid is like sleeping with enemy!
it's true even if you don't like it. complain to who? the whole world is in the same situation.  let mortally come back with a bit of reality and less fear
justfair take your pfizer and moderna  every 6 months so that you can live with covid virus!
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures.  may be time to do better and have more humanity.
history tell us......................live with the virus.............slowly wait the virus die
sat fever  not bad if our country can still afford
please open for singapore - batam as well please
😂😂😂😂😂😂
"with the current speed of spreading, soon there will be new singaporepap variant"
"if it has to be, let it be. 98.6 of infections are mild or asymptomatic  it's going to treated as a flu if we are smart enough to be pragmatic"
"the problem is singapore's doctor's make fun of or take for a joke when a patient sincerely questions about vaccination side effects even after getting the vaccination. so, good luck requesting people to opt for boosters. change the attitude of healthcare professionals. make data available publicly of reported side effects. then, people might consider."
you are feigning ignorance.  how to push that thing into your brain?
"hooray! looking forward to travel again, it is worth to take pcr test n quarantine when home if holidaying in first world countries👍 not 3rd world countries👎"
i actually thought they were hitting a devious lick in the thumbnail
i giveyoua predictio. soon there will be cag cluster.
"gov say singapore for sale,we need people to spend money if not gov no end year bonus salary and next year no budget.overpaid minister salary and no one is asking question about it,even more than the usa president and russian president.china and hong kong is still doing a 0 covid 19 policy ,singapore gov is just lazy now and try to twist and change words,say can live covid 19 is safe.minister order people at the btm to work ,but junior doctor and nurse say i resign- i have not seen the daylight for weeks. minister just eye power ,only look at data ."
you are right. we should pay our ministers more. they work so hard day and night.
"eh you so scared of covid that your fear can feed you and your family no need to put food on the table okay lah? just because you okay with living in fear like that doesn’t mean everyone have to follow you okay. you scared you ownself lock yourself at home, don’t stop other people from carrying on with life.  we already been doing everything we can to fight covid and for so long. if covid last 100 years, 100 years you want people to self quarantine at home, cannot go to work, cannot eat freely, cannot go out, cannot travel is it?"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfhuewnfah8&t=01m28s01:28 is there a mistake? on clearing arrival immigration and on-arrival pcr test at changi airport, i thought travellers must commute directly to their declared self-isolation accommodation (by private transport, taxi, or private hire car) and must self-isolate there until they are notified of a negative pcr test result. so how can travellers interact with families/general public and get picked up by them at arrival hall?"
pcr
i am confused and naive. ask me to go here and go there. vaccines and vaccines and 3rd booster vaccines. when the 4th vaccines... due to mistakes.. moh.. pls explain. i am vaccinated and naive. go in and out... still naive. 💯🤑😩😩🙄👀
ergk er  what mistakes are you talking about? vietnam a growing country has only less than 5% vaccination rate. reason? country has no money here you are making noise for having everything placed nicely for you. be grateful lah
"if only they have been bothered to listen to the plights and sufferings of fellow singaporeans, they would have acquired the skill-sets and critical knowledge in dealing with real issues and challenges on the ground much more effectively.   instead, the pap government prefers to pride itself for having mastered the arts in skillfully ignoring the plights and sufferings of fellow singaporeans, and the skill in instilling fear in them to comply and behave. some even have the audacity to even ask fellow singaporeans to leave the country if they are not happy.   remember those audacious pap politicians?   but foreign workers from china, india and other larger economies are no pushovers as incidents like this and the little india riot have shown us.  in the face of adversity, they have learnt to unite in solidarity.   it is precisely because they are able to unite to voice out their concerns against the shortcomings of their government and that is keeping their governments on their toes.   in this incident, we can see how this correlation is at work when the chinese embassy in singapore was prompted into addressing the plights and concerns of their citizens with our authorities.   has socialist-china become more democratic and citizen-centric than us?   yes, we may be “first world” and a democracy but where are we when it comes to addressing social injustice against fellow singaporeans and the never-ending governmental failures these days?   having witnessed how those chinese workers from a socialist country like china are smart in using social disobedience to civilly garner public attention to their plight after being forced to their breaking point, what does it says about us?   are singaporeans overly submissive or have we become a nation of pushovers?   it is important for every singaporean to be asking ourselves this vital question because if we are indeed overly submissive and/or has become a nation of pushovers, then we must not blame the 4g pap politicians for our miseries and sufferings, and take full responsibility for it.   until this vital question is addressed reflectively by more singaporeans, there is simply no reason in asking if singaporeans deserve better…"
"yusuf best , nothing to do about pushover?  ok, so were those thousands in the recent dormitory fracas pushovers compared to singaporeans?"
"bro, even if diff party comes in  power, nothing will change.... diplomats will be diplomats .... singapore is space constraint and highly dependent on import than export... so try to understand and   develop the right skill!!!"
"maatraam,  only the generations of the future will experience the destiny of this little island which was part of malaysia- where all if not most of your so called dips or politicians come from.  if you think this can all last forever, you're not standing back far enough to see the really big picture."
"will this complaint by joseph nathan fall in death ears? the mismanagement buck must stop at the 4g ministers or even the pm. by joseph nathan another wave of embarrassment as mom mismanages its pandemic protocols, yet again: the latest fracas between foreign workers and the authorities at the 3,400-bedder westlite dormitory at jalan tukang marks another sad day for singapore when video footages of their plights were widely circulated on weixin, the localized version of wechat in china, and was subsequently reported on several international news.   with many being unvaccinated and not provided with access to medical support, and when a quarter of its residents tested positive for covid-19, the fear of infection or even death can be terrifying for many of these workers.   being locked-up in a prison-like facility while being unable to survive on the poor quality of food, and as complaints of food hygiene start surfacing, the whole incident is just like a ticking time-bomb waiting to explode.   bad behaviour, bad faith, bad precedent:   it is extremely troubling that even a major employer like sembcorp marine, who is a glc, was not even bothered to act with urgency in addressing the concerns and plights of their foreign workers despite the explicit assurance given by pm lee to families of foreign workers that they have nothing to be worried about as his government will take good care of them. did they take their assurances seriously?   this was despite the manpower and health ministries having set up a health protocols for dormitory operators after earlier pandemic outbreaks, and it begets a question - why isn’t the operator or sembcorp marine complying with these health and safety regulations?   if only they had acted in good faith given that 1,400 beds at the dormitory were occupied by sembcorp marine’s workers, singapore would not have been embarrassed by this latest incident.   as for worms found in their food, where is nea and sfa when they are needed to address a serious food hygiene lapse by the appointed food caterer?   to make matters worse, it is purely incomprehensible as to why the ministers of manpower and the home affairs have to prematurely mobilize the riot police if their intention is to engage and assure the workers.   in so doing, the heavy presence of armoured riot police and vehicles from the special operations command shows their lack of sincerity in addressing the concerns and plights of the workers and gives an impression that massive force may be used against them if they do not cooperate with the authorities.   as the tertified workers are already crying out for help to convey infected workers to recovery facilities, shouldn’t our authorities be sending ambulances and doctors instead of these armoured vehicles and riot police? in good faith, why can't these ""forces"" be stationed discreetly some distance away so as not to further terrify an already terrified group of workers? are we giving our government too much power and is this wise? what if a few of our ministers were to go rogue and start using these ""forces"" on fellow singaporeans over petty issues?   the whole incident shows just how our government has been tolerating the bad behavious at our ministries and glcs, and just how troubling precedents are being set for all the wrong reasons when bad faith becomes entrenched as the new normal in our government.   this incident clearly reflects several major systemic failures across our ministries, and unless more effort is put into managing potential risks and issues at our dormitories, more embarrassments will be coming our way soon.    wider implications:   by adopting an attitude of arrogance in being outright dismissive of constructive criticisms and feedbacks, the 4g pap politicians have yet again embarrassed the good name of singapore."
vtl approved!!! but why casual football/ futsal cannot? when?!!!
as soon as more unvaccinated get their jabs do some persuasion please

jane marie fuentes  the impression is mutual.  so funny and senseless that i can't believe what i am reading

"covid-vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine-sulfate. covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated. peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak."
prepare for more travellers = prepare for more case
you like to stay closed? why are worrying so much?
fiost well singapore a few weeks ago daily cases were only a few hundred but now it's a few thousand a day. so prepare for heavier restrictions soon.
not a cat  they may put in some restrictions to protect the hospitals from overwhelming but opening will be the way to move forward. vtl with 11 countries are signed. it will ultimately be good for spore to open up
then blame higher cases to the unvax..really shite 🤬
maria maria  get this right they didn't blame the unvaccinated for cases. they just feel heart pain so many unnecessary deaths for unvaccinated
"i hope by end of the year all restrictions moved. no more mask, social distancing etc. let’s just live our lives normally. stop using covid to control us. people die every day from many things. cant stop people living just because you might die from covid. die from smoking, ban cigarettes? die in car accident, ban vehicles? most people who get covid wont die, just a runny nose. no need to got o hospital. stay home, then hospital cases go down, then we can open up."
yeah right
desperate
better open border
and here we go...
"i think the job the local media does to explain the situation, the facts, actions and scientific background is not good enough. the professor uses much too much words for explaining that all incoming travellers are vaxxed and tested, and how this reduces the risk. you had also to mention that all these countries have already liberated their travelling, and they have mostly a lower new infection rate as compared to singapore, because their local transmissions are half and lesser than the number that singapore currently has. so if risk - then it's rather true they risk something by coming here."
be prepare the worst case yet to come. life or money?
don't be a fear monger. do not worry too much
fiost how is that fear mongering? are you gaslighting?
fr0zed heebie-jeebies 🤣🤣
money.

"george xu  yes, tell the xenophon here."
"we have been fighting covid for so long. lock down, vaccination, no dine in, only vaccinated can dine in, non vaccinated cannot go shopping mall, yet the covid cases still go up.  this is not normal, we can’t live like this forever. we need to go back to normalcy, people also need to feed themselves and their families. if covid 100 years then people one whole lifetime cannot travel cannot live normally because you scared this scared that lah?!"
kai yin  well said. we have to face it and live normally. saving lives and protecting livelihoods. hope the unvaccinated will do their part so that spore can open more easily
"kai yin exactly, singaporeans gotta realise singapore earns its money & therefore have reserves to feed their ass by being an economic open country. we are not big like china that can self sustain even under closed borders. those who still hv their job & wfh will lose their job sooner or later if we continue closing borders. singapore is highly educated but many still do not realise this. 书白读了 wasted all their years studying."
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures.  may be time to do better and have more humanity.
banana monkey allergy  most are deliberately ignorant to spite the govt. they do not understand that a country like spore has no natural resources and is dependent on our links to the world as a global hub. closing will not only harm spore now but will have long term irreversible damage. they must understand that no one owes spore a living. and our bread must come from outside spore because there is nothing here
kai yin it will be useful if we all know whats the underlying problems for the people who pass on from covid so people with these underlying problems can avoid going out more often .. thus helping save lives
justfair hahaha i like ur word ignorant. they've been sheltered by the country for their whole lives & naively thinks the govt has infinite reserves & resources to support the entire singapore economy & give payouts all the time till covid is over. the bankruptcy of construction companies resulting in incomplete btos already is a very worrying sign. even the govt unable to help them. what makes them think they can continue helping singaporeans in the long run with borders kept closed huh. dumb fks that complain whole day but nv see them coming up with better solutions.
"nic yeo  i think if you read enough, then you would know that what are the underlying conditions. the experts and mtf had said countless times"
justfair new underlying conditions can emerge isnt it . not just the ones that we know . it is good to state what are the underlying problems for each of the death cases
mohan sinnapillay still believe in conspiracy theory? who has already dismissed this statement and there are still idiots who believe that human technology is so advanced? if humans can create virus we should have already migrated to mars
banana monkey allergy  well said  and insightful 👍👍

si dunue  wuhan virus is the parent. go n ask xi why he hide.
"si dunue  racist ah bengs fails to understand that while delta started in india, it also appeared in china which has blanket ban on indians. they gave frivolous excuses that russian pilots brought it which was refuted. can you xenopbic ah beng use your brain which is largely used for crooked ways?"
"si dunue  i am least bothered on your lies. seen enough xenophobic ah bengs in recent days. so nothing to be surprised. yes delta variant started in india. india dont deny or lie like china. there were few other variants before that too. my sister caught covid from her chinese colleague. we dont stigmatise like some ugly people with low values. indeed its wuhan virus that transcended into alpha n delta n so forth. not bad. for once china produced a durable product that makes the world turn. just wait n see, how the world treat you guys."
good 7 month over now open again how delta coming in the apply for permit to come prof dont talk too much cock he think variety show like to clown said can be 10 thousand per day
"my current worry is...will singapore have our very own mutated variant? if yes, when will it surface? mutated variant usually happened in countries that open and let covid grow freely. some expert claimed that it is unlikely that covid will mutate further giving scientific explanations. but who knows?"
"i won’t be surprised if we do , given how dumb and stupid the government is"
"seal young north korea also close, why we going to open?"

"""cases"" is pretty much meaningless - who (finally) admits pcr tests create false positives"
sho nuf  a lot of countries cut down testing.  just use art will do
"coshinc probably best to stop the testing altogether, unless someone is actually sick.  the rest is just meant to induce fear."
sho nuf  it will make a lot of sense since we are living in an endemic. i know the g is still concerned about the unvaccinated. i believe there is only much a leader can do
coshinc if they are so concerned they should stop treating them like second class people.  natural immunity is real.
sho nuf  however we need to take care of the hospital resources too
"everyday citizens dying and getting younger and these leaders just let it be, no sound no words... they just let ppl die everyday while actively welcoming foreigners into our country without quarantine. what if those foreigners bring in a mutated deadly version of covid that is resistance to the vaccine?  low chance does not mean no chance... if that happens, we will see thousands of death everyday. god bless singaporeans. they are assuming the virus does  not mutate.. assumptions is the mother of all f-ups."

"a lot of international university students from south asian countries are suffering as they cannot enter singapore due to the travel restrictions. these countries (nepal, bangladesh, sri lanka) and even others are doing exceptionally well with all nearly of them recording less that 700 cases daily. we understand that it may be risky to open a vtl lane, but perhaps consider letting them enter through a two week quarantine lane after being fully vaccinated? their final exams are being held in-person physically, they may not be able to sit for them if the restrictions continue. please understand their situation."
not at the moment please. we are not ready to received students.
"no, for tourist and business men now only."
"singapore hospital beds not enough, students have to wait 6 months for singapore covid situation to improve."
"eric phua theres only a handful of students that come in yearly from the blocked countries, less than 15-20. if they are fully vaccinated + after quarantine for two weeks, what more do you want? by your logic letting in tourists and businessmen (who are larger in number) is more dangerous....."
"hei dei . but the return is more. businessmen if they get covid, will pay for their own hospital fee in private hospital that can amount to usd 30k to 50k for treatment. they will not tax our public hospital. singapore privates hospital can also make some revenue."
"eric km its not right to assume all of these 20 odd students that would come in will get covid...even if they do they are likely to have mild/no symptoms and can recover at home (like the 98.6% cases in singapore) as they are fully vaccinated. you have missed my point entirely though, entry for students is open for students from countries with higher covid numbers, some even have vtl lanes, but south asian countries ie- nepal, bangladesh, sri lanka etc. are blocked off completely even though their case numbers are much lower...."
"hei dei . i did say the students will get covid. but nobody can say for sure right? anyone including myself might get it, just a  matter of time.  i just say the singapore vtl countries businessmen have the abilities to pay for their own private hospitalization in case they down with covid delta plus."
eric km yes but i am referring to students....why are students from vtl countries allowed to enter (when they even have higher covid cases) and not the south asian countries i mentioned before?
"hei dei . because these advance countries also give singapore students free scholarship (in their countries) in exchange. just wait patiently, when singapore covid situation improved, we will have vtl with more countries. we are now busy work vtl with countries like japan, switzerland, qatar, dubai (uae), oman. it take time."
eric km yes i understand what you mean. i just hope that singapore will allow quarantined travel for us if a vtl is not possible.
"hei dei about:invalid#zcsafez 9 more deaths as singapore reports 3,348 new covid-19 cases today. touch wood, if anything bad happen to the foreign students if they here, people will condemns singapore for it. we prefer to be safe than sorry."
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures.  may be time to do better and have more humanity.

"fr nov 1st 2021, australia is allowing  only australian, prs and families back into the country without quarantine.  australian pm  made a clarification after nsw premier's announcement."
"may i suggest to ban the unvax from hospital? or at least give them a choice to choose between getting vax or will be ban from hospital treating covid related matters. and if must admit to hospital unvax, there will be extra $5000 fine to be paid first. but all these under 1 condition, that the unvax remain unvax for life without any mandate to be vax for life. since this is about protecting the unvax and not discriminating or punishing at the same time saving hospital resources. i assume the unvax will be able to do laundry, go to school, go to work, eat, do all things normally except going to hospital with covid related illness as above. and put a stop to any discrimination towards the unvax by stopping the mandate of anything into the unvax body for life. then we can coexist sincerely and happily. lets reach a compromise and collaboration. this exchange of banned from covid related hospital vaccine treatment is voluntary exchange for living a normal life without restrictions again.dvv"
very different oh god
once you are vexsinated be it  partial two doses (fully) booster plus your risk of getting infected is very high  as the vexsin carries the virus toxin
"covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from infection or fully vaccinated.  covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the variant."

"sacrificing people lives? people die everyday. there is no escape from death. your love ones will die one day and my loved ones will die one day.  i will die one day and you will die one day. i agree to opening up. in fact i think singapore opening up is too slow , too little. if it is up to me, i will remove all this shitty quarantine requirements and remove all covid 19 rules by now. no more masks, no quarantines, no covid 19 rules since  majority will recover without long term side effects or serious side effects."
"lai fong chan so, just who is not telling the truth in its entirety?  lw said ""sooner or later, many of us will end up catching the virus, but we will have zero or mild symptoms (and) recover from home after a few days"".  from prof leo [executive director ncid]; ""basically, we do not know ten years, twenty years down the line. which strategy gives you the best, we don't know, and i think the important thing to know is that we do know how the covit19 virus can damage the body, and the effect can be long lasting although we don't see it, so we don't know the price that you pay, the immediate price versus the longer-term price."""
"we can’t eradicate travelling forever. that is not living. we already been fighting this for so long in every way possible, yet numbers still go up. people still need to feed themselves you know. you want everyone to go bankrupt then you happy is it?!"
"kai yin people are dying and you are worshipping the devil. maybe you agree your parents and your kids to be added to the counts to wake up your ideas since everyday also got people up lorry, right? otherwise you know that your reasoning is plain silly and unacceptable. healthy farmers can re-farm and rebuild the land while sick farmers will likely all up lorries. zero covid strategy like new zealand, china and hong kong and then rebuild later. that appears to be the logical and proven and the only way. currently you are forsaking the lives of the citizens, that's about all and when situation are really bad, who guarantees that they will not forsaken and abandon you? wake up your idea !"
kai yin and then do get a proper education. the subject addresses the requirement of pcr test certainty and the importance of the quarantine period specifically quarantine period is required to assure safety for the country and also to mitigate the spread of the c19 .
"kai yin as i have said multiples of times before; vaccination should never have been used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. stop the imports from higher-risk countries and the leaks into the communities. safe guard the life-safety of all singaporeans, particularly the younger ones, elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority."
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures.  may be time to do better and have more humanity.
"the prof should stop singing underlying medical condition as excuses - common as ingrown toenail, sprain, dysmenorrhoea ? etc. please be professional, relevant and useful to mitigate the rising numbers of deaths in singapore.  singapore may have done better without these so call ""experts"", i think."
yes. who above the age 50 does not have any underlying medical conditions. even the most of young adults today all have underliying medical conditions.
"david sum obesity, high blood pressure and cardiac problems can be reasons. if they are under control there is little need to worry about people below 80 yo, and in particular, if the person is fully vaccinated. people above 80 yo have generally a much weaker immune system. therefore, it is even more important to bring these conditions under control and avoid the person has to fight the disease plus the virus. do not believe these fake apostles, do believe in science."
should be more precise so people with these conditions can avoid going out often. that will help the citizens alot
"nic yeo many of these like hypertension, obesity or cardiac problems require long term medical therapy. you would be surprised how many do not follow the instructions given by uncle doc."
peter kroll thats why should disclose the underlying problems for those who pass on because of covid . so people with such underlying problems can avoid going out often and that saves lives
"nic yeo i forgot to mention diabetes to hypertension, obesity or cardiac problems. these 4."
peter kroll if so many of us with underlying health issue which caused death government should have know better not to expose us to covid.
"fr0zed it is not ""so many"". singapore has one of the lowest fatalities in the world. also, these health problems do not go away by itself. they are vulnerable."
peter kroll lowest fatalities only means we got good healthcare system which when over capacity don't mean a thing anymore.
"fr0zed one of the best healthcare systems in the world, and this is not the usual ""singapore is the best"" marketing burp. at this moment there are 44 people in icu. there are about 300 icu units available. at that rate, german's health minister would lean back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, and say: cool! but here people run around like headless chicken."
peter kroll i myself do not know what singapore is doing. on one hand they restrict singaporeans movement to socialized on the other hand did not restrict incoming travel passengers. i think   it's fine if someone tells me the increase in number of cases does not increase the number of icu and hospital bed been occupied. but it does increase those two number does it?
"fr0zed the government argues that the incoming travelers via vtl are only people who are vaccinated and tested. most singaporeans are vaccinated but not tested. at this moment the actual data is on their side, as the vast majority of transmission are community transmissions, therefore community restrictions. are needed. i do however agree it is enough by now, the ""carefulness"" seems somewhat overboard. if the entire family is vaxxed then there is not much reason they can not go together, anywhere."
peter kroll precisely. i get it that some of the population is not yet vaccinated and  will be of the higher risk group as compare to those vaccinated. but if that's the case why some seem free of the restriction while others are not?
money or life. no money no life. what's the point of life without lots of money?
"but whenyoulose ur life, its too late to realise its not always abt money."
wat's the point having money but die faster! wit money sometimes no life too.
"got money, no life. at least you can let your children use the money."
"yes you are right, we can’t eradicate travelling forever. that is not living. we already been fighting this for so long in every way possible, yet numbers still go up. people still need to feed themselves."
"shadostorm if covid last for 100 years and you have to quarantine at home for a lifetime and have no money to buy food to feed yourself or your family, what is life about?"
♠️lovely free soul♠️ you never know when you will die. you could die tomorrow of a heart attack while staying at home also you don’t know. what is the point of living like this on the last remaining day of your life? scared this scared that. that is not living either.
kai yin live our life in a righteous part....... god will bless our journey regardless whether we ar rich or poor! you can't buy life wit money!
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures.  may be time to do better and have more humanity.
"in singapore, not only the elderly succumbed to the virus. it was reported that a partially vaccinated 23-year-old individual and 34 years old had succumbed to the virus on 14 oct 2021."
"moh should stop stating half-baked useless ""excuses"" for example, underlying medical condition as the medical condition could have been caused by the virus itself or as common as ingrown toenail, sprain, dysmenorrhoea etc. please be professional, relevant and useful to mitigate the rising numbers of deaths in singapore."

"singapore future damn you're so fragile af that you want the big daddy government to shut up opposing views so that you can protect your fee-fees. i would pity you, but i'd rather laugh at sheep who outright refuse to use their brains to question anything at all. if singapore can have any sort of future with people like you, all i can say is good luck."
​asada  offering a different opinion is not stating defamations as what ttkoh does. that is falsehood.
"peter kroll by <b>your</b> logic then (and presuming the government has a similar stand too), anything that doesn't fit the mainstream narrative or what the authorities want you to think instead could be taken as ""defamation"" or ""falsehoods"". please do enlighten me, which other country that isn't an authoritarian hellhole sues their citizens over wrongthink while earning obscene amounts of money at the cost of the people? sure, mr. ""ttkoh"" here <i>may</i> not be coherent in his comments (since he's kinda spamming them everywhere), but he does somehow have a point. if this one-party-rules-all system continues well into the future, that said ruling party, in their powers, can use all sorts of coercion to silence any opposing thoughts, views or anyone that simply questions the mainstream narrative. it may not happen now, but eventually with covid being used as an excuse here and there to do all sorts of incomprehensible crap, it's becoming more of a reality than a fringe conspiracy theory."
"asada thank you mr asada. for a single news, st would segment into multiple segments and in each segment contains various subjects. as long as my replies are factual or relevant and befitting to the situation and serving to help the community and complying to the st online policy, i think it should be acceptable. but thanks for your advice,  i will trim to avoid being accuse of spamming. i am delighted to see today, so many like minded people sharing the same views to improve the situation for the benefits and life-safeties for all singaporeans. regards;"

singapore future it's true that current covid vaccine do not offer immunity to virus and does not even reduce the infection rate. it only lesser the severity of the illness. it's people like you which confirm that pofma must be repeal.

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
"besides malaysians that stay in jb and come to work in singapore daily, there is another group of singaporeans who stay in jb that needs to come to work in singapore and return to jb daily. please allow land vtl gurantine free travel both ways for this group too, especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only 2 or less passengers or upto 4 paxs if they are immediate family members. all vaccinated. also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in jb should be facilitated to allow 2 way vtl gurantine free land travel soonest possible. this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over 20 months now just because they couldn't return to their jb homes."

"don't open vtl by land to malaysians! they earn salary here but they don't contribute back to our economy in the form of tax or rental income. they don't rent accommodation or even spend much here and rather spend hours travelling to and fro malaysia to earn singapore dollars. by not allowing vtl, they will be forced to continue renting accommodation and spending on daily necessities here, like other foreigners from other countries. this will be beneficial to singapore economy."
pls wait till 2025.
no such thing. they are rich.

"jiel cm want to go to other countries and make use of theirs system to earn money, always comes with a price. nothing new."
this is fair to singaporeans that malaysian workers have to stay here. their spending  while making a living in singapore serves to benefit singaporeans too.
but singapore is already over populated. by keeping malaysians workers staying here it will just lead to higher housing price!!!

pay the cost for the risks for both countries. before  that required to open vtl now said costly.

jimmy tan go get a proper education in english comprehension first.
"14 more up lorries with 91,425 infected individuals over the last 28 days [total accumulated unknown, hr numbers unknown]. strictly speaking, the above results do not warrant them to further gamble and risk doing away with quarantine or anything seen to be risking than mitigating. infact a coi should be convened to investigate the mounting failures / poor performance. basing on gky 4th may 2020 ministerial statement as a benchmark, the above result is a crying shame for such a small country like singapore. well, some may not be happy but face the fact."

why go on a witch hunt on rk's case and waste value resources instead on concentrating on the pandemic?  look now we have omicron cases at the airport. we should close our border for the time being. money can be earned later. please have a heart for singaporeans.

why want to invite all the troubles n hassles onto oneself just for that day trip across the causeway .?

"some of the singaporean might not be so happy about the government, of course they have a lot to improve, but compare with hk government, they have done a lot better ."
so risk to malaysians going back to jb is not the same as risk to singaporeans going to jb for shopping?
consider very carefully???u just decided to embrace herd immunity band flung the doors wide open allowing more than a few hundred thousand cases of covid in the last few months and nearly 1000 cases in icu......all for the sake of ur economic growth at all cost and cheaper better faster population ponzi economy.....youtreated millions of human lives as literally nothing but animals for the slaughter......and ur telling us to consider carefully?????is there any limit to ur shamelessness and hubris and hypocrisy?i'm starting to consider maybe the ccp government might be more humane when looking at their own people.

"please la, just because he said dont go,then we dont go? if so worried,then closed off the vtl la. if not just wait for things to unfold and we will see how our capable government handle it."
"the day singaporeans rise up   that is the day all this nonsense will stop. this people will keep on holdingyoupeople , keep enslavingyoupeople while they enrich their pockets through this  plandemic coz all this virus its all plan to continue to push the vaccine ."
dont go lah for the moment. only really important then go. support local business first.
correct.
we want to support local businesses but cannot. not only do businesses need our money they also demand we be vaccinated.
a very responsible and capable s'pore govt. great advice!
"aiyah try not to come jb shopping, come only if necessary or important like if you have family here or if you have business here. simple."
all these mtfucker's kids better be the first to do the vac before asking nation's kids to go ahead. anyway no matter any bad happen will be heavily paid for free or subsidize or compensate. life doesn't matter to them also. $ come first right.
i wish they were as serious as handling the lies in rk case
"seriouslyyoucare about rk issue alot? hahahaha that one pap plot it so that people will,forget co,vid and then destroy all opposition so that people will not vote. i see one dumb girl make wrong al people forget how many kinds of mistake pap also did ? first of all co vid is not over there is cases here n pap what they doing they don't care because foriengers not effected they getting revenue if foreigners got many,cases they sure closed all n ,safegaurd so from here we can see. they keep saying economy then why last year circuit breaker. many death ready in singapore still open freely incompetent need,vote them out in next election. i don't care rk case. they wasted 9 hours in pritam singh get nothing instead netizen laughing at pap now especial the cop n people supporting wp after thatyousee it really hit back pap a lot. they nerd get rid of shanmugam that guy keep finding fault. if rk did wrong she should be in court or morever she resign ready so ok done. why keep dragging. edwin tong potential law minister useless he look like the ah boy to men recruit nerdy guy hahahahaha"

"why give yourself stress when pandemiic is not totally over, you jolly well know"
go ubin better more relaxed
"does anyone really think pandemic will ever be over?  already say get comfortable living with virus yet we open boarder to have even more intensive test when when boarder is close for what.  either way government has no idea what to do when new version come out each time, now got omnicron what is next decepticon?"
it won't be over.what is the nbr they are looking
albert ng why numbers matter ?
daniel leong so close border and let people live in hunger is that what you want ?
boba fett do you understand what i am trying to say instead of trying to think what i am saying. all this time i am saying stupid idea of singapore govt to put so much restrictions as mentioned virus never end so why stupid to put so many restrictions especially with vtl still swap everyday and minister still say even if vtl is there better not go. so please be clear i do not believe closing boarder is going to be solution neither is 7 days self art test with two days at supervised locations  what happen you get infected at supervised locations who you think pay for quarantine at hotel. so be clear to all who is reading and i am not for close borders i lost my job 2 years ago due to close border
daniel leong so will all this measures be effective when recent news reported that sinovac jab is not effective enough to fend off omicron so whats the next step now ?
"boba fett why ask me i want to travel also but without the need for 7 days swap (inclusive of 2 days supervised swap) at other country and 7 days swap  (inclusive of 2 days supervised swap) when back in singapore, ask the government so called expert who tell us asymtomatic no need to wear mask now we know it was because there was supply shortage.  also for sinovac it is something my friends and relative in china do not want to take due to side effects and so many here want to take.  nothing to say."
daniel leong my advice is better dont do any travelling at this period cos omicron is still looming and all that testings are so hassling and can be confusing.
than we shown the kindness
looks who’s talking? the so called task force.  i will be very very worried if they remain to be mps after the next election.
what is he try to say tai chi round the circle.
no balls that’s why.
shut up lah
"be careful, be very careful. you never know what you will bring back. wahhahaha....."

for the sake of business and family..i willingly to take the risk.
but your family willing to take risk for you or not ?
boba fett yes we all vaccinated and no underlying medical condition.

dee bu soh if you dont think deep then how are you going to be prepared ?
"boba fett i trust spore mtf, if happen then say ."
"correct, cannot scared covid until forever quarantine never live life to the fullest. simple measures are enough. wear a mask, wash your hands, stay 1 meter distance away from each other."

"singaporeans shall not take booster until all 3 demands are met. 1. legislation on the maximum number of booster required to be recognized as a fully vaccinated person in singapore(ideally not more than 4). 2. a cash payout of singapored500 for each booster taken as compensation for taking on risk of vaccination. 3. removal of all vaccination differentiated measures in singapore. my fellow singaporeans, join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the pap. to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one, use the 3 finger salute to signal that you are part of this cause. the day when everyone in public openly uses the 3 finger salute, it is time for a revolution. revolution of our times."

"vaccinated people get covid and spread it too. they are no different than unvaccinated people, except they may not get severe covid, but some still do. a test is a test. either test people and let them in, or quarantine everyone coming in.  this is less about prevention than government control."

"person a feels that they need to vaccinate to be protected, so they get vaccinated; however, person a doesn't feel protected unless person b also gets the vaccine. and if person b refuses to get the vaccine, person a shames them until they do. let's take this a step further. person a, who is vaccinated, can still catch and transmit the virus, but is not subjected to going through daily/weekly testing. person b, who is not vaccinated, and who can catch and transmit the virus, has to go through daily/weekly testing and potential quarantine. why does person a not have to go through testing and quarantine if they can still catch and transmit the virus and to go even further than that: person a is vaccinated and, even though they can catch and transmit the virus, can walk into any number of locations that state they will only allow the vaccinated inside. person b is not vaccinated and, even though they may test negative for the virus, are not allowed inside any of the locations that state they will only allow the vaccinated inside. wanna piece this together now? it boils simply down to segregation and discrimination with no real basis for doing so: 1.  person a is vaccinated. 2.  person b is not vaccinated. 3.  both person a and person b can catch and transmit the virus. 4.  person a does not have to get tested, but person b does. 5.  person a can go wherever they want, but person b cannot. 6.  person a is allowed to live their lives, while person b cannot. 7.  person a perpetuates the shaming of person b by stating that person b needs to be vaccinated for person a to be protected. so with person a constitute 90% while person b only 10% of the spore population, what would be the eventual outcome ? please share you views here."

"how russian citizens smashed the silly moscow vaccination passports in just 3 weeks. this is how mayor sobyanin's vaccine passport was smashed - and it was pretty straightforward.  moscow residents simply stopped going to any business that required a vaccine passport. the most beautiful thing about all this is that the vaccinated showed solidarity with the unvaccinated.  the business was reduced almost to zero in all the establishments in which the vaccination passport was required. muscovites grew their hair out, stopped going to bars and restaurants, didn't go to the movies, stayed in hotels, or did anything that required a vaccination passport. businessmen across the city suddenly called mayor sobyanin's office to scold him for the vaccination passports. they were ruining themselves and they were very angry about it. marina zemskova, director of a regional hotel and restaurant association in russia, said the vaccine passport turned out to be worse for the business than a total shutdown.  at least, if there were another shutdown, she points out, the businesses ""could count on some kind of supportive measures from the government."" with a vaccine passport system there is no government support.  what the not very elitist elites did not foresee about the residents of moscow was that they simply would not participate in the scam at all. the businessmen were so enraged at the mayor that sobyanin made a sudden and surprising announcement on july 19 that it was no longer necessary for anyone to use the vaccine passport.  a hilarious excuse was made, claiming that covid case rates had suddenly improved, as a reason to lift qr code passports. but everyone knew the truth. the muscovites decided that their medical privacy and their right to travel are more important than what the officials told them. it was a massive case of civil disobedience, and they didn't even have to go outside and set things on fire in a big protest. all they did was say, ""any business that wants to see a vaccine passport from me is not going to get any of my money."" this is how you do it. 👏👏👏 pls share."

flight travels is the real culript for health care system collapse.
"at 90% icu limit,  still opening wider?   thats suicidal.     where is their common sense?  whoever introduced and approved this nonsense is seriously clueless and disconnect !!!"

what they should have shown are the ground zero where healthcare workers are struggling to keep up with the increase of patients so that the citizen understand their struggle and keep in mind to follow the measures strictly. but no they show this
yay can’t wait to die soon
pandemic. rich can travel. poor cant even eat woth family becauss of max capacity dine in at 2. travellers still welcome. vaccinated discriminated against unvaccinated. we deserve to perish.
cna must be desperate to hire instagrammers for a news segment
how much extra did they pay?
thisisjustadrama
distasteful reporting. the standard of cna reporting has leveled to the gutter.
i have noticed that lately
<b>hong kong</b> population: 7.5 million.  no of covid cases: 7  (24 sep 2021) average over last 7 days:  3 cases vaccination: 57%  <b>singapore</b> population: 5.7 million. no of cases: 1650  (24 sep 2021) average over last 7 days: 1247 cases. vaccination: 82%  source: csse john hopkins university  why the huge difference?
hk is right to burst the hk-sin travel buddle coiled by the useless ong. simply love hk and their effectual governance.

why is singapore pap govt screening lavish europe lifestyle traveling during a pandemic where people are losing job?
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
what happened to pap's promise of the promised to open up after 80% vaccination?
perverted action party
i will laugh when germany start to have covid-19 infections or the travellers get covid
yaya dont cry on ig whenyouget covid
"the part i can't understand: being safe from what? 😄 young, healthy, vaccinated person, should be safe from what?"
"fake testkit, fake number. anything also get"
next door neighbour such as indonesia and malaysia are being shut off. germany open. singapore promoting to attract ft via their new plan of covid 19 green lanes.
this is outrageous... shut at home for commoners and travel pass for the rich/elite/highend.. we are treated as fool in our homeland.
this is ridiculous! the interview is basing europe like it’s a war zone!
why 3x the dislikes 👎👎👎
when you have a dog mediayouonly get propaganda news
please report if they happen to die
"guys, please do not be sold by the word safe. they should have people communicating this, she's a traveller not a medical expert. so just an advice hope this would help more people. declaration: im not a medical expert too. but i'll wear a mask at all public places."
when vaccinated singaporean cannot even eat outside with family of 5. group of 6 vaccinated travellers can go to germany for holiday. isnt that weird?
don come back being test positive
wah. go out of singapore. you are saved liao.
"hopefully they can open up lanes to more countries soon, especially europe, korea, new zealand, australia and possibly hokkaido in japan where it is more rural."
"just a very honest and curious question here, not making fun of anybody here, do singaporeans pronounce ""tr"" as "" ch""? like ""chravelling"" instead of ""travelling""?"
"ridiculous to allow imports in under vtl to gallivant all over spore but impose severe restrictions on own locals.   13, 19 imported cases reported on 2 days last week. new variants like mu will or may already have arrived"
"just open up la… seriously this virus have a fatality of 0.05%, and 99% can recover at home. for 0.05%, you are willing to decimate the entire economy and eat up all our reserves? it takes common sense to know that we are overreacting to a virus that we have gotten used to. this is coming from someone who has gotten the virus geez"
solo travel is better.
"but 2 can take grab / taxi..... but 10+ can take bus, and 100+ can take mrt"

"i know her, it's that tiktok girl 😄"
lol all the poor singaporeans being salty in the comments
novita looks like she’s talking to her crush.
people are dying just buying food.. why is this group travelling? what common sense is this?
"the travellers are quite brave to agree to be interviewed. to be honest, i expected more poorly conceived, needless negative comments that serve no purpose except to show the extreme bias and misdirected bitterness of the commenters."
they shld b tested on their return as to make sure they do not bring in covid-19 virus
oh yes they did. don't feel so green and don't feel so scared
"rs lin almost 2k new cases daily, many many people confirm scared !!"
lee chong  even scared we must be gracious isn't it?
rs lin die graciously?! 👻 mission impossible
"lee chong  impossible is nothing. graciousness is breed. head high, shoulder straight."
germany now has 4th wave: delta
are they volunteer suicidal? 🐷

"if got covid19 there, then bring it back to singapore, thank you cna. vaccination not 100% mah"
probably kena covid and thats it !
she look aged fast..
instagram is full of photoshop
filters are amazing
vincecarlo that’s why cna did not use filters
wow so much inspiration travel to germany !! i dont care  so much money!!!
and they say they are doing things to stop the spread of the virus.
who says we are closing ? this is 1st step to opening
aaa w
used to be communist propaganda prevalent. not now. the age of vaçcinated propaganda has arrived.
"and when these group of ppl return, they start to spread delta variant in singapore and gov will say it is normal!!!!!! really selfish to max!!"
no one cares.. what is she reading off notes or smth?
what's the point in covering this when we have gone back to the 2 pax restriction here? just to rub it in to those who cant travel? and novita lam proving how the typical dense singaporean girls are.
she went to germany to find more guys
<b>traveling during pandemic is just a dumbb move period cos your mind will never be at ease at any seconds cos world situation is crazzy so just stay put and enjoy our local tourism</b>
"i think it's super risky to be traveling in the pandemic because you never know when singapore will close the borders or implement the 14 days quarantine or other things that may happen. but if it makes a person happy then i think it's fine, just got to be safe"
"spot on. the risk is not catching the virus, but the restrictions your home countries will set on you if you catch it."
"i would just enjoy my extra time in germany and wfh from there. anyway, life there is probably more normal and less stressful than how it is in singapore."
they wont close borders for citizens lah
"this is surreal. fully vaccinated people go on a holiday trip and get interviewed, because of that. and then reporter is asking, “as the covid situation evolves (i cant hear that supermarket announcements anymore) what made you go on that trip” please people wake up, get you life back, stop being so anxious"
"cna waste their money for these six fools. whoever suggest this idea must be the biggest wanker. what does this coverage have impact for singapore or global? like pre-covid, germany is top 3 country that singaporeporean visited is it? obviously no lah🤦‍♀️"
why are you so triggered. we have to eventually return to normality. you really want to forever be in state of alarm?
ryan what talking you?
"funniest thing is, india pm visited us and no major global news channels cover it. haha even heard that 3rd tier us administration which welcomed modi. wow so much for big country of 1.2 billion ""superhouse""😂"
novita lam is too overrated anyway
vaccinated doesnt meanyoucannot get the virus.youcan still get covid19.. n they dont haf to quarantine after coming back???  dangerous!!!
scripted. how about the govt zooming in to this group as lab mice to test for the virus once they are back in sin? report the stats to us sporeans. wld be dying to know the outcome.
influence what exactly?? high educated must read script ah lol
this is hilarious 😂! suddenly a traveller becomes a authority in covid lol!
are you jealous? anything else to say?
rs lin  not at all.... just watching all this stupidity around me.
hari somakantan  a bit of awareness is always helpful  cannot live like a tortoise who doesn't know what is happening outside.
rs lin if propaganda is the way to create awareness good luck! are jealous of the tortoise 🐢 🤔?
hari somakantan  i don't call this propaganda. it is awareness.  anyway nobody is forcing you to travel and we don't know whether you can or not
rs lin  i rest my case! people who are fed propaganda cannot really tell the difference.  human life is more important than economic growth. they want people to travel from  singapore and infect others overseas. and you think that is a good idea right?
we need to start an ivermectin travel to jb giant club challenge..i rather trust that to prevent need for oxygen tanks..
privileged
if only all the unnecessary travel is halted.... many poor people will be getting their meals. also unnecessary travel contributes to global warming..... the next pandemic for which there is no vaccine.... 🙄
is it her fault to be rich? be gracious and give her a break
rs lin can her richness prevent the future disaster.... although her refraining from such trips can save the world
is tat the reason the open the birder gir germany
influencer so desperate to travel and get some pics for instagram
are you very jealous because of this ? isn't this her right to travel and appear on cna?
these influencers are such a waste of space on earth. they literally have no talent. just look pretty and get paid millions lol.
she's already rich in the first place lol.
gary tan jing da how the rich get richer: post photos with luxury bags and taitai lifestyle
let’s eat the rich
"the us said trips to singapore ...  have become more dangerous because of the coronavirus, raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hub.... from almost covid free to covid full. would india be next to advise against travel to singapore?"
they gave the same advisory on hk
rs lin not quite. us cdc raises covid-19 travel health notice for singapore to level 3. us cdc raises covid-19 travel health notice for hk to level 2. the cdc's highest travel health notice is level 4.
yesterday 2236 cases n 5 deaths  next target 3k then 5k
vincecarlo us cdc announced this morning that travel warning for hong kong was raised in error on monday. so hk remains at level 1. singapore raised to level 3. highest level is level 4. won't take long for socially responsible govs to ban flights from singapore. guess mtf's plan to open up just backfired.
rs lin  1 mth old fake account  stop spreading fake news
what does this lane mean? if someone is tested positive and is fully vaccinated... are they allowed to fly back?????
"if tested positive, quarantine for 21 days ."
"chris tan ah.. what i meant was if the test in germany showed positive, before the flight. in other words we are unfortunate enough to get covid whilst travelling, what happens then?"
"prior to boarding return flight, they have to take a pcr test. only if the result is negative, they will be allowed to board. back in singapore, they have to take one pcr at airport, then 2 more over the next few days."
"(bloomberg) — the us said trips to singapore and hong kong have become more dangerous because of the coronavirus, raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hubs by one level.  the us centers for disease control and prevention said anyone who hasn’t been vaccinated should avoid non-essential trips to singapore, citing a “high level” of covid-19. “all travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading covid variants,” the cdc said, increasing its travel advice for singapore by one notch to level 3."
while us still posts higher infection rates than singapore and hk. stop using the us as the gold standard please
"hey us, speak for yourself"
it's hilarious that the us posts advisories against any country when they have more covid cases than everyone else.
"in germany, singapore is still considered a safe destination though"
next target 3k then 5k daily cases for tiny 720km² island akan datang
vincecarlo what has area got to do with anything? what you need to look at is cases/population. also singapore does much more testing than any other country so of course the number of cases will be high.
"i would travel out of this country asap if given any opportunity as well. just by looking at this comment section filled with insufferable citizens with perpetual negativity, people that only know how to whine and complain at everything, is enough to make anyone gtfo of this shithole place"
giving scripts to social media influcuencers is considered news now? how far has cna fallen?
we are running out of conspiracy theory..from 2 weeks to flatten the curve to vaccine passport. fascism is making a comeback 👏👏👏

useless
know your audience cna please
cna audience ?? just targeted propaganda.
"all the salty comments. while i personally wouldn't be travelling now due to the inconvenience, i don't see why others shouldn't. in fact, there are many  who are travelling to europe and the us now for various reasons .  not sure what's the big deal to get everyone all riled up."
the ones at home are bearing the consequences of those travelling and bringing the disease back home. that's selfish.
"nicktasteless the ones at home are already producing 1600 cases a day. importing a few more hardly makes a difference. in fact, those imported cases are almost always detected through multiple pcr tests. local cases are not always detected and spread more."
nicktasteless thare are only 5 import case. say hi to the 1500 local community cases! 👋
utku tefek where was it before 1600+ ? less than 20. everyday import import import. now see what happened.
strawberryshortcake ^
"strawberryshortcake and you dare to say ""only"". you very well knew lives are at risk because of this. selfish."
you're right. i think it's a bit perplexing as to why this is news 😂
i guess they also brought portable oxygen tanks and portable icu monitors while travelling.
what they won't tellyouis how many came back positive
wads the fun in such ways & measures in travelling..
so many dislikes. is it because novita showed up or what?
can see a bunch of sour grapes lolll
you catch the virus your problem
heyyouforgot to add the “paid advertisement” tag
totally scripted so obvious she is reading fm a script
supporting lavish lifestyle traveling during a pandemic where people are losing job. well done cna.
we saw months and months of news report and articles about people losing their jobs. one report about people travelling and you lose your mind.
"if you look at it from another angle, they are actually providing jobs in the tourism industry. keep your perspective open :d"
terence being green is not productive
and give her a break. it's not her fault to be rich and able to travel
jy lee how many in tourism industry being helped and how many families now suffering under home recovery and covid cases?
"in the other news: singapore 82% vaccinated  clusters all over the island including pfizer ap hit record 2236 cases n 5 deaths.  back to wfh, hbl, 2 to dine in. sure looks like mrna jabs are working just fine 👍👏👏👏"
"these reporters is much better, she doesn't make everything sound depressing. the strait times people are just sadge."
"i've got friends posting their trips to maldives, uk and us now on insta, why are we acting like these trips to germany are all that special?"
used to be communist propaganda prevalent. not now. the age of vaçcinated propaganda...
"singapore can't get their local act together.... yet govt open up borders, but restrictions imposed on its citizens.. unbelievable!!!!"
how to be famous during covid: i travelled while other ppl cant. got featured on cna. cna you are all time low now.
novita is already femes what.
germany now has 4th wave; delta
what a waste of her time to be talking to cna while on holiday. her parents must love air purifiers.
awareness for us who are scared
&gt; 3x dislikes on video  160 media doing so well
she alr knew the interview questions prior. her answers aren't thought of on the spot. she keeps looking down at what i presume to be her notes.
this is the propaganda tool by our fav govt.
"even when they are  doing propaganda material, the actors actresses are still not up to par yet."
that is normal for organized interviews... if you have done or organize an interview before this is normal process. interviews question are often shared to prepare for interviewee  the interview. though something some reporter might digress to get a headline out of the interview :)
"u do know this is the norm right, they are not being questioned for wrongdoings, most of the celebrities' interviews are like that too."

crazy to travel at this time. no need to flaunt🙄🙄🙄.
crazy to travel at this time🙄.
"please give me a time frame you think is suitable to travel? when covid hit 0 cases worldwide? because that’s never going to happen. we are alr 80+% vaccinated and 90+% if we exclude 0-12 age range… if you’re not willing to open up, then just stay home and let people do what they please"
still talking
group of 6 can travel overseas but fully vaccinated groups of 5 can’t eat out together 😂😂😂
"muppets with their muppet logic. after "" the promised "" to open up; 82% vaccinated  back to 2 to dine in"
traveling and eating are two different things.
vincecarlo so many tables to choose so why worry dine in 2 or more.
boba fett so are you saying it’s more risky for vaccinated folks to be out eating than traveling?
thanks for hitting those sly foxes on the right spot m
darren rod depends if you eat outside during travelling. but mask off when eating definetly higher risk than walking around with mask on. also depends if where you're going high risk or not. need context for fair answer.
darren rod eating surely more risky cos mouth open all times eating and talking also air around is staganant while traveling lowest risk  cos people moving around and mask on all the time so hope you see the logic.
"boba fett tell me,  on a long haul flight from singapore to frankfurt, absolutely no food nor drinks are served to the passengers."
this country is for the rich
boba fett dun talk like primary sch student
vincecarlo who askyouto be so easily swayed by the hidden hands pressure ?
amos cookie youmean the 82% that took the wonderful super spreader mrna jab ?
https://youtu.be/mrus3dxkk9uhttps://youtu.be/mrus3dxkk9u - my fellow singaporeans
darren rod  exactly 💯 what we need to do the tyranny
"in the other news: singapore 82% vaccinated. clusters all over the island including pfizer ap. hit record 2236 cases n 5 deaths.  back to wfh, hbl, 2 to dine in. sure looks like mrna jabs on national program working just fine 👍👏👏👏"
😂😂😂
and we talk about net zero emissions 🙄🤔
no natural beauty women are always lucky
"if you were to read from a script, wouldn't reading from a monitor be much better? to make it look less obvious"
why this channel has more dislike 😂
seal young losers can't face the truth.
she looks cute
now so many people get cause of the fake testkit. people must be crazy to come to singapore
u clicked on this video because of novita lam
plsssss tell me singapore is not paying this over privileged fool's leisure teavelling with ordinary singaporeans folks tax payers money...!!!!!!!!!!!
enjoy yourself safety and healthy
"seriously why need a script? l0l our education fail, such interviews need to be scripted. or now singapore is closet communist?"
did they hire instagrammers to promote travelling now?
seal young i sure can. but how is that relevant to my question?
no theyre from wuhan tourism board
not to promote traveling. but to promote government propaganda. it's cheaper to pay instagrammer instead.
wilson  just ignore seal young (1 wk old) &  greatful so (1 mth old)  both accts are 1 n the same person.  fake account spewing 💩💩💩
hopefully live back to normal
so she is happy that a group of 6 can travel? trying to entice the unafraid and unvaxxed ppl to do the silly plunge?
feel free to die from covid then. stay poor.
invinciblemode  so you like to curse people. i bless you health and long life.
"t tw nah, stupidity will be its own reward. don’t need to curse anyone. life will take care of you."
so cna what made this as a news?? so do we need to congratulate them for being able to travel? the world has opened a long time ago! only singapore has not! lol
"didn't you read the salty comments, some thinks singaporeans should be hermits and stay home forever. this is news to them. lol."
basically they're trying to fool people as though the unvaccinated is barred from travelling to any countries. while the reality is they're travelling all over the place all the time.
exactly. they really thought all singaporean are fools who read only cna or st news.  vaçcinated non-vaccinated all can travel as long as they fulfill the arrival country covid regulations.
"why so salty lol, you dont have to watch every single video cna releases right?? to me, it was pretty insightful to learn how other countries and people are different countries are dealing with covid and"
forgive them  they are losers. probably our base
so salty
chandra hartono  why are you here all the time? nothing better to do? cna is spitting at you yet you watch have some backbone and boycott them. you are like a vip member here spewing nonsense

"for some (unvax) they might never left this island and it is very very unfortunate. for sharing, a family of 4 unvax pre travel post travel (at hotel quarantine) before all trip ticket hotel etc will be closed to 11k. there are countries accepting unvax visitors just pcr negative test and  quarantine more test. singapore is an island   not like us europe or even malaysia where you can travel up sub-urban or remote and still live proudly even without dine in. for once in my life after many years in singapore, i felt trap and encased on an island; torched my mind lately how to venture out. bearing in mind the world is so big...realised so much i have miss out now."
go get vax lah simi sai
maximillius kiasi get vac
"in the other news: singapore 82% vaccinated  clusters all over the island including pfizer ap hit record 2236 cases n 5 deaths.  back to wfh, hbl, 2 to dine in. sure looks like mrna jabs are working just fine 👍👏👏👏"
go until so chum… total waste of money and time
"she got money to waste.........lol lol lol..........she part of the ""crazy rich asian"" part of society!!!"
"what group of 6? not 600pax? thought many ppl sign up? good old days, 10-20k goes jb on weekend. what so great to be delighted with this at this serious juncture? forgotten just germany and brunei. even hk did not join in bubbles?"
"seal young this wave is x times more serious than 2020. a lot of ppl pretending to be life as normal. scared yes. just got ""foul mouth"" by guy in below reply-scared go vax. think time will tell who right who wrong."
"covid_vaccine has the structure of hiv same as covid 19 virus to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus(just like overclocking immunity system temporarily), but unable to deceive the new covid 19 variant, the virus will permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to duplicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated.  covid vaccine is a resistance of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like 'murphy', ""against the virus not eliminated"", currently the opportunity to the death of having vaccine injection is less due to it's ineffectiveness since vaccine maker has been modified it to be safe.  vaccine manufacturer can be sued now after fda fully approve those vaccine, this is great liberty status evolution. a lot of people death or having long term adverse reaction in vaccination before, and the government still keep hiding the truth..);▽▼"
stupid policymakers
nice
"insensitive reports from cna to glamorise this travel group at a time such as now when many singaporeans are suffering from lack, worry and grief."
"on the contrary, it provides relief & hope for some of us that travelling will be happening in the near future & that we are prepared to live with covid-19! what’s with all the negative comments here gosh."
eunice is it her fault to be able to travel?give her a break. i smell envy from miles away

"my one rich friend has many good class bungalows. he shared with me, gdp growth to him is more important than anyone else in the world because his investments and wealth is directly linked to gdp. he feels that gdp growth should be at all cost. its directly in his own self interest. he loves influx as it reduces cost to his businesses using cheaper labor"
she's reading from a script lmao
ya lol. gg
nothing surprising
lol
"i mean, can you come up with what to say or remember the script? i can’t"
speaking on tv not easy lah. many would write down so you won’t look stupid stuttering and forgetting. it’s a smart thing to do.
"obv she had to say on the lines of being concerned about the ongoing pandemic and insecurities of the travel lane..but in reality, ifyougo to europe, one will feel much more free. unmasked outdoors, feeling normal in the somewhat more rural areas. in the city, as long as observe cautious distancing, wear mask indoors and vaccinated, its fine"
"if you’re ever interviewed for the news, you’ll know that writing a script greatly helps you to answer the questions as detailed as you can without going off point, stuttering, or having long awkward pauses.  during my time as a journalism student, i had interviewees who didn’t prepare scripts and end up making 10 minute interviews into 30 minutes, giving the problems mentioned above and even needing me to reshoot parts where they screwed up answering.  so there’s nothing ridiculous about reading off-script, if you wrote it yourself with your honest answers."
"you all bodoh or what, obviously when talking about issues like these they will share with her the qns they will ask so that she will not blank out on live tv right. so if she prepared the qns, and just wrote down to prepare herself that's normal what. the only thing you can zham is her memory cui la"
"hypercarryhd germany has average of 7,700 daily cases this week. that’s not exactly “fine”. it’s always “fine” until it’s not. but if course, risk is on the traveller, you choose your own risks. if you get sick there and are stuck there, the expenses and troubles you face - are they worth it, that’s all."
xie lian hua cheng  http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23160#160 media. can't expect anything less soon to join n.korea n prc in bottom 5

"another thing to note if the occupants in your flat do not have the same travel history as you, you must self isolate in a room with an ensuite toilet otherwise you have stay in a hotel to wait for your arrival test result. if it fails, go back to quarantine protocol."
"usa's cdc online database - vaers. it shows 500,000+ people reported serious side effects after the vaxx, with 15,000+ deatttt*hs. with no liability for the government clerks, experts, media, hospitals, doctors, vax manufactures and scientists - we have what we have. vaers   hhs   gov"
"btw, which travel insurance did she buy which didn’t require a pcrt before her departure to germany? as far as i know, if you do not take the pcrt prior to leaving singapore, the insurance policy will be effective only on and after the 14th day of the travel! this means if you have covid before the 14th day, you will not be covered for covid related illness.  in addition, the risk of failing the pcrt before returning to singapore. you will have to stay in germany for at least (including quarantine period) 21 days before you are allowed to return to singapore, that is, if you pass the pcrt after 21 days in germany. so have to prepare for all these unexpected expenses which may not be 100% covered by the travel insurance. just hope that the singapore govt can look into this and relax the restrictions a bit. otherwise, it doesn’t help much of having a vtl scheme."

be ready to welcome more virus to singapore.. 👏
"if they can enter singapore why we cannot come out of thye hwa kwan home in angsana , pelangi village buangkok green after gotten influenza shot , 2 covids vaccines and a booster , is the vaccine proper or correct vaccines bought by singapore goverment , is singapore save ? after the vaccines dying  increases why"
waiting for sri lanka
here we prevent there are those coming and going to get infected.  aiya how long we going on life like this .  things are getting more expensive even hawker food rented out to foreigners at higher rental dun expect to sell reasonable price  also bad attitude by food stall noticed in hawker centre.  takeaway boxes are charging much more buy 5 pkts need to pay extra$1.50 or more for boxes.  wat should we do now can govt help us tku
why not norway??????????????? ffs
why nowyouwant to shre tje shot
beware to those countries i must say. look at germany's situation now. covid is out of control eversince they re-openes border with singapore.
remind me again who pay their salaries?
what have salaries got to do with this? poor whiner
the first ever vaccines in the world to grant immunity from logic.
"don't understand the xenophobia against indian subcontinent. everyone blames india for spreading delta variant as if we did it on purpose. people forget where did the actual pandemic begin.  point here being, that it could very well have been any other country that india or china. we are all victims here, singaporeans are not exclusively in this club.  grow up people, opening the borders is the only way out. plus the government is doing it in a step by step, calibrated manner. if something goes wrong, vtls will be halted. stop blaming one country or one nationality for your perils. last i check we are all in this together."
why can’t we see how many dislikes on this channel anymore? damn i missed seeing the dislikes 😭😭
the whiners had woken up
😂
"""able to enter singapore""? how about the other way around? will they allow singaporean to enter their country? dont you think singapore always get bullied by other countries, even by its neighbours."
"vtl for all, foreigners still have to apply vaccine travel pass, while singaporean exempted and they just buy tickets and travel use vtl.. nobody is getting bullied"
cant wait to see this global covid scam fall into shattered pieces
hello how about us....my hubby and i  would lije to visit singapore....we are fron the philippines fulky vaccinated already....can we enter http://singapore.next/singapore.next year february 2022? thank you very much😍😍😍
i hope so. and i think we will open to philippines too
"and still no philippines as the distribution of vaccines really slow,there’s only 34% of fully vaccinated while the rest still on process of getting their second jab can’t blame singapore govt if philippines still not on their vtl lanes but hoping they’ll consider us in near future .godbless singapore"
the irony is we have sufficient vaccines here but the yakjers are making a mockery out of them. in philippines they are treasured items to save lives these yakjers are a lost race
vaccination rates thailand 52.8% phil 35.4% indo 30.9% india 27% thailand n phils has higher vaccination rate but india n indo on vtls. total insanity
why not algeria 😥
"so from jakarta indonesia to singapore, 1. what airline does provide vtl flight? 2. does the person need to be inside  indonesia for more than 14 days minimum before flying our from indonesia to singapore?"
if you are concerned about progress then just stay in your bedroom and shuddup
well said. they are a frightened lot.
if singapore can open vtl lane to india when their cases are one of the worst in the world. i don't see why singapore don't open to all. there are some hiden agenda.... what crap are they hiding from us ?
"things slightly stabilise and the government brings in more problems. can’t understand this. besides, do we need these people? i sure as hell don’t think so."
can't shut down borders forever
life is for living and not hiding
my hair started falling when i see india is included. we don't have many rivers like theirs. big problem coming
"currently singapore is more threat to india than india to singapore. look at the percentage population, if you don't know maths then better change your tutor"
"industrial management  yeahhh.. no it doesn't work that way. you can't quantify ""threat"". even if only 0.1% of people on the internet are idiots, that's still a lot of idiots. same goes for the way you're thinking this. even if india has less % of people that got covid, doesn't mean they are ""less of a threat"" to singapore. 5million carriers are still 5million carriers. you can't just extrapolate that percentage and assume the same percentage chance on the flight's passengers to be carriers. you think you're good at math, but you're extremely bad at logic."
your hair is not our major concern
"for fw,youthink tourist  ?"
"rev india has reported between 10,000 to 20,000 cases per day. given the population of india, that’s far less than singapore’s infection rates. also, look at the size of singapore, and look at the size of india. singapore is a lot more dense than india is. chances of covid spreading here more rapidly is greater than in india’s at this moment. there’s a lot of herd immunity being built up there. finally, when singapore’s borders were closed, that was when most of its cases were spread. india was closed to singapore. most, if not all, cases in singapore have been internally spread.  i’d suggest that you connect the dots better."
aren't you intending to plead guilty in usa? please don't come back.
bmpcos he should go to india. one rape in every sixteen minutes. hahaha
amos yong so you live in a rape free society ?
"did i heard wrongly?  maybe new variant? so these travellers gonna each bring home a ""christmas present""?lockdown otw...."
"currently singapore is more threat to india than india to singapore. look at the percentage population, if you don't know maths then better change your tutor. look at india's number and singapore covid cases and then talk"
industrial management  watch cna lately? a reporter (wearing mask) doing news report in the street. and behind him many walk without wearing  mask in crowded street. how genuine is the infection rate reported?  imagine social discipline in the rural area. 🤭
india has more herd immunity than us.
yoda 🤭
yoda most agree 👍
"singaporean dont go other countries and spread virus there, stay put.. 😂"
sweetkiller xx other countries will accept singapore cause we don't produce fake certs to work or travel.. 🤣
alzarioyouguys still good in forge documents haha..
sweetkiller xx 🤣youmake whole world laughing at u. 🤣 🤣
"alzario still google, microsoft, ibm, pepsico and other leading company are handled by indian ceo. i must say indian fake certificate are better than your original"
industrial management  🤣 🤣 is that the only thingyoucan say? coming out from toxic air polluted country? another one making whole world laughing. 🤣 🤣
"industrial management yes,  but why no singaporean ?"
yes...looking forward to go batam again.
let’s goooo
"oops, singaporean should stay in their home country atleast until their gov managed to put covid under control."
singapore are like being locked in the cage allowing external to infect us but yet cannot leave.
really? we are an open society.  must open otherwise we will cease to exist .try to live like everyone else
why not y'all singaporean take over the ft jobs.. don't talk as your country no covid at all.. singapore still considered high risk yet other country agree with vtl.. if scared dig a hole and live there.
most cases are internally spread
"are we really under restrictions? look at mall and other places, seems like nobody gives a damn either"
please think about bangladesh 🇧🇩
it will be soon we will finally open to all countries.
"so illogical india and indonesia included but not thailand.  in addition, travelers from singapore to thailand enjoy quarantine-free travel."
precisely
india is for fw n indo is for maids.youthink for tourist ?
vincecarlo thailand is for the ahpek at massage spa
"shahrul andeka youalso ah pek ar, like to go phuket"
vaccination rates : thailand 52.8% indo 30.9% india 27% thailand has higher vaccination rate but india n indo on vtls. total insanity
did thailand want to have vtl too? probably thailand just want to close their border longer
malcolm ang  time to get ur head out of the sand. thailand has granted tourists from 63 countries now exempt from quarantine rules including singapore. sprouting nonsense
too bad
vincecarlo 🤣🤣🤣 that was before covid leh alamak
waiting for japan .
no need quarantine? delivery riders in singapore need to be monitored as the do swab at a test center weekly? foreigners no need? correct me if i wrong
covid19 is the best thing that has ever happened to us as it allows us to wfh. :)
wonderful!  the living has to go on living.  👏🏻👍🏻🎉🎊
please consider philippines also to have vtl please... number of cases there are low already.. been away from family for 4yrs already😞
it will be opened soon to philippines
bmpcos thank for noticing my comment sir
archangel channel  thanks too. would be great when philippines is included..take care
bmpcos godblessyousir
"the term vaccinated travel lane reminds me of disabled toilet. if it is disabled, it can't be used. a travel lane is a lane that is vaccinated? how?"
hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
open to all country la...  allow all person with 2 doses vaccinated easy  to understand!
open vtl lanes but causeway haven't open..... wth
"becos when we have domitory  covid  outbreak in 2020,  they shut us out, wahahaha"
causeway is used up to 300k commuters daily. vtls only 21k load since opening. dont be stupid.

"yah, would be really keen to know the singapore government's criteria on which countries to include in the vtl"
ate puy  💰💰💰💰
how y’all know the countries aren’t already discussing with singapore or it is the other country that is against the vtl…?
ate puy india cases are so bad and they open vtl to them. why not other country which are safer. they have some agenda that is hidden from us.
"waynenergy  for construction workers,youthink tourist  ? indo is for maids loh"
vaccination rates : thailand 52.8% phil 35.4% indo 30.9% india 27% thailand n phils has higher vaccination rate but india n indo on vtls. total insanity
"probably vtl with those countries are also because of corporate/business related, not just tourism. singapore and thailand not much businessmen traveling back and forth for corporate related reasons if not mistaken, mostly is for tourism related activities."
not every country want to do vtl lane. vtl lane have to come upon both party in the first place.
malaysia on 27? really?
ate puy they only have one criteria: any country that is vaccinated with pfizer is ok to coming in regardless of their situation.
haru krentz  helps to make more super spreaders
vincecarlo hah its true though. singapore are re-opening their border with countries far away from them. why? because most asean neighbours are using sinovac and az vaccines. 😂😂 but hey seeing what happen in germany right now i'm glad they did it.
haru krentz interesting.. look what is happening now in europe - another covid surge :(  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ofnrdrokwm&ab_channel=bbcnewshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ofnrdrokwm&ab_channel=bbcnews  european countries consider further lockdowns after another surge in covid cases - bbc news
haru krentz even if that country has very high daily cases :( <b>sigh</b>
because  they belittle us.  they think that we are poor.  knowing that singapore is a small country and can vaccinate the entire population in less than a month.
"vincecarlo indonesia currently have one of the lowest infection rate in the region, with some days positivity rate &lt;1%. few active cases remaining and icus mostly empty. in march 2021 serology survey showed 60% of people in jakarta already exposed to covid. with the july-august spike and vaccinations i think we may have achieved herd immunity (sadly at the cost of many lives lost). our gov’t need to be careful because studies show immunity only last about 90 days so there’s risk of new wave in december-january."
"brown nosing, obviously! usa and uk farts smell better, i guess!"
sri lanka open
alhamdulilah
ok. where's japan?
jp not ready for you so how about johore ok ?😁
india? where hundreds of thousands died earlier this year?
🤷🏻‍♂️
my suggestion is educate yourself first about current covid situation in all countries with a vtl status  otherwise you end up embarrassing yourself with your stupidity.
"and china not even vtl but category 1 can travel without quarantine and just test, haha bruh stop being salty, let this people use vtl and meet their loved ones..."
"yeah many died, you don’t worry jim pls take care lock ur door and rest in ur room. be safe !!!"
yes.
im a student and i havent been back home in india in 2 years. im glad they have opened everything up.
hopeyouhave a safe travel..happy to hear that
"happyyour leaving n going home,,,,please do take care  back in india n try to start afresh there, good luck"
happy for you man. have a safe travel and happy reunion with your family.
yes go back india dont come back please
"ignore this negative salty dogs comments,finally we are allowed to travel and meet our family members. safe travel brother, enjoy"
hondamugen2016 soh  very rude and uncivilised. shameful comment. brat
"hondamugen2016 soh i hope you dont have to face such time where you cant see your parents for more than 2 years because of a global pandemic coz if you did, you wouldnt survive. watch your words."
take care and be safe
hondamugen2016 soh sure bro ill take your mom along with me. need a snack for the flight anyways
"abhyudaya singhask yourself,  who to blame for unable to go back earlier ? the whole world is suffering,  but nobody trying to find out where  virus is coming from? very sad."
"so singapore doesn’t recognize and believe in natural immunity anymore, right? the moh and all health authorities should go back to medical school and be re-educated, perhaps.  isn’t it true that even the vaccinated can be infected, hospitalized and die from covid as well? how about an honest answer?"
vtl india? 🤦🏻‍♂️

"today record 18 deaths  "" stabilised "" yeah right"
vincecarlo they dont care about death. they only care money
hondamugen2016 soh  do you care about money?
this is really #$#%#%!$#%# especially india #%#%#$#%#%#
when we are not able to stop the spread in our own country people should refrain from pointing finger at other countries. the new numbers are speaking for themselves. every country had worked hard to contain the spread some managed  immediately and some after learning a hard lesson. lets support each other and let the economy grow again. our fellow citizen suffer due to no hospitality business almost closed. lets support the calculated and cautious approach by govt of singapore. if things become bad singapore govt will take necessary action.
constant jabbing and jabbing?
​joel anthony speaks volume of a person.
ako j its literally 2 jabs
why so selective . does this mean we also can travel to this vtlcountries if we are fully vaccinated.aany testing requirements?
vtl means quarantine-free if you are fully vaccinated
i think one have to bear their medical fees if they are positive when back to singapore...?
no if his status is vaccinated
great going singapore 👍🏻
👍👍👍
i'm just waiting for japan. i miss my second home

a  why shut up and lah? do you have anything constructive to offer?
me too
2 visitors in one household we also miss our gatherings with our families
cybertokyo no me too ok cos now cases spiking in south korea and germany so need to stop vtl cos hospital capacity overwhelmed.
when the f... k ryougovt going to let those unvac eat n go into shopping mall. sinceyouletting india n indonesia coming in.
dr. d. fisher: because there is no difference anymore now. people have to live with it.
hmmm even when fully vaccinated there's still a chace to catch covid/carrier but opening up really??? government really afraid they're pockets dry up while still playing with lives. other countries are also high in covid count. it's really a culling project by the government.
moh better make boosters mandatory before this happens
good idea
"the daily moh report should include all vtl travellers count and all covid-19 cases, mild or critical for cases related to them. asap.  otherwise in a few week time. mmtf will report the suprise and tell us all the new stablization is not 3000 in hospital but 10000.  serious !! citizen can only dine in 2 - now you allow 21,000 m-workers to roam around freely every week."
stupid law rite... we singaporean from 2020 http://till.now/till.now still at 2 and 5 . others can come in suka suka without quarantine later case high we singaporean affected by the rules again.
"lol you singaporeans should look at what is happening in germany right now. their cases are soaring at even worse level than a year ago, coincidence it happened after they re-opened their border with singapore? 😂😂😂😂"
send all migrant workers back to their country and see what is going to happen in singapore.  they are humans too. they are not slaves to lock and make them work.

amen🙏
i know of someone who's been waiting for the end of the world ie jesus comeback for a few decades. lots of mentally weak people out there.
seriously... india.  with the high potential of fake certificate and their infection numbers and death has always been fictitious. india lied and hid the fact they had the delta virus.  this will destroy singapore's health system.
doomed
lost jobs. many companies closed. no bonuses. must pay car insurance.  pay installment etc...where got money to travel tankuku.
then maybe sell the car?
those things you mentioned are exactly the reason why we should be reopening. it will create jobs.

how about batam ?
they mention indonesia...so is meaning the whole indonesia which of course includes batam
"we suggest singapore reopen to the whole world, no need to open slowly bit by bit!! hey here is the most safety country in the world. welcome, welcome 👍😂"
that will be the best!! cant wait to get out of this trap and live like normal again.
watch the number of covid infected shoot up. then close again lor. 😔
aiya actually wanted to open all to the world but the trouble all scared to come here beside that so many restrictions. wayang wayang la 👏👏👏🤣🤣🥱
we are in the right direction. step by step opening is a responsible way of opening to as to safeguard our health resources. nevertheless it will be an opening up decision by the govt. be patient

why tf are we opening up the borders while the restrictions on locals are as strict as ever? make up ur goddamn mind...
clap clap
👍👍👍
"really unhappy to receive this news. why allow foreigners into the nation without quarrantine? and worse yet, to allow certain migrant workers to leave for their homelands with ease, especially those whom have irrepairably tarnished the lives of singaporeans forever. there seems to be no consequences. what about the citizens whom have had their kindness taken as a weakness? also, the goverment could do better to protect the livelihoods of its citizens by reducing foreign competition. it is most disheartening."
"seriously , what kind of ppl ur?"

beez thenyoumust be low
no empathy at all in this post. which foreign worker has tarnished singapore's image? maybe buck up and do your best rather than faulting other people.
somesh salunke well said
"amutha, are migrant workers not human beings? shame on you for having such thoughts"
somesh salunke  well said. treat your fellow human beings with dignity and care
"bmpcos dignity? i've watched a documentary,  they have high and lower caste in india. a guy which they define him from lower caste has good qualification was discriminated and given degrading job. do we have it? here, singapore community's are being treated equally. thats dignity. you should learn more. . seem you are lack of knowledge in humanity. 🤣"

"amazing post mate, bito hit 1b in trading volume on day 1, was the second largest etf launch ever and was nearly the most traded etf overall yesterday. if the sec was concerned about demand from institutions for a bitcoin based etf, they can set those aside and go ahead and approve a real etf. we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. this is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don't back up their crypto assets. more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. i have made over 23 btc from day trade with william derrick insights and signals in less than 4 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish..."

"if i were the government i wouldn't know where to hide my face. various countries keep on rejecting their vtl, chucking them to one side, telling them to stop treating this pandemic like a walk in the park they still continue to do it. their skin so thick until cannot thick anymore already, i think the government wants to prove to the world how crazy and gung ho they can be by treating this virus like their long lost and beloved brother and killing off innocent singaporeans while they're at it."

jealous?
gaurav bad omen. nowyouknow.  🤣
alzario   for the  last few months there were no flights from india and still the cases in singapore kept rising. you people just need an excuse for the incompetency if you were really worried then you should have stopped flights from 🇨🇳 first. oh wait that you are not allowed to do 🤣🤣🤣 now you know
alzario  xenophobe in disingaporerace
bmpcos another bad omen.  😁
alzario  don't be so superstitious. opening up means we start to live again too much lockdown would waste our lives

"i love singapore, but i do not take medicines and injections, and i stay home, but i know the maks do not do anything, but i will wear one to keep from getting fined my groceries were delivered to my home before the so call pandemic.i moved to queretaro, mexico on 11-2-2021, where it is safe, beautiful, and clean, like singapore."
"extreme idiot strategy. when we were cleaned, overseas dirty, we closed borders to avoid virus flowing in. now we too are dirty, so no difference to open borders to let virus flow in. it will only make the situation from already worse to unbearable."
ccp and its core supporters should be tried for crimes against humanity....
just open border between singapore and malaysia please
"for opening of gurantine free land vtl with malaysia, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
he is very arrogant in his comments. but he is far from the old guards
not fit to be health minister
challenge virus to prove you are the elite   too bad cases getting more and more .what next … step down
"98.7% of infected get mild to no symptoms and you destroy the economy to protect the 1.3%? protecting the seniors that did not take the vax? why did they not take it in the first place? if you want to be pro-choice, don't differentiate between vax status. if not, you're just spitting in the face of those who chose not to take it. if you really want 100% vax rate for those eligible, why not mandate it?  why bother saying ""we can't mandate it"" but place all sorts of restrictions on those who refuse it? who are you trying to kid?"
"idk why you guys are criticising them so much. if you are so pro, then go and compete in the parliament lah. you are saying that they are talking nonsense when you are the ones who talks nonsense. you don't even have the balls to compete for parliament so just shut up."
getting elected does not meant one can abuse their authority to descriminate and coerce people into experimental vaccine. yes. nothing can be done to them but this will reflect on their next election ...
"honestly majority we singapore a vaccine we follow the rules the next bosster but never end  how to stop this covid 19 . singapore have to adapt this covid ,singapore will dining 5 people but not stays same household. what the points take bosster. if every days go up ,we got another special bosster again. ?"
its about making$$$$
still haven't stop about this matter...
the real 🤡
"are the participants of the bloomberg forum a different species of humans? why they can dine in 5s whereas locals are restricted to two. if all travellers are checked before coming to singapore, why are there still imported cases ? are there unvaccinated travellers with forged vaccination documents? i’m sure there are countries where fake documents can be obtained under the table resulting in imported cases."
social distancing everywhere. dining in for only 2. everywhere distance of 1.5 meters between people and tables. and then the big surprise. on the singapore airlines planes there are sitting 9 passengers in one row. no 1.5 meters distance. more then 2 people sitting together and eating their meals. joke right!

"why health ministry still described the surge in covid cases + death rates as ""unusually high""? the sorethumb group walking freely around in singapore are the unquarantined tourists, as: non-fully vaccinated cannot enter malls nor dine-out- locals discouraged by govt to socialise outside- locals can't visit loved ones in nursing home - foreign construction workers restricted from leaving their domitories"
stupid to spent billions on vaccine that don’t immunize people from the so call pandemic virus but little on therapeutic treatments even denialling drugs that are cheap like ivermectin that is effective.. indeed refusing to accept positive study cases like merck on the effectiveness. demonizing people even doctors who found iverm3ctin effective.
"because the government issued over us$ 200billions of bonds (ie debt) ytd 2021. thats more than 50% of gdp, issued in 10 months. government running out of money. but this will backfire as domestic consumption will weaken, other countries have no-travel advisories to singapore and domestic activity will slow. sheer stupidity."
singapore need vaccines from india get more doctor and scientists and political from india..👍🏼
singapore government so full of cowards!!!
madness and desperation
is he one of de candidate to be next pm?????? gone case!!!! wish our lky still around! now we really miss him.
i noticed most of the ah gong elite tasked to covid are either wearing specs and/or have very small eyes. no wonder they cannot see what they doing properly.
what everyone wants to know is whether the government has been fiddling with the daily number of new covid-19 cases. just how on earth did the number of new cases jump from 3277 cases on 26/10/21 to 5324  cases on 27/10/21 & then suddenly dropped back to 3432 cases on 28/10/21. please explain moh.
what will happen to the daily cases when we open up travelling again?
"as a task force for covid 19, their solution is to live with the virus. may i know what is the task force been set up by the government in the first place? what is their objective toward this mission? what the heck are they talking about? 5000 plus infection as on 28/10/2021. is this their goal? someone said they had applied a good strategy on the convid 19. wow, so the 5000 plus infection and the increase number  of death  is the good strategy that it mean? what the heck are they talking about. is this pap government? in the next election are they going to tell singapore that they had done a good job with the control of the covid 19 virus? are they going to say that without them singapore will not have a good strategy on how to deal with the virus.  what the task force minister need most is a mirror and, we singaporean need is a miracle. really lol. no this time round is cry out loud without tear."
an intelligent leader will know when to shut up 🤫  the more you speak the deeper you digging your own grave.  now imported cases increased from 8 to 12…will we see that 49 double digit imports in the future.  plus with over 4k community cases n over 500 dorm cases. congrats 👏 to min wong. your wish came true wanting to hit that 5k number game.  80% vaccination rate 75% infection rate.  now trying to inject our kids with a 3 month old vaccine with no clear data on the aftermath of the vaccine. while their immune system n organs especially the brain is still developing.  they are taking lightly the lives of our next generation for their own self interest. thistaskforce is all about the number games n their investment in biontech.

do you really want to end up with other immune disorders diseases after endless boosters? disease is not only this virus (99% survival rate) but so many other diseases that your immune system to heal..
this minister is getting more and more irritating with his nonsense
"hello mi key. with all do respect - cleaning up a nation is a lot harder work than cleaning up your fish tanks (u can all check out his uploads). you can see where your fish swim to and clean up their visible ""sai"". try that with 5.6mil people & and an invisible, morphing virus."

"singapore perfect 100 on covid recovery index singapore drops to pathetic 100 ranking on covid recovery index. gold standard achieved by multiple time failures overly reliant on rubbish mrna jabs ""singapore, on the other hand, slipped 30 places to 100th due to its persistent outbreak."" source - nikkei asia 5 nov '21"

how about lockdown? thankyou. can't have so many cases floating around in the community daily. old parents and elderlys are at the most risk.
the bad news is someone just imported in the new strain.
how can it be safer to open up to other countries with lower infectious  when they still have infectious rate. i can understand we need to open up but this point he made is puzzeling.
look at all the boomers in the comments go off at each other... so fun to watch...

i'm new to btc and i've been making losses trying to make profit myself in trading... i thought trading demo account is just like trading the real market... can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do ?
well... i will advice you should stop trading on your own if you keep losing and start trading with an exp because trading with an expert is the best strategy for newbies and busy investors who have little or no time to monitor trade.
"venturing into trading world without the help of a professional trader and expecting profit is like turning water into wine lol...you would need a miracle, that’s why started my trade with  the help of exp  dr yeong cheol"
that’s true most people today have been having a lot of failures in bitcoin trading and investment sector because of bad orientation and bad exp😔
"i lost £8,300 carelessly trading on my own, then i was referred to dr yeong cheol ,he help me  recovered the loss and i  made an extra profit"
"it's great to see others who also benefits from the service of dr yeong cheol, i’m currently on my 5th trade with him and it's a nice experience."
wow i'm shock you all mentioned and recommended expt dr yeong cheol i thought i'm the only one working with him 🤭🤭😂
"you don't need to be shock because i'm also a huge beneficiary of expert dr yeong cheol ,  who introduced me to a standard website broker that uses bot trading.✅"
"yes you are accurate , because since i started trading with dr yeong cheol i have not lost any trade ,with the help of the modern trading method bot trading, it's the best and most reliable trading techniques  ✅🥰🥰💯"
"i'm so happy for taking the bold step in working and investing $19,680 with exprt dr yeong cheol after a week i received $73,320 worth btc directly to my wallet.!"
"though i was strictly warned not to go to the comment section but here i am. and now i am sharing my testimony how profitably it is trading with exp dr yeong cheol, thank you very much sir 🙌"
i stumbled upon one of his clients testimonies and decided to try him out and now...i'm expecting my third cashout soon
here in marlton expert dr yeong cheol carries out the both orientation and mentorship potentials...
"how does this bitcoin trading of a thing works ,i’m interested in it and i’m willing and ready to invest heavily in it ,but i’m gonna need an assistant from any trusted and productive professional.."
"you don’t really need someone to tell you how it works, you can make research on your own and also try doing it yourself."
"dr yeong cheol is indeed a bitcoin trading and investment gods. with my first deposit of £1,300 i also got a payout of £9,011 in a week❤️ isn't that amazing!"
i remember friends calling me crazy when i started but i now shut up them with my four figure weekly returned😊
"it's not about watching videos and wasting your time on strategies, i was ignorant doing so.. so i decided to try dr yeong cheol and ever since then he has made about $45,000 for every $5,000 i trade with him"
is there trading service in singapore?
"there is really no country restriction in there company,,,i’m trading with them from germany"
what surprises me about their trading mostly is that they give client's access to her trading site whereby they can monitor their trades on daily basis. that's really awesome 😍😍
hello am from uk. how can i get to reach dr yeong cheol. my husband just approved my trading..
"i'm barbara from usa california , i have been hearing the good work of dr yeong cheol , on how he has been helping with perfect and successful trading . please how can i contact him so i can start my  trading investment today ."
is he available on whatsapp

why? cause money. but high risk country now. no one come.
"you are purposely scaring people with numbers!!! that's pure evil, saying you have 50 deaths per million is a false statement, in people's minds they will think 50 people die per month per million living in singapore, that is not true, let's have the numbers of people dying from heart attacks or diabetes in the same context, you will end up in 300 per million then, way scarier number then covid, but i don't see you restrict people from eating sugar and fat to get those numbers down, there are less then 300 people who died in grand total in singapore, that is the truth, now stop lying and stop overexagerating and stop scaring people !!!!!!!!! you are evil !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

he speaks yet can’t make any sense.
"i don't get the negative comments in these section. it is mandatory for the travelers to test negative before they arrive to singapore. even if there are some breakthrough cases, what is the big issue?. there are already thousands of cases in singapore. if you believe in vaccination, then the only thing you should worry is when the govt grants permission to allow unvaccinated people inside the country.   everyone in the world is going to get covid at some point of time. keep that in mind. just because you restrict, it is not going to stop the infection. it may delay it, but not stop it."
let's go brandon
keep hiding the vaccination status of the recent dead from the reporting to the public? why the lack of transparency when people’s lives are on the line? ... so disingenuous!!
"thank you 61% , thank you so very much. blood is on your hands for voting these bunch of clowns talking nonsense and flip flop everyday. and most of all, no accountability."

benjamin koh good luck dealing with the death penalty later.
their policies are rubbish! if by what you say protect the unvaccinated is your priority then why allow those medically exempted to go into malls? my goodness! aren't they the most vulnerable?
i am surprised that he is so naive to say that vtl is for business but not for leisure. a common-sense people will know that all people will rush for vtl for all sorts of purpose. he should know this issue will happen before implementing the policy. i am worried having him leading singapore to fight covid…..
your tax payer$$  gone into wrong hands hands that are quick to shed blood
with such a high vaccination rate plus booster rate its illogical to still have restrictions. they made it look like they aren't sure of what they are doing
great pretenders!! hardened and darkened heart
tell us the plans  what’s the plan to jab and jab and jab? any issues = underlying problems?  booster isn’t enforce now but what will the situation be in 2022? is the unvax first to be deal with? then the booster jab? then the no2 booster jabs ? this is a new vaccines. it can’t be the forever method when protection will wane what is the dormitories situation  how many get it and now get it again? no stats? alpha n now delta? what’s happening to yr so called natural immunity ? does the government even know what they are doing? how do i trust a govt when they were the one that said healthy no mask? herd immunity?  why sinovac is 3 jabs to be fully vaccinated  what is the stats in china? why do you make us jab without allowing us to check if we are protected after x jabs? just because the system cannot be done doesn’t mean it’s a one rules for all? we are high density country don’t talk abt 100cases a day covid is mutating  人算不如天算
"they use all force and regulations to control the spread of covid, but the covid case keep infect people every day, soon all the people in the world will get infected anyway, so why are they keeping use all forces and regulations  to stop human freedom. if you start to count the infected people from the beginning until now, and it look like  almost all people in the world already got infected."
they need money. that's why.
they are already buried with the highest pay in the world to manage such a tiny red dot!! that's obviously corruption !!
any money cannot bring into the grave 😡

"orange county firefighters service are suing orange county government. an attorney for the group filed a motion on oct. 1 asking for an emergency injunction to block the county from requiring employees to submit to unwanted vaccinations. employees say they were at first told that they’d be fired if they didn’t take the vaccines. later, the county changed the plan to issuing written reprimands, employees said. the department would not have been able to provide services properly if there was a sudden loss of 500 employees, about 38 percent of the department. looks like all those empty threat backfire once people all stand up together !"
their problem.
"because singapore govt can only control its own ppl , not those foreigners who are coming to spend $$$. and since riches in singapore don't pay taxes , you need to open up for small ppl  to go back to work , pay taxes/cpfs so govt has money to spend. or how to pay 2 million usd to each of those officials ?"

"dear friends.. i have gone throw some of your comments. already minister is explained why reopening borders with more countries. i am going to add a bit. every country has to survive with live and livelihood together. it can’t leave livelihood for a long times. the country will be getting permanent disable for long years of shut down the borders. that’s why need to open more countries for well being and survive singapore. not just shut down the border for more years where the truth is that we have to live with covid. this truth is not for singapore only, it is universal now. we have to learn from other countries also how they reconnecting and opening border with other countries. and pls note that only vaccinated people are allowed to enter in singapore. as i believe that there is nothing different for the antibody of vaccinated severity between singaporean and other country people, is same. so why we are getting shock when border opening for vaccinated only. if we look to europe, we can understand why mtf has decide to reopen. is there any of my friend can help to share the timeline that when will be the perfect and suitable time to reopen singapore borders to save life and livelihood. we have to reopen in a day. isn’t it? of course to save life is first priority than livelihood. also note please there are most of the cases are mild or no symptoms even covid positive because of highly vaccinated. and some of people need oxygen supplementation and icu because of severe disease and seniors who hasn’t been vaccinated or partially vaccinated. few are fully vaccinated.  let me share how some of other countries infectious rate is lower than singapore even singapore is highly vaccinated. because other countries was faced big wave of covid and most of them has been recovered, vaccination is on going. by this way infectious rate is lower than singapore.  we have to respect and accept the announcement of mtf as they are wised and qualified than us to think and handle the country.  sorry if someone understand me wrong or i have told anything wrong  thanks  mamun  bangladeshi  currently in singapore"
dear mamun so now can you explain the logic why restaurant cannot play music but gymn can play music ?  so what has music got to do with covid infection ?
boba fett hi..may i get a link or source that where stated or announced by mtf that music can’t play at restaurant and allowable to play in gym related with covid infection. so far i haven’t seen this kind of news at straight times also. thanks
md mamun miah go search st news reported it online 3 days ago you can read restaurant owners feedback.
thank you ministers for trying all your best for singaporeans. the whole world is badly affected too. we are a small country with less resources but we have come thus far. really appreciate all the measures taken here. thank you sir.
the singapore government has finally yielded to allowing sinovac to be accepted as a legitimate vaccine as it acknowledges that there are people who are wary about  messenger rma vaccine long term side effect. i applaud to singapore government's honesty to deal with this issue based on scientific knowledge and not political considerations.
they should also allow ivermectin. india controlled their delta peak using ivermectin.
isnt it too late for everything or too soon for something ?
there is a report of 90 sinovac side effects what say you. honesty?  hahaha.
"i realized that the secret to making a million is saving for a better investment. i always tell myself you don't need that new maserati or that vacation just yet. that mindset helped me make more money investing. for example last year i invested 80k in stocks (with the help of my financial advisor of course) and made about 246k, but guess what? i put it all back and traded with him again and now i'm rounding up close to millions."
"the pandemic came and taught everyone the importance of having multiple stream of income, unfortunately having a nice paying job doesn't mean you are financially secure anymore. so we all need to put in an extra - income earning chance, like investments."
"peter mish i agree with you, covid-19 taught us the importance of having a plan ""b"" income you are not safe with just one paying job, when nobody knows what happened to so many of us when the pandemic started. omg, it wasn't good at all i believe we all can relate to this?"
francisca sanz investment is that tiny line that separate the rich from the poor. the foolish from wise sorry to say. i can proudly say i am wise today because i can provide for my family through my investments.
"ever since i stopped my former job, i have been surviving through my investment, am so glad i invested i have been able to raise money from my investment and trading to start up my own firm."
"peter mish what is your advice for a new beginner like myself, i have been trying to practice using a demo account,but i am scared that i don't know enough to start trading all by myself. what to do next."
"ayaan jayaraman be careful not to jump into trading without any proper training because it can be very detrimental. many folk jump into trading only to suffer great loss at the very beginning. don't try to imitate a professional traders, better still ask questions. get the services of a professional stock expert or a licensed broker."
peter mish my  questions are;what  do i do next? plus is there any good recommendations i can lookup online? i am new here and worried that i might loose money.
ayaan jayaraman i trade with mr george d. wales. i was introduced to him by my very good friend. i got his info and we began our awesome partnership
"with the consistent weekly profits i'm getting from my investments with george d. wales i have no doubt i am financially secured, he is the most reliable person i know in the market now."
peter mish i think i’m grabbing this opportunity but how can i reach him? i need to be sure that i am safe

how can you compare a bicycle to the lives of humans??? judging by the comments seems like no regards for human lives
i am not visiting singapore zoo until all the animals get vaccinated
you tube is hiding a lot of comments. you won’t see them unless you click on the sign under the word “subscribe” .
"your arrogant and high-handed vaccination strategy is robbing people here the opportunity for natural immunity, which is the real immunity and not some toxic substances that need to be boosted every few months."
why money
it does not make sense. the whole point for reduced social gathering groups and dining in is to reduce human traffic? so what reasons can they use to justify bringing more people into the streets of singapore? can't have it one way and contradict it almost immediately
"even if they are so desperate to open border, stick to the current  14 days quarantine at facilities.  we dont need these ppl spread the virus at community area. travellers are now desperate to get out of their country too especially for work permit between malaysia and singapore. they can conveniently make an entry. for those travellers from europe and rest of asian countries if  they can come here, meaning they have the means to pay for it apart from paying insurance. rather than put restriction on the citizen and let loose these ppl."
$$$ very easy logic .  isn't singapore policy mostly base on it ?
"did you listen to the whole video? foreigners are tested rigourously before they come into singapore, it is now the local community that has more infections. livelihoods are at stake now. singapore need some tourists to boost the economy."
"alzario foreigners are tested rigourously before they come into singapore, it is now the local community that has more infections. livelihoods are at stake now. singapore need some tourists to boost the economy."
"​vanessa loh i would think having more bodies in our infectious local community means a higher rate of infection. vaccinated or not, they can still be carriers. it just seems kinda counter intuitive to have the community be placed under restriction but have tourist coming in. pick a direction and go with it. the whole talk about endemic just seems to have gone nowhere.  the video doesn't even answer the question on why there are inconsistencies between these policies. it just admits that there are inconsistencies and ask us to live with it. maybe if proper planning was in place when this whole thing started, then the economy would be in a better place."
"if you are so good, we would not have seen a big spike in cases and burden our healthcare right now. hello! we are ranked among tops in most infected nation right now. stop pretending that we did well compared to other countries. no one look behind. just open your small eyes and see the present state now!"

"would it come a day where they require everyone to take a booster shot every six months to be considered vaccinated? will they force us? why personal health is taken by the authority??  it is scary to be living in a world where you do not have control of your health. if you don't take booster, you are considered not vaccinated? are we going in that direction? what about the long term side effects of frequent booster shots? who is going to be responsible for the long term effects? how come nobody questions?"

all these naggers and complainers are foot soldiers? listen to them and the whole country will perish in no time.this is why we need wise leaders such as the current mtf ministers.the decisions may not be popular to some but they are made in the interest of the country

"fully vaccinated foreigners are allow to come into singapore. fully vaccinated can still be transmitted and be infectious to others. variate now are all asymptomatic. tested negative now while entering doesn’t mean they are not infected. while locally, dining, restriction here and there. sound contradicting.. myself and my family were infected, the service from moh is so disappointing. have we failed in fighting this pandemic? look at our figures. initially we were very concern about the figures. now we have a different approach about the figure. it’s endemic now. we know whats endemic."
"i hope you and family have recovered billy? im so pissed at what the gov is doing now. they have caused both my parents to be infected, both are in hospital now. i am frustrated and sad at the same time. n gov still opening up to foreigners aggresively!"
"shadostorm thanks man, we are fine now. but my two weeks without my family was a torment because they were also infected, and i felt so helpless in the facility. my wife and six yo suppose to be transported to join me, but they kept ignoring and over a week delay. until they have the cheek to tell my wife eventually that it’s only left a few more days for your qo, you still wanna join your husband? what kind of nonsense was this?? i called up moh umpteen times, kept saying they have escalated the matter, but over a week, nobody get back to u. called the mp, no use, so sick, stressed and helpless at that moment. really frustrated. especially whenyoucan’t do anything for your most beloved when they are also unwell. have to depend on my siblings to deliver food. imagine in my facility, the food was horrible, running fever and sore throat, they provide fried drumlets and chicken. almost every meal have fried food."

"they are paid millions and yet they try to give us their ""sermon on the mount"" or ""bicycle going down the mount""  while seniors are dying or dead from their half-baked plans.... after so many months and after so many people have to cough up  their own money to get vaccinated with sinovac (going rate was $125),  they have suddenly become ""charitable"" and decide to include it in their  singapore's national covid-19 vaccination programme  and after australia approved china's sinovac shot ahead of border opening.  if they have included sinovac in their national vaccination programme,  perhaps more seniors would  have been vaccinated and would not have been infected or died from covid-19. references: australian government department of health - therapeutic goods administration (tga) ""tga's recommendations on recognition of vaccines not registered in australia coronavac (sinovac) showed an average ve against symptomatic infection of 64% and an average ve against hospitalisation of 90%.  ve against symptomatic infection (surrogate for transmission) of 54%, 54%, 64%, 66% and 84% in five studies. ve against severe infection/hospitalisation of 100%, 100%, 88% and 73% in four trials. the standard schedule of coronavac is 2 doses administered 14-28 days apart.  based on regulatory, published and pre-print data this suggests the efficacy of coronavac is comparable to the australian-approved vaccines, although marginally lower in protection against symptomatic infection.""  tga thus considers that the coronavac (sinovac) vaccine is a ""recognised vaccine""  (!!!!!)."

"folks, use common sense. doesn't need a rocket scientist to understand this.  in israel the vaccination rate is 81% with 3rd booster shot and yet their daily cases are 10,000+. in singapore the vaccination rate is 80% and yet the daily cases is 1,000+. compared to 1 year+ ago when the population is not yet vaccinated the daily cases were only in the double digit.  so does this make any sense to you??? having more vaccination becomes more daily cases???  shouldn't the numbers be going down instead since the vaccine is super-duper-gooood??? and this virus has a 99.98% survival rate!!!!!! after more than 1 year+, the public are already more than used to wearing mask + social distancing +  keeping the numbers small in group and + vaccination. why are all these measures useless in keeping the numbers down?? the numbers are climbing up with all these measures in place as we speak!!! very simply, either these measures are not working or the leaders are simply corrupt  to the core and lying toyouabout the fake numbers.  either way, this so called ""pandemic"" is just a big lie to get the people to conform. once they succeed this time,  they will create ""crisis"" again as and when they need to control the people.  ask yourself questions, don't simply sit back and take everything the leaders are shoving  down your throat cause all these doesn't make any sense!!! and all the mainstream stream media(msm) in your country are not reporting the truth toyou about the vaccine.  they only show 1-sided data. use http://www.duckduckgo.com/www.duckduckgo.com to find real data and truth. google, twitter,  facebook and big tech are fake news and censoring anything that reports the truth. it's all about money, power, fear and control.  governments and leaders all over the world(led by the usa illigemate democrats regime) are now so evil and corrupt  that they are willing to lie toyouso that they can stay more into power. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wslw8l7uvuihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wslw8l7uvui"

majority of foreign workforce in singapore are from your neighbouring asean countries esp malaysia and philippines yet you are not opening borders from them considering singapore has higher cases per day. but you are open with countries such as uk which is now living with covid. what’s the difference of a vaccinated brit with a vaccinated person in asean? the problem with the government is lack of empathy and logic. http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23clowns#clowns

"there’s one thing that i still do not understand. for a long time before sep our case nos. were very low in double digits. then the govt announced “living with covid” and suddenly our cases spiked to 4 digits. but if you look at the imported cases they still remain very low, in double digits even till today. so my question is where did all these new local cases originate from?? did our testing fail to detect infected persons coming in at the border? or did we detect them but still let them loose onto the population assuming that since we are 85% vaxxed that nothing bad will happen? or more sinisterly, did moh deliberately massage the numbers of imported cases into local cases with justification that they are prs returning from overseas? bear in mind that throughout this time our social restrictions have never eased, in fact they were tightened significantly. this is a big logic gap that the govt’s narrative so far has failed to address."
the cases spiked when they gave vaccinated ppl false confidence. it started since ndp 21st august where discrimination towards unvaxxed started. vaccinated ppl have quietly been super silent spreaders. im pissed at their mistakes everytime. it has caused both my parents to be at hospital now.
"it is my twenty years experience, so take this thing seriously. the doctors will never recommend you this thing because they don't know this thing. it is not the knowledge from books but a knowledge from the long experience of practical.[why mostly rich people have been dying with covid 19 why death ratio is lesser in poor country(and in poor countries, it is the rich people who have been dying not the poors )] make your diet very very strict for some days if you get affected with covid 19 and you needn't to be frightened of any type covid 19 virus or it's variants. read this phrase throughly it is my twenty years experience of the hell of pneumonia (when the doctors become helpless and the all medicines are worthless. what would you do then. the medicines are not capable to treat the primordial  pneumonia. how they can treat this dreadful covid 19 caused pneumonia , there is only one thing, it is your body who has to fight with covid 19 or covid 21, so be prepared for that. and i make you sure on it that a human body has the capability to kill this virus, no matter how  many forms does it change itself. let's get ready to do so. ) i have lived the hell of pneumonia and inflammation so far. and the doctors prescribed me only things those were, antibiotic. they prescribed me more strong antibiotics when the first one stopped working . when all the antibiotics stopped working i had no way but controlling my eating habits to control the severe inflammation and excessive mucus problems . because ayurveda described this thing. it is a natural thing to treat pneumonia and inflammation with no side effects.  all the friuts, dry fruits, most of the grains [except wheat, gram or cheakpea ] , all the lentils (except pigeon food or masoor dal) [ pigeon food means masoor dal not tuwar dal so don't be confused and avoid tuwar dal because it is inflammatory too] and  all the vegetables(except green leaves ) and all types of vegetables oil(except mustard oil ) act like poison for a very sensitive pneumonia patient or a covid 19 affected patient(only in some cases because some patients' body act overwhelmingly on covid 19 virus ) because these things are most inflammatory and the main causes to make humans body inflamed . so avoid these things for some days if you get affected with covid 19. covid 19 may affect you and you can face all types of it's symptoms , but it never be fatal for you if you follow these natural tips for some days after being getting affected. if you have a covid 19 positive test, control your eating habits strictly for some days and take only the described foods because it is zero inflammatory. you should eat all types of meaty foods( meat, fish and eggs ) and  you can use mustard oil or pure butter clarified to cook them otherwise eat them grilled or boiled. you can also have all types of pure dairy products(which are made from pure animal milk ) , white sugar, sea salt, red chili powder,all types of green leaves like spinach and lettuce,tea, coriander powder or leaves, , turmeric, products that made from pure wheat, masoor dal(pigeon food),gram(checkpeae ), mustard oil. avoid all types of vegetables, either it is a green vegetable or a root (besides green leaves) and avoid cabbage and cauliflower . it is a very strict diet plan but with this diet you can achieve zero inflammation within 10 to 15 days. to meet your daily needs of vitamin c you can take a half  of lemon(lemon acts differently when it is consumed with different foods, with the suggested foods it never be a cause for inflammation ) per day. if you follow this tip for some days, covid 19 or it's variants never never be fatal for you in any case .  note - a human body does take 15 days to produce antibodies  and it is the natural way to avoid the over inflammation. it is my twenty years experience over  pneumonia and inflammation. it's been two years i won't face neither pneumonia nor inflammation. i have been surviving on a very simple and a very strict diet. to watch how inflammation kills the patient, click on the following link. https://youtu.be/okg7uq_hrhqhttps://youtu.be/okg7uq_hrhq to know vaccine afficacy on covid 21.  click on the following link https://youtu.be/1bgbjuwhjgohttps://youtu.be/1bgbjuwhjgo https://youtu.be/gsummgcm5iwhttps://youtu.be/gsummgcm5iw https://youtu.be/g0g5cq0ue50https://youtu.be/g0g5cq0ue50 https://youtu.be/cq1vnkhi8pchttps://youtu.be/cq1vnkhi8pc https://youtu.be/gfawosinv6shttps://youtu.be/gfawosinv6s https://youtu.be/d6nupzlitn4https://youtu.be/d6nupzlitn4 https://youtu.be/lkyhqllitguhttps://youtu.be/lkyhqllitgu https://youtu.be/kkci-7e83mihttps://youtu.be/kkci-7e83mi https://youtu.be/_vxe9pjrqcshttps://youtu.be/_vxe9pjrqcs to know how did i come to know to this thing please read, my story, by clicking on the following link.  https://harshhamde.blogspot.com/?m=1https://harshhamde.blogspot.com/?m=1. and to know how you can wash your nose with hot water to kill the virus from nose. click on the following link.https://youtu.be/1wescmnduw0....https://youtu.be/1wescmnduw0....."

"its a choice, not mandatory, why suddenly sound not a part of citizen anymore. its a choice to take other jab as well even before covid appear, does tat mean as long whoever din take any jab will have to bear every cost on own even the gov had taken aside cpf contributions , taxes etc from every citizen. so haveyoutaken every single jab tat is a available in the world or in singapore? again vaccination is a choice, it shouldn't get any discrimination , unfairness or punishment to bear cost etc at all. its only a failure that the gov or the world failed to convince those not getting vac. trust is involve."

this guy can really sleep well at night with so many deaths everyday ?
i'm not sure if they can really sleep well at night? but i pretty sure that i cant sleep well if i have no $$. e.g. cant even pay off of bills.
evil demon like this guy can sleep very well because he is borned from the devil
"frankly, wrong terminology to use the word “brakes” just like pm said we must ‘respect’ the virus  !!!! why not the virus respects us ? never knew pm’s vocabulary is so poor ! do you know you are being bias when you apply your so-called ‘brakes’ ?  your brake is to allow only 2 people out of 5 to take a taxi unless these 5 are from the same family and proven vaccinated.  you allow full load for public buses and mrts and people talk like nobody’s business ! where is your logic ? such a law is discouraging people from dining out and taxi business is badly affected besides eateries and restaurants. instead of dying from covid, singaporeans will die of hunger and mental stress ! are you aware singapore got the first covid case from the couple from wuhan because we refused to shut our borders ? can india be safe for us ? if you think it is safe then open up to malaysia too ? worst of all, you miss out putting the brake on quarantine ! in fact all overseas visitors must be quarantined as you cannot tell if they are asymptomatic ? i read about cases in the past developed symptoms half-way through the quarantine even though tested negative initially ? not from only one batch but several batches."
"by fencing up hawker centers allowing only 2 openings, do you know your ‘’brake’ causes people jamming these 2 openings causing human traffic jam ...no more social distancing !"
i hope there is no breakout of fire in the shopping malls. if it does big problem for people to escape !
they are worshipping the virus!!
geez man... it is against nature ???? an economist trying to explain the nature of coronavirus ? i really wonder whether he knows anything about the sars-cov-2 virus and in particular the delta variant and all its 100+ sub-lineages  and why this particular variant has become the dominant variant now !
"talk again? these knnblcb 3 stooges, just look at their stupid faces, youtube got better stuff, let me give you a thumbs down cna"
living with no. of deaths due to covid.. quite sad and unfortunate for such norm
"life is short , good deeds are the real bank account for us ... there will be a judgement day for everyone , at least i can sleep in peace every night hehehehe"
"when is this ""at some point""? when everyone has contracted covid!!!"
it simply means covid will be around but cases will ease once we have better immunity.  try to read some world news to understand
"coshinc of course with the majority of us infected with covid, singapore achieves herd immunity.  the results are the same as without a minister-in-charge. so why do we need minister ong?"
chiaoeng chia  why do we need chiaoeng chia?🤣🤣
they are confused and are undecided!
"they are not confused. if they are, they will not have the political courage to pull back to dine for 2 and ban the unvaccinated from the malls and hawker centres. these are hard decisions.soft politicians won't make such decisions"
masks ; don't work. vaccines ; don't work. boosters ; will not work. no word about natural immunity and alternative medication and treatments. these sick bastards have sold this country to pfizer.
点踩的比点赞的多，这就是民意
talk about planning.... now they approved sinovac ! hahahahahahahahaha
causing distress for family? why stress without maids
"soon fdw will have more gathering with fw. think sda will go out from comfort zone like aircon mall,  shady places to check on these ppl at interchange and parks? 😂"
yeah fresh meat from ph
blab....blab....blab.....like living in planet blab.....no new info except cut n paste from who directives
honestly there are only 2 questions to answer 1. do you think the vaccine is effective? 2. are the people who gets hospitalised vaccinated individuals? the rest is just moot.
as usual the oppigs only know kpkb. smart move oyk.
"stop talking lah minister ong, no one will callyoua mute ifyoukeep your mouth shut"
everything got excuses
is this the same clown that extended covid restrictions to nov 2021? why he open boarders?
he needs it for his family's real estate business
"20 oct 2021 pap : covid-19 restrictions extended to nov 21, more time needed to stabilise situation 23 oct 2021 pap : lets open our boarders"
"and the worst part... let's open to south asia, malaysia and indonesia...."
"joe kerr even india, bangladesh, vietnam.  what an opening of border. what a joke."
alzario india is doing waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy better than singapore at the moment by the way. cases have been steadily declining for the last 3 months and a big part of the population is vaccinated too
"mp ong i dont like your speech! you addressed pro ma correctly? you are high in position? while pro ma lower? pro ma address you accordingly, but you? please treat the professional with respect!"
sad to see no one is appreciating  these hardworking dedicated people 😢.
waityoujoking right?
it’s the poor civil servants and workers.
"fully vaccinated can still be infected and can still transmit to others, so why is it safer to allow only fully vaccinated foreigners into singapore?"
😂
"open up travellers to 6 more countries; exponential rise in cases, clusters n deaths after ndp. cannot even manage own backyard still open flood gates to risk importation of covid-19.  more restrictions for citizens. muppet logic"
chances of them transmitting is lower is it not?
they bring money? it's all about money money money...
"sew boy if they are infected, there is no or lesser symptoms ie no sign or warning,youcan’t even tell, making them super spreaders.  that’s the reason why the more you vaccinate, the more cases there are.  now out of control"
sew boy no not lower.
"cn, maybe gov hope vaccinated less chance of falling serious ill to the point of dying and have utilise our overloaded hospital. otherwise, they just recover at home."
"boo tre . sia cash depleting and  eu airports force asia airlines inculding sia to start flying there, or loose the landing slot. there we go.🤷 hospital capacity should follow up to be able to handle the increase cases, accordingly to mr ong plan."
do not vote pap.
"open up for money lah! singapore so small, no money all die. im sure singapore reserve all paper number. maybe inside 0?🤷🏻‍♀️"
tell the one talking about chinese privilege  tell him to in charge covid  why  hum ji ?  ceca rats  rats steal things from others and spread ceca variants
"we have a very careless pap minister who handled the covid-19 case unprofessional before he open the boarder. he never thinks the hospital is capable to handler huge local covid-19 patient, they are good for nothing. they are not capable of judging the future out come and safety of singaporean, i think prime minister pick them from scrap yard. none of them is professional. we vote them in to control our freedom. they created problem and want us to follow the instruction. they can’t see and predict far what will happen like our pm lee kuan yew, i don’t think they don’t even have 5% experience of good old retire minister"
"his argument is flawed. the vtl only started this week (excluding germany/brunei), of course the imported cases are still low. but give it time, the imported cases will rise and spread to the community and singaporeans who have been following the rules are the ones who suffer. pls be consistent in your policies. if borders are open, then singaporeans should be allowed to gather in groups of more than 2. there’s currently one standard for the rich and expats (they can afford to travel with families and return without quarantine) and another standard for average singaporeans."
now our cases are high if they dare to come let them come la what is the big deal?
ah choon big deal. because they keep talking about hospital and icu being overwhelmed right now. these people coming in will contribute to the community spread (perhaps we will hit 5000 to 7000 cases a day) which means more people will end up in the hospitals and icu. they will use this excuse to introduce more restrictions. who suffers in the end? ordinary singaporeans like us.
middle finger
do not vote pap.
open border for outside countries with delta virus and not open border with malaysia-pure game with singaporeans
"minister ong, minister ong, where do i start? firstly, if going downhill is dangerous, you should turn back. if cannot turn back, get off your bike & walk. it's much safer. secondly, the 3 brakes. 1st brake - """"border restrictions so that we don't import large numbers of infected travellers.'' why are we allowing infected travellers in in the first place? and letting travellers in, infected or not, is not applying a brake, it's increasing the gear. 2nd brake, administer vaccines and booster shots. yes it will work for a while but once the vaccine wanes off, the infections will increase and you see huge waves again. this is not a long term solution. you cannot expect citizens to go for booster shots every 3-6 mths. is the merck type medication in the long term plan?  we know the virus will be here to stay at least for the next 18-24 mths or even forever. what is the long term plan? 3rd brake - domestically apply safe management measures. i think these have been existence since day 1. it's just you have been revising numbers every few mths.   your reasoning for us being able to open up more travel lanes is because we have higher infection rates than other countries? so the message is come at your own risk? singapore is known to the world as a safe, clean and beautiful garden city. pls don't destroy that image.  you mentioned a key priority is to protect the vulnerable. many of these are the elderly and the unvaccinated. however, your data shows an infected person can infect up to another 6-8 persons. so why not get those infected to recover elsewhere and not in their own homes. since many only have mild or no symptoms, they won't really need too much medical help. may i ask if the rapid rise of the cases is due to family members getting infected? many are living with elderly and the young and these are are the people you want to protect.   you are easing up border restrictions to reduce the labour shortage for construction projects. right now the dorms are also facing rising cases. are you ensuring we have sufficient and appropriate facilities to house these migrant workers? pls don't let there be a 3rd fiasco."
"write so much for what 😂😂😂 if you're really so good, you should be in the hospital making decisions 🤣🤣👍"
"🥱 yawn..tiring .the long and winding road, that leads...."
"bmpcos chitchat hmm....i wonder what your true intentions are.  you are not helping the government, you are making it worse for them mocking our concerns & comments. are you truly a supporter of government or intentionally trying to turn people against them?"
"wonder why cases skyrocketed after 85% of the population are vaccinated? the truth is, vaccine is the virus."
why dine in only allow 2 but open border ? no answer....
"hello? for people to enter the country, there is a need to show pcr result prior to arrival? for dine in, do you do pcr result before eating? which is of a higher risk?"
jeremy chng how effective is the pcr? travellers from some of these countries are bold enough not to wear mask in their homeland. what make you think they are safe to come. 😂
"flip flop... with this policies, open close open close.. imnunity decrease, by the timeyoureopen.. immunity of a recovered patient is 0. the bubbleyoumaking didnt work  doesnt work and wont work.ur strategy has no logic,youare just selling fairy tales. if this is 6 to 8 ratio, howyoucompare it with flu ?yousay 6 months, state thatyouall will resign if this turns to be a lie like everything else i said or a fail like everythingyoudid so far. solution, go eu or us where life is back"
why divide sporeans unvaccinated/vaccinated into north and south korea man propose god dispose

these people never understand
"covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated.  covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant.÷"
"there are simply too many comments that are out to destabilise this http://nation.it/nation.it has become our culture to blame without knowing the facts. i think it is worth to note the following: deaths per million: us, uk, france, italy, spain: 2000/ million germany, netherlands: 1000/ million  malaysia: 800/ million qatar, uae : 200/ million  spore: 50/ million yet , all the negative comments are finger pointing at the authorities. this is the new singapore"
"by opening earlier before the clusters were subdued, you guys should have known cases will balloon out of control and as a result more people will die. why the rush? for economic benefit ? but at what cost.while people can accept there will be deaths, it could have been reduced if you controlled those clusters first before opening rather than back track and semi lock down again and give all kinds of analogies or excuses after the damage done and hospitals having capacity issues.your main priority is to look out for the well being of the people of this country.don't lose track on why you are in government in the first place."
else how to pay most expensive pm on the planet n $660/annum to mayors for dunno doing what  ?
the suicide rates has been going up during the lockdown.

vincecarlo.still painful?
u have to discriminate against the unvaccinated cause they are taking up hospital resources
"vaccine mandate is a dark global agenda, you are naive to think that the vaccine differentiation is a domestic decision/blame game"
"nothing says ""endemic"" about these restrictions haha"
vance kang they have their legitimate reason and they pay taxes too. even unvax that had survive covid had better immunity than vax. there are people that had medical reason too. ... you are one narrow minded person.
j i they claim endemic but sire they failed to later implement more restriction.
justfair theres nothing to be painful when one had done no wrong? its the person that create bad karma that will eventually be painful when the time comes.
"vincecarlo yes to be expected ,there are many"" balls"" carrier ."
stem insight theres no mandate to be vaccinated because its  experimental.
john 5864  it is now the pandemic of the mrna vaccinated  spreading n spreading n spreaders  more n more n more deaths  thank you 🎪🤡

where's the living with covid part??
onky living with covid ever changing restrictions.
it is all about $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ this is the thanks which pap has given the seniors who supported them all these years.  the young should not make the same mistake.

abcde 000  please don't insult our founding father. we are doing okay with deaths at a relatively low of 50 / million compared to thousands/ million in western countries.  blame less may be helpful to you
"justfair what if one of the deaths was you? sure, i will tell your parents to blame less"
justfairyoucant get a decent job outside? why resort to shilling as a pap ib for a pittance? is that how you bring food to the table?
deep one  you dare not receive my reply yet you are making yourself a nuisance again.dont think people of different views than yours are ibs. and stop thinking that you have liberty to post all the falsehoods like you could in toc.
justfair liar! toc isnt  my cup of tea la. no wonder yr world is so small. can prove you are able get a decent job other than a shameless pap ib tasked to patrol  gvt sites? cannot right?

"justfair are you sure that it is ok  to report death everyday? only you and the pap are ok with it, but not we. please, next time think first when you write in the post, that is not the way to support the pap by saying it is ok with the death number compare with the other country. pap supporter nowadays, really low standard, this type of comment, you can write it. are you a representative for pap?"
"st talk  haha i am not a supporter of any party.i am a supporter of singapore.  we are duty bound to help this country overcome covid. before you pick on me, tell me frankly. have you read the other damming comments and can you tell me whether they are helpful to this country? just the one above you about 18th hell. be fair in your comment please"
justfair i had said what you have said. you really look like your supporter. deny things that have said from their mouth.
st talk  that is your unilateral conclusion.  the difference between you and me is i don't around to do g bashing. i am more concerned on how we can solve this together ad a nation.  i asked you questions but you evade
justfair wow.! you really look like the person who like to brat about himself for applying good strategy on covid 19.
st talk  not true. i dont object for the sake of bashing the g. i want the country to overcome this. i guess that's the difference between us. your profile name shows a lot of your intentions
"come on, tell us the truth about vtl, tell us which companies, countries have lobbied for reopening. the government is willing to do this despite rising number of cases everyday and at the expense of your healthcare workers, we should at least know who is going to benefit from this. and please stop saying that your measures are there to relieve stress on the healthcare system, because they clearly aren't. it's amazing how someone can say this with such conviction on national television then go on and do something totally opposite, what a politician."
"err the 6 new south asia countries added like will have only workers and students coming in. if they confident to bring more worker, ease restricition for us also."
"and openly tell us they’ve invested in pfizer. if this isn’t conflict of interest, what is? how many ministers have stocks in pfizer, declare lah."
"alnir zaly should be temasek or gic has shares, in order to secure the vaccine supply for singapore. so we can get it before other countries which we did. other countries gov also invested in vaccine companies. the vaccine is not that useful is another matter. don't think any ministers personally have share in pz, like you mention that would be conflict of interest, pocketing profit from this🙅🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️"
"eric phua bloomberg already announced temasek has invested. now who’d know if respective individuals wouldnt be tempted to make a good buck from this. i’m not saying they are but if they did, citizen lives would appear so so cheap, if it’s not already."
"alnir zaly . sigh**, they all from good school, should know what is right, what is wrong. maybe we do need to worry so much. i am hoping  mr ong beef up the hospital capacity since now gate open, maybe increase in cases later on."

<b>a gym near a restaurant can blast music while instructor yelling at the sweaty and maskless attendees while the restaurant itself cannot even play a pipe music and only allowed 2 diners per table and is that what its meant by inconsistency or is it just simply a plain illiteracy to understand the obvious logic ?? so can someone please spare me the agony</b>
singapore run by puppet master n his muppets
vincecarlo  warped minds warped logic
go back to bounty hunting please. don't complain so much. :)
"schadenfreude  haha, they are deaf i think"
it is simple actually when you use your logic. people who goes to a gym is 100% healthy people. while people who goes to a restaurant are not
"one is enjoying the other is suffering alsoyouneed music to workout to, diningyouneed music for wat? let them eat and chit chat longer while eating? cannot tahan just close restaurants and open gyms so simple why be so entitled? if you so smart why not join pap?"
schadenfreude i am bounty hunting for fairness and its a constructive feedback and not complaint cos gym is a place to workout quietly during pandemic with no music and shouting are required cos its not singing or dancing competition.
r tim f&b hawker and all food outlets are daily essential cos people need to eat and its considerable to play light music to soothe the atmosphere  while gymn seems non essential for the general public especially for the kids and elderly also anyone can workout at home with own music played on or do it outdoor while enjoy the bird singing in the nature so lets be logical about what people really need essentially during this pandemic crisis.
boba fett sorry but when did hawker centre have music? soothing music is used to charge high prices for atmosphere which isn't essential as most singaporean cannot afford those atas places
do not vote pap.
r tim many fastfood outlets have played music or radio station through speaker so this outlets atas is it ?
"boba fett ya sure atas restaurants are non essential best is to close shop and open fast food restaurant and play radio ifyouthinkyoucan, rather than sulking in social media"
r tim its not about sulking or fretting on social media but its all about giving a constructive feedback on how to lay out a concrete measures that are seamless and simple to all to understand cos music makes the people come together but food makes everyone come closer to civilisation.
boba fett obviously this pandemic they do not want people to come together.  they want people to reduce interaction work from home restrict group size and having soft music in atas food places only makes people stay longer. even ktv is banned. dont compare apples and oranges
r tim then dont compare durian with chempedak cos simply if dont want people to come together then why there are rallies and award variety shows and parade and also millions of people commuting on public transport and above 90% population living in hdb and condos and isnt that already close enough and tell me now is mata kuching and longan are the same ?
"covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from infection or fully vaccinated.  covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the variant."

deep one ok thank you 🙏 😃

deep one it’s hyena like to ate anus
i am still confused ..sitting with strangers in a train or bus and yet i cannot sit next to my closest of friends...this is utter nonsense!
honestly even a preschool kid and elderly are all confused with these inconsistencies measures cos its weird illogical and totally out of this world.
thanks a lot sir 🙏
make it simple. just explain.
i think many people who self tested art positive will keep quiet if they have no symptoms. so these silent infection will not get reported in the daily infection rate.
"if not seriously ill until needs to go icu, they got no time to care also. all ownself take care ownself. that mr. ong home recovery."
"with the new 1-2-3 health protocol, you won't be tested with pcr unless you're admitted to hospital with major symptoms or complications! with pcr tests now reserved only for the necessary, the mtf is officially under-reporting the daily case figures! soon, they won't even do pcr tests; no test = no case! what a brilliant mtf!"
"eric phua if not seriously ill and you go hospital, you are actually exposing yourself to more infection risks. hospitals full of germs."
kclee hospital also can't handle more people now. not dying one all home recovery🤣
keep changing ur rules see who die first...good job 👏
"wow banned dining and malls for unvax isnt enough. coming soon on 1st jan. banned from going back to workplaces. so how are the citizens of singapore going to survive and live? yet they say the vaccine is not mandatory""."
thanks a lot sir
"china can’t look to singapore for a way to live with covid-19, health economist says. - singapore’s “experiment” to live with the coronavirus –  and its subsequent spike in infections – might not be a useful model for china. “this safety net protecting the health of 1.4 billion people did not come easily. we can’t let it go just like that,”  li ling, from  peking university’s national school of development."
there are already more than 100+ sub-lineages of the delta variants to greet the singaporeans soon ! the most dangerous are delta + e484k or delta + e484q because these mutations can evade the antibodies and the body immune system.
"we are heading towards oyk becoming pm, due to his awesome brownie points these few months."

"as film director always said.  have you memorise the script? okay,  take 1 action!!! 😂"
i will say it will take another year and i believe there is a new variant soon
covid 19 shown that it is more resistance. more mutations of virus. haha let's see a new variant
isn't what we doing .we are doing crazy measure to allow home recovery and let the virus spread in community
i cannot wait for delta plus e484k or e484q to pay singapore a visit... then we will talk !
"on oct. 19, the bill and melinda gates foundation announced that it would be setting aside 120 million dollars to ensure merck’s experimental coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) drug, molnupiravir, is made available to people in lower-income nations. merck’s drug is aimed at combating mild to moderate covid-19 cases. no wonder all of a sudden, all the mainstream media were boasting about this super pill. very powerful background obviously."
<b>inconsistency strategy may do more harm than good to livelihood cos inconsistency seems like a random nick and pick to trim down a problem momentarily while the root of it keeps growing and what it reaps will spread out uncontrollably so logically its advisable to be wise when making such statement and start to develop a more concrete plan that is seamless and easy to follow</b>

rubbish !!! you are mad !
"this rush to open borders for the south asians, malaysia and indonesia is just waiting for another disaster to happen !"
forgot something: it’s called mutations
"yes, the health minister is clueless about healthcare. the only credibility he has is being in the pap."
xian seah that was during lky times. now being in the pap is seen as mercenary.
"even with 4000 cases a day, how long does it take for the stabilisation minister ong is talking about? if we do the math, it will take 1000 days for 4mil to be infected and have ""resistance against the virus increase progressively"" as stated in his speech. that is 3 years, not 3- 6months. the initial goal was to get majority of us, vaccinated, and now the goal is to get vaccinated, then infected to build resistance against the virus progressively. and what if another variant comes along? we may have to start getting infected and building this resistance again.  whether we ease measures now, 3months later or 6 months later, infections will still rise. we either bite the bullet sooner or later, unless we are willing to wait 3years. but it is simply not feasible to remain in this semi-lockdown state for so long. we have to move on."
"what if more than 4000, somewhere like 10k. just hope covid death don't spike too much. pity the medical workers who have to deal with this."
most impt question: why do voters like to elect stupid idiots to lead singapore to more deaths.
pap haven't come to terms they can't control a natural disaster like a pandemic like they could singaporeans. their schedule might work for forcing singaporeans to adhere to policies but the virus is omnipotent and omnipresent.
jesus is coming back to earth to resolve everything. repent.
nonsense.

"aiyo, no need so many measure one, people still going out, mall so crowded everyday, queuing so long haha, is ok, no problem, many seem like care about those vulnerable , but body very honest, every day whole family jalan jalan fill out the mall."
"if shopping mall no traffic, you will needs to bring in even more tourists to shop. or all shipping mall close shop? what do you want?"
thank you minister ong for your status report on the covid 19 situation in singapore. it gives us confidence knowing  the task force's thinking in leading us to become a covid-19 resilient nation.
i hope you have parents and grandparents above 60+....

"no normalcy will come. we will have to be vaccinated every six months for life because that is the agenda. and the future vaccines will likely be paid from our medisafe. the shots will become more and more expensive. whether we take the shots or resist them, our money will still be deducted. this is my theory for what is to come. i hope i am wrong."
they vexsinate you continuously to prepare for the forced mark of the beast in the name of buying and selling revelation 13 v 16-18 revelation 14 v 9-11 revelation 19 v 20 forced everyone small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on his/her right hand or on his/her forehead............ all bible prophecies are coming to pass quickly!!
"i quote him, ""at some point, infection numbers will not go up anymore. no transmission wave will last forever."" yeah this i highly agree. when more people are infected, in time, the remainder of people left to be infected is lesser also. let me elaborate in simple math. a school of 1000 students. each day of october, 20 students get infected. and after 1 month, only left 400 left whom not infected. november only left 400 at risk compared to october got 1000 at risk. soo infections surely go down right? or better still days go by and by end november left only 100 not infected and 900 already infected. by december confirm drop in infected numbers right? take this context to the population of singapore.  by saying those 2 statements, does it imply that we are just waiting out the time for more of the population to get infected and pray our elders and children survive all the waves of infection? cause with this strategy eventually there really wont be many left to be infected, and of course numbers and percentages go down, and the wave will eventually disappear. i understand its impossible to predict when it would end. but by generalising that numbers would go down without an time estimate together a solid action plan to change the numbers, just anybody can say for sure it will surely end. when everybody gets infected it will end also what.  just like the life of a human being, it surely end what. whats important is when and how. doctors analyse and can estimate how long and how a person may pass away if there is an adverse medical condition. this analysis of the government and rather redundant statements does somehow show we are just waiting for everybody to get infected. if thats the plan, might as well get this over with and forgo all restrictions."

i think he has some right points。 i had very hard times as caregiver for my hb home recovery. i end up hospital now. we need to move forward!  after vaccine in may my hb got covid on 11 oct 21。 now we look forward for 3rd covid vaccine then travel overseas 2022. no perfect policies and i know elderly die. my own mum still not hv vaccine in overseas because no children dare to let her to be vaccine. let’s god mercy for all eldery.
another mushroom !

sh1tty vaccine. change my mind.
why??? really? cause our corrupt officials are looking after their wallets while letting us die because of this clowns bad decisions of letting foreigners in throughout the whole process while keeping us locked in.
now lord of brakes and rings too😴😴😴😴😴
we’re just waiting to die at this point.
"it’s all about breaking your spirit and making you fall in line. slowly but surely, and at a pace that everyone isn’t even noticing it… compare now to a year ago when we had no deaths and only a fraction of these restrictions. the vaccine causes mutations and spread. but hey, let’s get another booster jab for a vaccine which already mutated and doesn’t help!"

"is it also against nature that germany, russia and uk are having a new wave now? nature dictates that organisms adapt to survive, and covid mutates to survive with every new person it infects. living with covid only gives covid a much higher chance to adapt to our current vaccines and antibodies. you can’t be sure that we will live with 100-200 cases a day in the future because it is not happening anywhere else in the world. russia, uk and germany are showing you your future path."

unfortunately it wouldn't be so simple. who would not fight to keep their million dollar salaries despite all their failures to date. imagine painting deaths and high infection rate as a success....😏😏😏. with their actions they should've proven to singaporeans their resolve not in handling the crisis but in pleasing their overlord
pls get a better grp in the mtf they r simply asking the public doing bussinesses to change ifyoucannot survive tru this pandemic but there is no improvement to this grp of people wat should we do

"before its was max group of 5, then group of 5 fully vaccinated,  now group of 5 fully vaccinated from the same household if r rate smaller then 1.   whats next?  booster shot required?  no more restrictions now!!!"
"we mass vaccinated, tightened restrictions to more than we had over a year ago, and we manage to get thousands of daily cases and a dozen daily deaths. makes you wonder if the vaccine and restrictions cause this. there’s no other explanation for it."
"destroyer74 , i'm guessing that most people don't follow restrictions anymore as well as a year ago..."
i would say either make up their minds to properly fight covid or just bloody give up. either open up fully or shutdown fully for a good 1 to 3 months and clean house then open up to covid safe countries. constant flipping and then flopping on your collective pap face isn't exactly the way promote confidence in our leaders

ychong ong  well said 👍👍
wah very surprise ong knew delta is very transmissable  !!!
you probably don't know right?
😂
is a joke that singapore is so unstabilised with high 85% vac  now but all the 3rd world countries has been stabilised for quite some time and allowing the influx of this ft .
"two brakes need to be applied one on his mouth, another one on lawrence wong's mouth. how they feel no shame lying to singaporeans everyday i cannot understand. what changed when we had less than 50 deaths in one and a half years then compared to more than 250 deaths in the last few weeks. we did not ease our safety protocols. we did not ease our border controls. the only thing that changed was we vaccinated 84% of our population. still cannot connect the dots? and for those who want to use the delta variant as an excuse, the first case was reported in october 2020. way before our first vaccination."
"all the strategies are not working. in this stage to break the spreading, government should implement two weeks fully locked down followed by another two weeks restriction for example working from home mandatory during restrictions. fully one month , the nation can overcome this situation."
"there is no strategy. it’s reacting to various issues without careful thinking, and lousy execution. i do think lockdown is beyond us now. i’ve always advocated lockdown but we need to know how to handle a lockdown….i don’t think the government knows how, going by how they screwed up without being tight. and maybe that’s why they want to open up - so that they can find excuses and do not need to handle the groundwork. anyway, with everybody basically spreading to everybody now, the practicalities of a lockdown are probably impossible for us to handle."
"we mass vaccinated and only now we have thousands of daily cases and a dozen dying each day. yeah, that can’t be caused by the vaccines right? i can only say thank you for protecting the unvaccinated from the vaccinated. i will be refusing any regular nasal testing, and if i’m not allowed to wfh next year, it’s bye job and bye singapore."
we have achieved more than 80% herd immunity but yet we are still dealing with this mess and thats confusing.
👍

"jimi hendralin jimi hendra lim  thanks for the reply. let me ask you one simple question.  which ruling party in the world has ever help opposition to be elected into parliament or congress or senate ? you must be naive right ? in my opinion, if everything is smooth and well, there is less chance for opposition to show their worth. now we have covid, a national issue, why are the opposition suddenly hiding? where is dr tan cheng bock? where is lim tean or chee soon juan?  they bo chap  right. not their business. so how can they build political capital?  i understand. if they say something wrongly, they might lose politics capital. but isn't life is about taking a stand in the interest of the country ? so can we trust the opposition?  you decide"

"haha,  i think psle  math never set the highest risk level question before"
singapore is like that one kid that everyone know farted yet still continue to geng! what a joke!!!

"eric phua haha, will my wlecome you ?"
"my world . properly no if compare covid situation. so it does not benefit malaysian here in singapore who want to go home to visit their famaily in my? just mainly to bring in even more workers one way? if so those already here don't benefit much, as they would like to go home and come back. or they bring their famaily here?🤣🤣🤣"

do you realise that everyone will be infected with covid sooner or later? no one can remain closed forever unless its china
the joke is on us...mismanagement at the highest level...
melike red this shows these ministers live in their own bubble world reading the statistics getting high salaries and hv no ideas of what actually happens in the real world.
consistent inconsistencies?😵‍💫
utter failures!! repeating mistakes with no qualms!!
complaining complianter
50 to a million.. very grateful already
"lol this stupid comparisons with bicycles sounds good in a school essay paper assignment but not on real world. they have zero logic in terms of their policies implementation. restaurants cant play music and allows only 2 vaccinated people, yet right across the restau i am dining in is a gym group of unmask people with loud music and an instruction yelling… how is that logical? they need to sack all these overpaid script readers ministers and put in real experts. zero logic"

hoping these people in the comments do a better job than pap! i support you!!!!
can somebody ask him hard questions?
"he won’t reply. he has fudged issues before. i remember an opposition mp suggesting minimum wage for the lowest paid people and oyk asked who to fund. opposition mp suggested minister’s salary, giving a small number of people that would benefit. so minister’s salary would fund x persons. oyk responded saying minister’s salary cannot build a primary school, what more minimum wage and brushed off the opposition party arrogantly, like a victorious debate. what has primary schools got to do with the minimum wage? and the worse was how he brushed aside the opposition candidate. at least, this is how i remembered it."
he has umbrage issues too huh
"cannot. cause all the reporters and questions have already been pre-selected and prepared before hands. imagine if someone asked an unplanned questions and they can't open their mouth, they'll look really really bad! so don't trust such press conference (more like publicity conference) ..."

"i don’t understand why i can literally sit next to dozens of strangers on the mrt but cannot sit to eat with my family in a restaurant. sorry, still am confused 😐"
becauseyoutake off mask whenyoueat. in mrt everyone has a mask on
because everyone’s wearing a mask on the train while no one’s wearing a mask in the restaurant
"because you're not unmasked in the mrt and you're not talking to them face to face without a mask, sharing food. that is the key difference. hope this helps you to get out of your confused state."

destroyer74 was the point of this msingapore to tell usyoulive 50m from scott's square and you'd like to be unmasked while walking? coz being in public spaces with masked people carries much less risk than being in a restaurant with unmasked people. hope this helps your confusion while walking down the orchard belt.
"if restrict to 5 people sit in a restaurant., it will help to  make less travellers in mrt also."
don't try to argue logic with mtf. they don't operate at the logical level.
"i also don't understand, why bus and train don't need to have 1 meter safe distance ???? maybe covid don't have ezlink card.. 🤔🤔🤔🤔"
daphnemaia still some are talking loudly (because of their masks) in crowded buses.!!
sorry don’t understand. how do you sit next to dozens of people in mrt? that sounds not right. you only sit next to 2 peoples. and its not even as crowded since millions are still wfh. gosh . all these comments are very toxic
mask off in restaurant.... that is the problem. so when will this will ever end.
lim chye hock agreed

thenyoudon't sit in mrt loh...stand in mrt. simple
marx  which is more important in preventing covid spread.. wear mask or wash hands?
daphnemaia how dumb can someone be. most cases are infected in public and work places. even hospital with stricter regulations have been a cluster. are these ppl not wearing mask when moving around?  with or without mask anyone can get infected especially in public transport.  ever heard of the news before or just be ignorant.
buy a bentley ifyoucant take the public transport lol!
"i still can't comprehend the recent tightening measures, technically, 84% of the population had been vaccinated, children that aren't able to vaccinate consist abt 9.2% (no restrictions to mall or hawker center), as to say there's about only 7% of the population whom are unfit and uncomfortable with the vaccine.  implementing of tighten measures just to stop that 7% people of the population, in economy of scale ... make no sense! how much does the gov have to use just for the 7% of the population?!?!  shouldn't mandatory for vaccination makes more sense?"
the measures affect everyone. vaccinated persons can only hang out in groups of 2 too . mandatory vaccination might not be possible since the vaccines are only approved for emergency/pandemic uses.
"nuremburg code. you cannot force or coerce people to inject something without their informed consent. the penalty for violating that is death, even the ones who are just following orders."

there are announcements almost every alternate days. please think through your strategies and policies before making another announcement.
"you want them to say one time and that's it. we shall follow that until the virus disappeared.  ever heard of the word "" update ""?"
bmpcos obviously you are not familiar with the difference between strategies and policies from an update. please analyse previous announcements and try to comprehend before making such ignorant statement.
"bmpcos go ahead and support this agenda, earn that dirty money and watch karma play it’s part. you’d be lucky if you get to see karma face to face."
alnir zaly  no need to use http://threats.you/threats.you are making karma judgement on the majority of sporeans. not healthy way of debate or sharing.  don't threaten
bmpcos you’ll remember my name when it hits you. no threaten. so don’t be frightened. carry on your “good deeds”. 👍🏽
alnir zaly  like this all world leaders would be gone by your little spell🤣🤣🤣
alnir zaly  why do you spare the whole cabinet? plus the silent opposition members? spell not powerful enough?
"it is not announcement,  but lame speech scripted to fill their own belly for the day."
"congrats!! since you oyk took over moh, daily cases and deaths have been hitting the roof, with 3,862 new cases and 14 deaths, 8 vaccinated and 8 not vaccinated on 22 october 2021 yesterday. in the meantime, the unvaccinated are discriminated, banned from entry to malls and even hawker centres, while the news media biased reports pit the vaccinated against the unvaccinated, to divide and rule, instead of unity to overcome this crisis. the only decent thing now you must do is to resign immediately!!!"
because they don bother local livelihood only want economy gain must well don dorn mask for those fully 3 vaccinated.

right you saying .how suffer people in singapore  2 years already . sometimes covid rule not logic  we not understand . 1 meter distance or not also this virus can spread flying over the place  .
malu (shame)now..sinovac is included in national vaccination program. why last time reject? because its made in china. lol
because it cuts into their sales quota with pfizer contract
soon singaporean will not be able to travel if our infected cases keep rising.😔😔😔

chy nah big brother  cannot offend
why singapore opening boarders? easy. money minded don’t see you opening boarders to 3rd world countries eh? their currency too small to entice you?
is that necessarily wrong though?
"didnt they just announce opening borders to bangladesh, pakistan, india, myammar etc etc earlier today? hardly 1st world countries."
"if singapore citizens go out and come back to singapore is not restricted, the restrictions only other than singaporean .this also will affect the spreading of virus."
"gerald lim think… ceca, foreign workers working for subana, temasek… all about money so any liability is only its people n national funds, expect many tax increase."
opening is definitely in line with global order. we are not north korea
"gerald lim . so for ceca in singapore, can they go back and visit their famaily in india and come back? or one way in to singapore only. did india ban singapore too?"
"gerald lim i have had enough of this denigrating attitude towards india and indians. historically, the term 3rd world refer to the countries that neither allied with the us nor with the soviet block. by that logic, singapore is a 3rd world country too - as it was non-aligned. maybe you forgot the state of singapore in the 70s and 80s. the prosperity to singapore came only after it opened up to the world and its advantageous location in the malacca strait. in india, only a few sectors have been opened up so far e.g. it and software services. yet, india is advanced enough to develop nuclear weapons and send satellites to mars and moon. india even launched a satellite for singapore as well a few years back if i remember correctly. so, thumbs down to your snobby attitude."

yakkies?
you can police the people but not the virus  you can't jail or fine the virus.  get rid of your police state mindset.  the first step towards for progress.
"singapore: 160,000 cases; 280 deaths (population 5.7 mil); 2.8% china: 125,000 cases; 5,600 deaths (population 1.4 bn); 0.01% pap politicians have been saying that singapore must stay ahead of the global competition, so we must bring in more foreign talents to create jobs for not talented singaporeans. so, in which sector of our economy we are ahead of china? even in leadership to contain the spread of covid-19 we are also lagging far behind.  ha ha ha!"
yea..👍 you are absolutely correct
"to begin with, they’re huge, it is likely many have/had covid but go/went undetected. additionally, it’s china. they tried to silence doctors who warned about the virus. how can you possibly think those numbers are accurate and reflective of the real situation in china?"
"china is big. their economy can sustain a prolonged closure because of strong internal demand, that's why they can afford to do that. singapore relies heavily on the rest of the world, that why we must open up. go back to your jc economics lessons and stop spouting nonsense"
"i think singapore is a rare developed nation that can screw up so badly, be so dumb and yet pat ourselves on our back saying we damn solid and allow people to be infected and die without conscience. uniquely singapore."
"time it takes for china to snuff out an outbreak of covid with strict and intense tracing and testing policy is roughly 10 to 12 days. precisely like you pap lovers have claimed, china is large and singapore larger? cause it's definitely taken way longer than 2 weeks now. before you pap shidiots comment, my parents-in-law and a large portion of my friends and business associates are in china. life has literally normalized for a year plus now, all the while our highly paid mps have only aggravated the situation. so while you drink that us produced coolade and diss china's success and agree with the disinformation campaign by western govs and ours. take a look at all the social media sources about life in china now. or is that too much to expect out of you."
"m l no ah. us did the same thing under trump, singapore just following the example like a pathetic groupie for the usa. economy first, people 2nd, when people die of covid create excuses and pretend they died due to underlying conditions as though it wasn't exacerbated by covid, hence covid cause of death. but what to do lky was the goat but lhl and his cronies are nothing but money grubbing, entitled prats."
z bz o
z bz  you are correct! china doesn't need so many foreign workers compared to singapore.
omg just open already if you wanna open borders!! jesus
stay in the middle ground is practical
prefer to lockdown and contain the virus from spreading further everyday. too many unlink cases.
"apparently it’s ok to test people entering and exiting singapore, but do you think they’ll bother testing all the residents? i’ve never been tested and that’s perfectly fine, because healthy people shouldn’t be! they purposely test 30k people daily to get so many false positives. it’s fudging the statistics. the reality is there’s only 40 sick people a day, the 98.7% of others either aren’t sick, or don’t have covid. art tests aren’t very accurate."
"vinicius voon what a clueless response, do you know singapore has hundreds of thousands of flu patients every year, and we have 855 flu related deaths? do you see the govt peddling flu vaccines? locking down singapore? it’s time to stop listening to media lies…"
"if you open 6 more countries, why local still have all these restricitions. what is the purpose?"
vinicius voon  still taking about unlinked? outdated lah
"vinicius voon basically it's already impossible - even lockdown won't stop delta. that's why ""live with covid"" - other countries also do that already. humans lost the covid war."
"so many elderly die,  heaven is watching .. just wait and see."
you are being watched
do not vote pap.
"who ask them not to get vaccinated then? i feel bad for those who are vaccinated and pass on, but if you're unvaccinated by choice, i've no sympathies for them."
z bz  you are right. do your national duty and get vaccinated unless you have a medical reason
"imagine those vaccinated now, 10-20 years later… if not ok, cannot get monthly cpf life anymore, who huat?"
"the four reliance’s taught by the buddha    rely on the truth the teacher teaches, not on his personality. rely on what he means, not on the words he speaks. rely on the real meaning, not on a partial provisional understanding. rely on your wisdom mind, not on judgemental intellect. do not accept any of my words on faith, believing them just because i said them. be like an analyst buying gold, who cuts, burns, and critically examines his product for authenticity. only accept what passes the test by proving useful and beneficial in your life"

"opening of borders to vaccinated persons to singapore via vtl or other avenues need strict controls on the pcr’s test results / certifications. many countries such pcr’s certificates can be falsified or even bought http://illegally.as/illegally.as such, singapore mmtf / moh/ hsa/ ica consider setting up singapore pcr tests & certification centers fully manned & operated by singaporeans at strategic locations / embassies to effectively stamp out false pcr certifications."
"becos the incubation period of delta is 4 days, if a foreigner takes a pre-departure test and test negative, and arrives in spore on the 2nd/3rd day and again test negative on the arrival test, he can still test positive after the 4th day when he is singapore"

eric phua i miss the good ol days when there was zero vaccination with half the death rate now. i also thought newer variants supposed to be less deadly and more transmissible
i hv friends too feeling unwell for months though not so serious. all these r not open data in singaporep n they don’t follow up as proactively as the west. we see some nordic nations stop using moderna  recently but news reporting here does not go into detail why.

we just want a safe singapore.. please don’t be money minded …
see thailand... ppl was so hit hard by the lockdown and suicide rates increases significantly. need to find a middle ground to tackle this problem
tan you liang  you are right.find the middle ground and adjust as we move along.
do not vote pap.
unfortunately that's kind of how capitalism works
"tan you liang because thailand is deeply depending on international tourism  21% of its gdp came from the tourism industry before the pandemic and it creates 8 millon jobs, singapore is not the case"
singapore's public debt is higher than average. they have to care more about money
tan you liang thailand still ban singapore right?
else how to pay most expensive pm on the planet n $660k/annum to mayors for dunno doing what ?
"james lim i wun really say that. but i'll say let's set aside partisan politics and bring in locals like prof tambyah, an infectious expert and tap on this local talent. google his 8-points suggestions to fight covid. the tf can stay to helm the fight, but listen to real medically trained and qualified infectious disease experts. while local movements restriction is acceptable, opening travel corridors to let in travellers to walk all over the land defies logic. how does that help other than boost gdp growth?"
james limi will ask more people to vote for them
s suwandi  you don't care about money?  very nice man
"emeritus david teo  dr tambayah has the same views as the mtf. living with covid, all should vaccinate and boosters  feel disappointed?"
justfair lol are you fluent in english? singapore had debts they have to care for economy first before getting bankrupted like china without electricity!!
s suwandi just give them a thumbs down and ignore these kind. they want your attention.
aiya if lockdown you will say another thing. never trust oppigs.

chitchat  very true. many countries are eyeing at our lunch. most people here think it's a god given privilege
from tunnel to bicycle??? trying very hard to hide those lies !!
"use the same analogy that every 6 person is someone that knows us how lame, infection will go up or now depend on the evolution of the virus if you want to talk about nature, when environment safe it multiplies and if it is hostile it try to gain immortality to ensure it does not dies.  opening borders is because it is money and the same nonsense on control as they are so many cases caught for people who are totally vaccinated that come here and we find they are infected and we place they in health care at singaporean expenses."

do not vote pap.
annoyed cat hear many times🤣🤣🤣
"this point is correct though “forever” might be days or yearsss. “ nothing 2 infect” also assuming no new viruses which is unlikely. till then, vaccinated ones may no longer be organic enough to survive, hence, continue channeling funds to biotechs… good idea, ez profit!"
james lim you can do better?
annoyed cat that’s not what he means. it just means your body’s immunity increases. nothing is always 100%. not even chicken pox friends
not sure where he get the evidence of no transmission last forever from? should go back make kaya toast
you forget indian delta variant spike. now uk variant had not come yet.
"genuine question: does anybody know if i get covid and survived, can i submit my covid survival to have my tracetogether status updated to ""vaccinated""? or do i still have to take the vaccine? (still barred from malls) if i got covid and survived, according to the “science”,  i have the antibodies and immunity. can it be submitted for tracetogether to greenlight me?  i get covid, i quarantine. i go to doctor to get certified on paper that i have covid, then take the paperwork to submit to g to greenlight me on tracetogether. can this be done?"
i cannot find the answer online or on the government websites... does anyone know?
"palm trees very good point but don’t think that’s their objective. commonsense r highly penalised, hence, more rare these days lol"
"even with full vaccination, fatality rate of elderly and those who underlying health conditions are pretty high."
palm trees natural immunity is not recognise in singapore.
john 5864  for real?  you have links to singapore government websites to show their official stance? i want to document it and screencap it.
palm trees there isnt. this means theres no recognition. its all about $ and control. not logic.

when have you become so obedient and naive to believe this .

"open up travellers to 6 more countries; exponential rise in cases, clusters n deaths after ndp. cannot even manage own backyard still open flood gates to risk importation of covid-19.  more restrictions for citizens. muppet logic"

spot on !! very precise information!!👍
approximately only 300 children out of 73 million worldwide have died of covid if you have every job offered to you you can still catch it and still pass it on so we have to ask ourselves why this urgency worldwide to jab everybody of all ages with something that does not give immunity. since when did it become a crime to have a different opinion since when did the opposition parties in every country stop opposing

when is novavax available in singapore?
apparently australian made covax-19 is same as novavax and had been approved in some countries
romi kwan first of all covax is not a vacine but an vacine alliance. next novavax wasn't made by australia. australia only buy novavax this year and originally supposed to ship to australia in mid 2021. but delay thus now they are expecting novavax to arrive in australia in nov 2021. upon arrival also need to be tested before australia will use on their people.
"celestial star https://youtu.be/9x2iehuj8zuhttps://youtu.be/9x2iehuj8zu here the interview of the creator of covax-19, he can explain all"
romi kwan the australia made vacine is not novavax. it's spikogen. singapore government did not even mention will approve this brand or allow it our national vacation program like mrna. it's apple vs mango. just like pifzer vs modena. tho both are mrna but they are not exactly the same thing.
romi kwan i dont know if i can wait until its finally approved by singapore government to be included into the national vaccination programme where if there are side effects after the vaccination i will be protected. i have medical condition so i definitely need something that is in the national programme else i scare i cannot afford to pay for any further treatment if i have side effects.
romi kwan thanks for the link. i will watch it and try to understand it more.
"celestial star and good luck with that, as they will already be 90% vaccinated by then lol. still, who wants to take it when no longer term testing down? definitely not the 6% that are already refusing to be experimented on."
"this is not a case of “pick the least poisonous poison to take just to satisfy the governments mandates”, people will still refuse to be experimented on, there’s been zero long term testing done on any of them, and the risks far outweigh the so-called benefits. covid is still primarily an issue for anyone with multiple comorbidities, which is mostly the very elderly, hence why the average age of death is 80. why should young, healthy people bother taking an experimental drug?"
"destroyer74 hello if you don't want to take then feel free to do so. stop coming here to complain when i want to get my vaccine. if i listen to you dont get vaccine, then you can make sure i won't be restricted from entering mall to do my grocery shopping or freaking just buy takeaway from a mall? and if i catch covid you will pay for my medical fee?"
destroyer74 if you don't know the real situation don't anyhow assume. those unvaccinated got people with health conditions so cannot get yet. some just got cancer treatment or kidney transplant so only can get vaccination after their treatment as those requires them to take medication to suppress their own immune system. these are the people who most likely die if kena covid because our immunity is already very weaken. as someone with serious medical conditions and weaken immune system i feel that i need the novavax if situation in singapore is like this... especially when we going to live with covid. those normal healthy people can dont get they wont die but if i kena there is a super high chance i may die.

"gods amazing grace  nothing has been done right? ok which country has handled this virus from china perfectly? none! everyone suffered, everyone paid a price, numerous trial and errors, because some idiot out there decided to eat a bat! or maybe its a lab leak, no one knows! theres no fixed solution to handling a pandemic.  the fact that people are expecting the government to reduce covid rates and also not touch their freedoms is beyond mind blowing 😂🤦‍♂️ and another thing, it's really astonishing to see the rise of millions of pandemic and economic experts in the span of 2 yrs, in the form of keyboard warriors! amazing stuff 👏"
the next country of free entry to singapore probably will be india. our government always put them ahead of singaporean.  they just can't wait to do just that!
it changing daily!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvi53l6r2nm&t=1m31s1:31 you mention singapore has classified taiwan as 'one of four countries'. please replace 'countries' with 'jurisdictions'. singapore only recognizes taiwan as a part of china.
please open with india also for fully vaccinated people with quarantine measures.

"use virtual reality to ""travel"" lor,  it's safe, convenient and cheaper than actually travelling lol"
no.
"vtl is not as simple as you think. on surface it looks good. there are still many underlying restrictions. like if you fail the pre-departure test, for example in germany, you can only leave for singapore 21 days (if you pass the test) after 1st diagnosis of covid! when you are back to singapore, you can self isolate in your hdb flat room if your other occupants have the same travel history as you. otherwise, you can only self isolate in your hdb flat room with an en-suite toilet or if you don’t have, then must seek for alternative accommodation like approved hotels/facilities!"
which are insurance companies that offer travel insurance with coverage on covid related illnesses (especially overseas hospitalization expenses)?
travel to go see a world full of vaccinated zombies. id rather stay at home. :)
it's all in your head.

i think most of us are waiting for malaysia and batam🤣
nah bro😂😂
"people should just learn to comprehend what endemic means. once you have the vaccine, worse case you just sick at home. for most people, they may be like a normal sick person walking around a bit sick and still go work."
endemic has certain conditions. one of them is herd immunìty and agreement among nation. don't think we have reach that criteria yet. have we achieve herd immunity? do we see a decrease of daily infected? some countries still on locked down and closing border!
"why ""copy"" south china morning post video reporting design?"
whyyoudo this to us... now we like india
hope to travel soon...
travel bubble... burst.
travel burst close again then next year open then close open close no ending
more virus coming in to singapore 🤦🤦. be prepared singaporean. be safe . soon singapore will be like india.
don't worry too much. we have to stay open and keep our connectivity with the world.  we have good and wise leaders. have faith
"so the ministers decided to sacrifice singaporean citizens life and health to allow travel between these countries without quarantine which honestly is just as risky despite their mentioned frequent covid test. do their homework virus is designed such a way that they spread most effectively when they have not developed symptoms which is also when they have not developed enough antibodies to be tested positive! we must hold the leaders accountable if mishap happen and endanger our own love ones such as our own children, parents and grandparents! suggest they don’t play with science because they cannot afford that as this will result in first in history singaporean blaming on them!"
government need money 💰💰💰. so open borders!!! that's why they keep asking ppl to go for vaccines!  soon singapore cases will go up and up 🤦🤦🤦 because of the government!!!
this is under vaccinated travel pass. only vaccinated travelers are allowed and they have to do pcr test before departure to singapore and on arrival. after 3 and 7 days in singapore also need to do pcr tests at clinic.
to denmark don't need quarantine is true? what about back from denmark to singapore?
india when ?
2085
"i am poor no money to travel, how?"
"make a wooden boat, and sail."
work more harder to earn more money then can travel.
"you need a job, not a jab"
work your ass off to get money lah
"then go to work lah! if you already have one, take another one loh!"
be ready to end up as bad or worse than india.
indonesia pls🥲
"from today onwards, anybody who plans to fly oversea for holiday, my advice to you is you better think twice! if i am not mistaken, ba has 4 pilots died after full shots and jet blue in usa has 5 pilots died due to blood clots after full vaccination long ago, up till today how many more i don't know, so before you on board the flight, make sure you check out whether the pilot had taken the full jabs, you better be prepared psychologically that the flight can drop down from the sky like a rock anytime if the pilot suddenly suffer from a stroke due to blood clots. this is a new normal, happy holiday!"
the fact that you created a burner acc just to support the irrelevant orange man invalidates you completely. no ones gona belief your crap about planes falling out of the sky my dear. each plane has 2 pilot and is driven mostly on autopilot. go back to worshipping that orange head of yours
yw l autopilot doesn't need man to watch or control? you idiot! the plane can fly by itself?
"ray id assume you live with patrick but yes, planes can fly themselve lol. mindblown? or have you discovered fire yet?"
no jab no quarantine no mask no fly ...i free in home even can drink beer!
denmark with 70% fully vacinated? is this even true?  is it not less than 58% vaccinated in denmark ? is it not denmark already abolished all corona measures and will be official coming october 1st? is it not denmark will go back to old normal with no mask no testing no discrimination to the vaxxed and unvax?  which news should we  believe in?  mainstream news or alternative news? as for me i already made my choice and believe it's the right one... ✌️
"honestly, i would trust denmark, because if carlsberg did vaccines, it's probably the best in the world."
wanna see more brown faces soon
taiwan has the riskiest vaccination blunder.
"i’m shock that our government is thinking about america at all. highest infectious in the world, their constant disobedience toward mask wearing."
united states of america *  america is a whole continent.
v m yes usa alone has highest infection. obviously daniel is referring to usa when he said america....
the government has their reason so let us not say anything about it yet.
we must remember that there are 5000 american companies here.they bring a lot of jobs here.  the owners and their members have to travel for business and personal matters. there should be no suprise.
"and their stupid republicans, trumps supporters, kkkk"
v m  who the f care about the world map lesson right now
freedom ftw. keep wearing your mask slave 😎
malaysia when?
"with the current infection rate + new government just formed, it will be 2042."
dant lanz 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣sampai tua laaa  malaysia kesian perkerja banyak nak pergi singapore tak dapat kebulor lah kalau tunggu kat malaysia
next year they change goverment
sam umobile next year change again??? 😄😄😄 like that must extend liaoz! lol
why germany when their covid19 is still so serious ❓
when is china? still not recognise sinovac? china is one of the best control in the whole world. not to forget china is also the highest in world's population.
strange that singapore consider american the china being the lowest infectious rate now. truly political at play . disappointing if it happen that they allow american to come in freely
who believe at china's numbers? at least not me.
what about spain? one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and cases going down every day...
"if see it as endemic, they should just reopen border to all. if not thats mean talk bird only"
when we know our government just wants money
"seal young i agree, this is an inevitable decision for spore. soon or later, they have to re-open their border."
staying at home and blame government didn't supply for your foods and goods is very bitter way to live.
then you don't want money is it?
put uae
"ok but be extra vigilant with high-risk travels from countries like us, india and brazil. preferably rule these places out entirely for another year or two."
thailand please. cant to eat all the delicious and cheap thai foods and see all their beautiful women lol
golden mile can do all that
daniel lim hiv not contagious like covid
"its time to reopen. changi must regain the crown from qatar. look at how the closure affects. planes need to start flying. airlines cannot continue to bleed especially the national carrier. covid is a normality. ifyoudie, its just times up. otherwiseyouwill survive."
yes i agree. nothing much we can do. at this rate all must be prepared to get covid and hope can survive. so many are calling for another lockdown but its not sustainable.
qatar hosting a world cup they allegedly bribed their way to win rights to. perfect timing to win airport of the year right before the world cup. get my point?
i have been to qatar airport ...honestly it doesn't live up to no 1 ..i still prefer changi airport
i agree. it’s a never ending story!
japan and taiwan!!
waiting for boarder open to india praying every day. hope singapore gov doing good control measures and at end of the year will go. slow and study.
"no, india is not under control. a big no."
ivy sims town boss no for me also. when our we get vaccinated and at least on safety precautions release batch by batch.
siao ah travel!
subaru mine wife
maybe taiwan?
"when both spore and twn relax the restrictions, it’ll be a gigantic explosion of tourist into twn, sporean will die die go twn, bec is near, no covid discrimination,affordable, night markets.lockup for too long already, must go at all cause and cost.ha ha “ta pow” some unreported and undetected variant home."
i wants to go taiwan . pls hv a vaccinated lane to taiwan .
taiwan has trouble for finding vaccine source thank to mainland china ccp.
"our cases are going up again, 180 today. what makeyouso sure other countries are assured n confident of our covid fight success? they may think we r a danger instead, a small island 700 sq km, 5.6 million population, people to people proximity is densely closed. n covid cases in the hundred, never mind 80% vaccinated. we may think we do well but other countries may think otherwise."
when people from other country ask us. we tell them we already standing on 80% fully vac so just open up already and stop giving us any excuse. muhahaha.
cannot wait to go canada to see my spouse
i allready 30days  in canada toronto 🇨🇦
roxxy roxxy good luck 2 u
"booked tickets, hopefully cases are kept in check and reopening doesn't get postponed. beautiful british columbia!. remember to get travel insurance that covers covid! ntuc income is a good choice."
cannot wait to go wuhan to visit my girlfriend. she called me earlier today and told me im going to be a father soon!  woots!
"joey tan so happy for you!!  bc has a huge surge in cases in the interior, just like us here.  have a great time in 🇨🇦🇨🇦"
was really hoping to see malaysia here but the amount of cases there are still not decreasing
malaysia in no1 worst country of covid19 cases. 1.6mil infected in a country of 33mil in total. that is even worse then us/india ratio.
"jeroen derks yeah, hopefully it will get better soon and the borders will open again"
jia en yeah i hope so too.
"you still believe in the vaccine, and the pandemic?"
plandemic is meant to promote the dangerous vexsin!!
i don’t know why you choose not to believe.
god's amazing grace  the logic is flawed.
"gpac wee did you do any research before you said that? obviously not right? you probably even believe in the bad sin marketing efficacy of 95% instead of its efficacy that is 0.7%, despite seeing so many bad sin people catching it. you probably believe anything when you are fearful. that is normal, i do too, but i started doing research."
"god's amazing grace forgive them, they are blinded by fear, and the need to blindly follow others. but third shot coming soon, see if they can think."
then what you believe in? got better solution?
"180 cases now 👍,  its up trend ...200 cases can be achieved by weekend.  till then 200 to 300 is the new norm."
des chan the experts had said that the number will go up 200...300...and even up to 500....coming these days... don't panic... it's normal... just lives your life as per normal....
singapore future its normal till medical support limit exceeded
there are many more still under shn and qo after pcr test even more infected to be added on.
wong kok kiong  i think this is the reality. the virus won't go away. so observe safety measures and live life normally. get vaccinated is important
life goes on.. what is few hundred of cases where population is few million. even few thousand is nothing compare to millions. also it is not as if if they open up you will get infected. and infected doesnt mean sure death. everyday people die due to many other reason.. stop everything? impossible.
rs lin exactly.. the virus wont go away. just get vaccinated so if by any chance 1 get infected. it's just normal illness and likely to recover in 1 or 2 weeks. i work in the frontline and ive see so many positive cases and likewise people who recover. 1 only get very ill if they are not vaccinate or body is already very weak to begin with.
rs lin just released?
singaporepork another released?
germany just announced 4th wave n  &gt;11k infections in a day brunei has record 120 local infections n 11 clusters.  bring back more infections . more biz to close with more restrictions  geniuses  👍👏👏👏
vincecarlo thanks for sharing
erm ... how about back to lockdown ?  looking at the current trend.
lockdown would only happen when....
"pap in hard situation. if lockdown, people go mental ( e.g. river valley murder ). may not be for you, but there is a long impact on others. on the other hand, there is rising cases."
king they dont know wat they r doing
"sure!  good idea!  how big is your bank account???? do you have plentiful monetary funds to share with struggling singaporeans who will be in dire financial needs if our economy shuts down indefinitely?  if not, take time to grow a brain won’t you!"
king  low class comment. write something proper lah
bmpcos yah loh! this kind of people never think of other people. he think lock down means close the door and sleep all they long only.
james tay these people are not being reasonable.  we have to cooperate to overcome this and the govt must protect spore's long term interest. not an easy matter. and complaining and nagging are unhelpful
isn't it ok fully vexsinated already right?? can travel anywhere you like!! why still need so many tight measures??
🤣😂lucifer certainly lives in you!
c  i fully agree with your comment.
plzzz open border for pakistan
bhai mein last 4 month sy waiting pr hn. hope in september end.
salam bhai plzz whatsaap number send karain main 2 sall say wait krrha hu mujay apsay zarori baat krni hai
yar kab open huga ye kya maslaa hai
germany got 4th wave. bubble your head
bubbles already burst many times!! now it's called lanes
ha ha
one wave havent settle another wave coming
bring back for infections  more biz to close with so much restrictions
when open bangladesh
germany had yesterday 8500 new cases.
"if majority of their population have been vaccinated, those cases dosen't really matter."
"mexi yon 61 % at current. many infected are unvaxxed kids, but most of the come away with nothing much."
peter kroll 61%?? thats not really high/majority enough....but if they (germany) want to open whose to stop them as for the kids even if only one of them fall seriously ill or died due to covid-19 how your going to explain to their parents? just calling it a case of bad luck or misfortune?
germany is now having 4th wave
this rise coincides with the end of most european schools' 6-8 weeks of summer holidays. kids coming back for school and people going back to work from holidays.
"sun bird that's correct, and along with it more testing on return. anyways, the icu load is 1400 from about 30000 beds. 98.3 % of those needing serious support such as oxygen are unvax. that is what the singapore government aims at, too."
travel bubble to queensland australia soon i hope. have close family there that we haven't seen since early 2020.
my partner is waiting for me in perth. but wa will fight tooth and nail to keep borders closed -.-
brunei still close  they border because covid 19 still in they country...
germany just announced 4th wave n  &gt;11k in a day brunei has record 120 local infections n 11 clusters.  bring back more infections . more biz to close with more restrictions  geniuses  👍👏👏👏
"if singapore can consider usa, why not open for indonesia."
"in my opinion, although indonesia's case has been decreased these days, the number of testing is relatively low (indonesia: 117.069 tests/1m, usa: 1.753.221 tests/1m per 1st september 2021). this may indicate that there may be more covid case in indonesia than it should be, thus increasing the risk of re-opening. i am not an expert, but they may don't want to take a risk to open for country which has low testing level, since they may bring import covid cases to singapore. nevertheless, i hope the government can re-open the border asap when things are already well."
cases as in infected people!! so the numbers can increase or decrease as how it is reported!! most infected recover !!
the endemic fallacy/theory will be a very costly mistake. at least it did not cover 1 aspect – when the atmosphere thickened with viral loads. possible open cremation like india?
"pap in hard situation. if lockdown, people go mental ( e.g. river valley murder ). may not be for you, but there is a long impact on others. on the other hand, there is rising cases."
"the vaccinated pap ministers should all infect themselves with covit-19 and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said, then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory."
"don't worry, until last call for the 15% unvaccinated people is done.. and closed. all will open up and slowly no social distancing... no mask... this is how virus will attack everyone own time own target like having buffet. 🤣🤣🤣 this is similar to the real test on how noah's ark withstand the flood. when the virus flood the whole people in the country. those at higher risk of death or serious symptoms are: 1. unvaccinated - 70% 2. vaccinated people aged 65+- and above with serious medical problem 20% 3. vaccinated people aged 65+- and above with serious underlying problem. 10%. the final test will show how close it is to the percentage above... and the government claimed they won't bother will daily cases anymore but i doubt so they will abolish it since the public are curious to know. soon you will get what you wish for.. 😁 but you may get the consequence yourself too.👍good luck mate."
"allen chua by what you said, then, everyone can vote for change to protect their elderly who for valid reasons cannot be vaccinated. those who lost their loved ones can also join in. even those vaxed can also join in because forsaking is clearly unfit to be any leaders and cannot be accepted. my wish is for them to learn from ""others"" how to love their citizens and how to properly contain the virus for the life-safety of everyone."
"ttkoh123  don't be stubborn anymore... already proven this virus cannot be contained.  and proven lockdown is more damaging in long term. and already proven the 1 of the vaccines is very safe by fda already.  everyone need to go to school, to work, to earn a living, to go after their dream while they are alive.. no one want to be locked up forever. don't pretend to be noble caring about the seniors... you should go and find out from them.. seriously..  vaccinated or not... they rather go outside, meet up with friend to chat and risk death than to sit at home safely and like ""waiting for death"".  and how many of these elderly like you that cannot get vaccinated???? do you have the figure? offhand it is quite a low figure and no point for the rest of the country progress to be dragged down by them. now we probably have many kids that want to grow up to be a virologists or immunogists to save the world... they can only do so when it is all open up. these elderly can alway stay at home but most won't...and do all singaporeans want to accompany these small percentage of people to stay at home for like forever???"
allen chua singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher-risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives.
"allen chua lw also said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there will be leak from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “risk” because as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore?"
"allen chua mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew. every action is clearly benefitting the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives, for example, why must they keep importing from higher risk countries?  singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher-risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives."
"allen chua lw said on the 26 jul 2021 “we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time, but at that stage as you heard just now, our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated” [note the capitalized words]  mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug)."
"allen chua vaccination should never be used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. just the other day, on 17th aug, a 90-year-old ""fully vaccinated"" singaporean man up lorry from covid-19 complications; 6th in a month. just the other day, st reported that 2 ""fully vaccinated"" are in the icu. forsaking the life-safety of singaporeans will not be getting my vote."

"allen chua you should see his ""cocky"" face when he defended the imports. stop pretending and be accountable. compensate all business & household for their losses and then resign for the loss of innocent singaporean lives. talk more no use"
ttkoh123  against???? how many singaporeans willing to do hard labour and risky construction sites? how many singaporeans willing to collect all the garbage from block to block? and then who complain and request for compensation when bto delayed???? singaporean still want their bto and to some it is their dream.. government will handle the complain first.. because... singaporeans against ft and fw coming in is mainly a sweeping statement. no one nor the opposition mp has raise a formal objection against it simply because of the reasons above. you cannot based on youtube or fb comment to say they are against it and so what if they are against it?? have anyone raise a legal objection?
"allen chua how many singaporeans willing to serve army?. but they served nevertheless. so let others teach the miw how to run the country and stop them from finding excuses. time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news."
"allen chua hong kong's leader doubled down on her zero-covid strategy on tuesday, brushing off growing pushback from the business community over the city's indefinite international isolation. and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully."

"ttkoh123  don't be fool... no one is wiling to risk security to a new government.  lee kwan yew started this government and created a legacy to it.. and the only people that what to change this government is corrupted people...this i can assure you...  those that you heard complaining a lot about pap but still end up voting pap doesn't mean they are anti pap. some simply want new things..  compare this government to malaysia.. thailand.. indo, philippines.. you will be crazy to want to change it.."
"allen chua don't exhibit your stupidity and speak without basis. incidentally, i think chee soon juan, lim tean, kj and michelle lee are very promising. incidentally, despite so many incriminations and wild accusation thrown at the workers' party, they won the new sengkang grc in ge2020, and this is a fact. and the party is apparently running the town council very well despite wild claims that they are not able to manage."

"ttkoh123  mom resume entry from higher risk countries...  yes.. your wish right??? for the ministers to get infected, we need them to come and infect us.. 😂 anyway the point is.. even our kiasi ministers not kiasi about this... show that they got utmost confidence on the vaccine.. you can only say sour grape because you cannot be vaccinated."
"ttkoh123  as i had said.. most of our neighbours are dying to have a government like us.. except the corrupted people.. yes.. since day 1 to now.. still the same.. till the last election. if people want change, they don't have to wait for this pandemic to change and even more stupid to change an experienced and established government when the economy is at its most unstable...  now.. you talk like those exempted from ns.. 🤣🤣🤣 or doing 9-5 clerk work in ns. like i said the previous time.. if you are not happy.. just migrate lo... the fact is majority chosen pap.."
"allen chua you are clearly a liar. because you speak irresponsibly and carelessly, hence you have no credibility. substantiate with evidence the statement ""you cannot be vaccinated"" implying that you have evidence that i cannot be vaccinated."
allen chua  all patriots are to stay to vote for changes for the benefits of everyone and not just to benefit the rich and powerful or be fooled by the enterprise machineries. singapore belongs to everyone.
"allen chua time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news."
allen chua you speak with no basis whatsoever and exactly like an imbecilic kid. show evidence to support your silly opinions that no one sensible will believe anyway.
allen chua released barking here too?🙂
"allen chua like i said; don't exhibit your stupidity and speak without basis. incidentally, i think chee soon juan, lim tean, kj and michelle lee are very promising. incidentally, despite so many incriminations and wild accusation thrown at the workers' party, they won the new sengkang grc in ge2020, and this is a fact. and the party is apparently running the town council very well despite wild claims that they are not able to manage."
allen chua where are you from?
"ttkoh123 i agree about balancing up the parliament, but i find it distasteful that you are claiming that we are living miserably, as if there is any better way to tackle the pandemic. the issue at hand is all about maintaining the balance between the effects of the measures at hand. while we want to minimize the number of fts from high-risk countries, we also need to consider the impacts on the economy. you asked why the need to take in fts from high-risk countries, but do you have any suggestion on where to get the workers to tackle the daily mundane tasks aside from these high-risk countries?"
"forcexjr so,your suggesting to continue bring ft from high risk countries to ramp up infected cases?"
forcexjr where ryoufrom?
"forcexjr  hong kong's leader doubled down on her zero-covid strategy on tuesday, brushing off growing pushback from the business community over the city's indefinite international isolation. and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully. based on the ministerial statement by gky on the may 4th, 2020 as benchmark; ""numbers are important. we need to be assured that community transmission locally is stemmed, or very low,"" said mr gan in his ministerial statement. “community cases should ideally fall to zero or single-digits daily, with very low numbers of unlinked cases, not just for one day, but sustained over a period of time.""  and to make the matters worse, mom has the audacity to resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus will leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew.  yesterday 17th aug, 90-year-old fully vaccinated singaporean man up lorry from covid-19 complications; 6th in a month.  vaccination should never be used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. just the other day, on 17th aug, a 90-year-old ""fully vaccinated"" singaporean man up lorry from covid-19 complications; 6th in a month. just the other day, st reported that 2 ""fully vaccinated"" are in the icu. forsaking the life-safety of singaporeans will not be getting my vote."
"ttkoh123  you are exhibiting stupidity instead..  do you have 51% of singaporean adults agreed with you?  otherwise you are just chanting to the wall... like dr chee who never make it... never a mp..  don't be stupid again.. you said it... ""promising""  this world has a lot of promising people... the next michael jordan.. the next michael jackson, the next messi, the next cr7 who really make it in the end is what matters. what is even more stupid is you mentioned michelle lee who already quitted politic. so you expect singapore to be run by 3 people? why you bring up wp??? they are encouraging people to go for vaccination too.. they won because they got smart people and people can see.. unlikely your dr chee... maybe continue his cafe business.. lim tean and kj maybe just talk... no need action. as for your ivan lim... do you have proof they did not investigate.. they don't have to report every detail and daily activities to you. but what is more important? current situation or investigating some allegations that is not even 0.01% serious compared to najid razak's and that man is still outside the bar."
"forcexjr just today - 180 new cases of covid-19 infection in s’pore; 177 locally transmitted cases, 90 unlinked. the impacts and constant disruption, shops will be forced to go bankrupts, singaporeans are sufferings and living in miseries. 2 in 3 working singaporeans do not have savings to last them beyond 6 months: ocbc survey. poll results show nearly 50% of high-income earners in singapore face money issues [sjp asia survey]"
des chan   come scary cat... meow... 💉  you go and tell people where you are from first la.. better put your scary cat face too.. so we all can see.
"ttkoh123 wow.. why you keep cut and paste comment? the 90yo up lorry part was used much earlier... are you a bot? that is why all go for vaccination all will be safe. like the army said all for 1, 1 or all.. oh ya.. i forget you ah gua bing.. didn't do army... and got health problem cannot be vaccinated. fda approved pfizer already.. so very safe.. and jab and jab and jab... if you are 16yo and above"
allen chua so where ryoufrom?
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility? as i said you are a liar. at the very least, you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser. don't expect me to reply to a liar."
"des chan you say ""meow meow"" first then i tell you.."
allen chuajust another freeloader that ditched yr country !!!
allen chua keep barking
"ttkoh123 erm i did not ask for any of this statistics. i’m just curious that, since you suggested that we do not import our foreign workers (etc. construction workers/cleaners) from high-risk countries, where should we get them from?"
"des chan it should not be hard to infer where i’m from based on what i’ve written in the comment. in fact, i’m surprised that you actually asked."
"forcexjr simple question, simple answer"
"lsl will the first to die if expose, he is so frail. even triple dose also not enough. covid wind is super strong, even with vaccination super storm barrier, the wind chill alone can kill him."
"forcexjr in a time like these, stop all unnecessary construction except the absolute essential life-critical ones. priority on the life-safety of singaporeans and employ strategy as active waiting until a proven solution is found."
"forcexjr your insistence to ask silly questions like fws sources clearly showed your warped priorities over the life-safety of your own fellow singaporeans, especially when there is no answer for the variants. when you break your leg, you wait for it to heal. when there is a hurricane, you wait out in safety. also read strategy as active waiting. when you have no answer, you wait till you have a definite answer, particularly when people's lives are of concern. and when there are desperate needs of workers, mobilize the national service personnel in such times of emergencies. how many singaporeans are willing to serve army?. but they served nevertheless. therefore its a matter of policies. as i said; hong kong's leader doubled down on her zero-covid strategy on tuesday, brushing off growing pushback from the business community over the city's indefinite international isolation. and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully."
"des chan  ohhhh scary cat look for adoptive home??? asking where people from? say ""meow meow"" la.. i tell you 💉"
linkongda lee family where got so easily die... all at least reach 90 lo.. you die he also haven't die.
"ttkoh123 nz has 721 active covid cases as of today, despite tough border closures and lockdowns. what worked last year may not work so well this year with the highly transmissible delta variant. arden is being urged to reconsider her zero case strategy. they may have no choice if they cannot get back to zero cases."
ttkoh123 already stop unnecessary construction for 1.5 years until construction companies bankrupt. you want to stop until when????? maybe it is your 38.76% that complain about hdb delayed... and more youngsters want to have their own house and don't want to live with nagging and unreasonable parents (like you). ya la.. essential as well you think blanga on consignment..can bring in just 1 or 2 to clear rubbish only.?
"anchored check your typo. compare this with 180 new cases of covid-19 infection in s’pore; 177 locally transmitted cases, 90 unlinked."
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility? as i said you are a liar. at the very least, you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser. don't expect me to reply to a liar."
"anchored exactly.. even brunei cannot stop it either.... already proven cannot control.. so just get vaccinated. this fellow probably sleep with dr chee every night.. he think run country like running cafe. lol anyway this guy got health problem.. doctor don't want give him assurance he can take these vaccine. so he ownself do not dare take vaccine... with upcoming restriction for unvaccinate people, he want to change government.. and want those small parties people to run singapore....crazy (because wp also urge all to get vaccinated)"
ttkoh123 heard that nz also burst.. so whole world everyday change government la😂😂😂 like malaysia
"des chan looks like hdbs, btos and construction and returning to normal lives can only be safely resumed after 2025 and only when the parliament is balanced up. time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system, for example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news."
"ttkoh123 resuming work in 2025? are you a prophet? what makes you so sure that the pandemic would be over by then? i'm no construction expert, but i'm quite sure that any incomplete building would fall to ruins if left unattended for a few years. i see that you keep bringing hk and nz into the picture, so did they halt every single work that's taken on by foreign workers then? by the way, if the government mobilizes ns personnel to cover the works, please be the first one in line to volunteer. after all, since you are the one who suggested this, you must be eager to take on this role. we can have you stand under the hot sun and weld steel beams together, how about that? to be honest, i don't really like the idea of taking in foreign workers from high-risk areas, but we don't have a damn choice. many of our work sectors rely on them after all. i'm just mad with how the government allowed families of those workers to come into our country when there isn't a need to in the first place. in my opinion, that truly escalated the risk of the virus spreading, and is itself a bad decision when our country had recovered so well several months ago."
allen chua keep barking
des chan he must be from china.instant singaporean
hakuna matata  and you?  from the pond?
bmpcos 🤣🤣🤣chinamen angry.meow
des chan 💉💉💉 meowwwwwwwwww🙀
"forcexjr i did not say the pandemic would be over by 2025. i said the construction works would ""likely"" be ""safely"" resumed after 2025. please read carefully and not jump to a conclusion. and you did agree to balance up the parliament, which implies that you agreed we need all the real capable and talented people to lead us out of these miseries. hence, the logical and sensible estimation will be in 2025 and only when the parliament is balanced up. substantiation: the virus was knowingly brought in. lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there will be leak from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore. also, since you are no construction expert, then why is there a need to say things that you don't know? so i will completely ignore those since you have no basis of substantiation.  apparently, your priority is not on singaporean life-safety. as i have said, in a time like these, stop all unnecessary construction except the absolutely essential life-critical ones. priority on the life-safety of singaporeans and employ strategy as active waiting until a proven solution is found. singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher-risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives. looks like hdbs, btos and construction and returning to normal lives can only be safely resumed after 2025 and only when the parliament is balanced up. time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system, for example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news."
ttkoh123 no need 2025.. next year 2022 can resume..  antivaxxers just be careful.. stay safe.. stay at home. let the vaccinated risk the storm outside. 🤣
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility? as i said you are a liar. at the very least, you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser. don't expect me to reply to a liar. so you agreed that you are a liar since you are not able to provide evident to support your falsehoods as demanded."
ttkoh123 a liar calling me a liar.. you lie the most here... everyone know how pathetic you are..  simply...you want small parties with totally no experience in governing a country to govern singapore when current government is dreamy bt the neighbours. this is more like a lab test that will go wrong.  at least if you suggest wp.. i can still give you the benefit of doubts.. but wp is pro vaccine so you also shun them.. this show the selfish side of you. you want what evidence? i don't see you have any evidence either except using quotes from other.. and it is getting outdated day by day look around you 80%+++ vaccinated.. 4 million plus and you bite on 3 people with death and serious condition.  if i have heart problem and headache.. painkiller can also kill me.. anyway.. you cannot change anything.. 4 years later still pap 9 year later the same..  maybe you should go dr chee's cafe for some adrenaline.. oh wait.. you can't.. not vaccinated. 🤣
"ttkoh123 it’s clear that you do not have the answers to my question. i asked you where to get our foreign workers, and what is your response? you said i do not prioritise the safety of our countrymen. what kind of answer is that? you also insisted that we halt construction works because of the pandemic, so shouldn’t the construction works return only after the pandemic is over, and in your assumption, 2025? this is why a total ban on foreign workers is not possible. if the global pandemic is not over by 2025, what makes you think a balanced parliament could do any better than the current parliament set-up? what should they do then? continue banning the foreign workers? until when? until the next, next election? this is why i keep emphasising on alternate options on securing foreign workers: if you want to ban workers from high-risk areas, you better have back-up options. also, be careful about playing the “countrymen”  card, because i’m sure many of us, especially ns men, would point our fingers at you for suggesting to cover up the works that the foreign workers left behind."
"forcexjri don't need to answer your silly questions because they are unimportant and singaporeans themselves can easily distrust it. st readers/singaporeans are mostly educated. as long as they read and become aware then, i considered myself to have achieved regardless of how you think or how you want to maneuver their minds away from the truths. apparently, your priority is not on singaporean life-safety. as i have said, in a time like these, stop all unnecessary construction except the absolutely essential life-critical ones. priority on the life-safety of singaporeans and employ strategy as active waiting until a proven solution is found. singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher-risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives.  looks like hdbs, btos and construction and returning to normal lives can only be safely resumed after 2025 and only when the parliament is balanced up. time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system, for example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news."
"ttkoh123 this also a call to all st readers/singaporeans. ask yourself these few questions: 1) are you willing to postpone your bto or other housing plans to beyond 2025? 2) do you think there is any better solution to all these problems ever since the pandemic started? 3) do you think that the measures that other countries employ to combat the pandemic successfully can all be implemented in our country? to all ns personnel: 3) are you willing to pick up the slack that foreign workers left behind, in addition to tending to your current duties? take note that this may include resuming construction works and maintaining the infrastructures throughout our country. also, since that person refused to answer my question, can anyone tell me: 4) is there any alternative to where we could source our foreign workers? any ""low-risk"" country where its people are willing to do these jobs in our country? any at all?"
"forcexjr don't even be enticed or be lured into a ""desire"" intentionally hiding out the truths from you. the truth is the virus was knowingly leaked into the communities. without a solution for the delta or the mu variants, and baiting on human desires as excuses to benefit the rich and powerful and their cronies companies while singaporeans are suffering in miseries and some loss of their loved ones. as we recall;  lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there would be leaks from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore."
"forcexjr lw said on the 26 jul 2021 “we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time, but at that stage as you heard just now, our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated” [note the capitalized words]  mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug)."
"forcexjr apparently, if you look around, machineries have been mobilized to ""maneuver"" the thinking into ignoring the rising infection numbers and to mislead c19 as the ""flu"" so as to coerce them to live normally to churn the economy for others. by contrast with the statement that the “community cases should ideally fall to zero or single-digits daily, with very low numbers of unlinked cases, not just for one day, but sustained over a period of time."" as said before, i would say it's foolhardy to gamble on the ""endemic theory""."
forcexjr singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher-risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives.
"forcexjr time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead us out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example, no sign of investigations by pap into the allegations of ivan lim, 1 year since pm lee’s promise to do so as read in the toc news. ""balance up"" for the benefits of all singaporeans. lower gst, lower housing cost, lower cost of living, jobs abundance and securities, no endemic risking and flip-flops and real caring for the life-safety of all singaporeans etc."
"allen chua i'm pro vaccine, and i'm still taking all the measures needed to avoid contracting covid."
"cw8 that's good.. in fact our culture are more conservative than the western who already mask off after they are fully vaccinated. i just wear mask and social distancing. those double masks and face shield, keep washing hands for 20sec... too torturing for me.. take note that soon most of us won't really know they had contracting covid or not as our symptoms are less and mild.."
"ttkoh123  you are the one that want to risk the lives of singaporeans with small parties of your so called unproven talents to govern... later bto collapsed in few years, malaysia don't sell us water... all snatch new water.. 😂😂"
very few incoming travellers will be prepared to undergo 4 expensive pcr tests and then a risk of being locked up if one of these is positive. if covid is now endemic and we are protected by vaccines there is no logic to inbound testing. germany for example does not require inbound testing for vaccinated travellers.
we are opening step by step. this is the way to go.  cannot rush and end up with too many cases and overwhelm our health resources. we have to work hand in hand with our govt
"it looks as if the st is too ashamed to report 161 new cases of covid-19 infection in s’pore; 156 locally transmitted cases, 79 unlinked? what's up?"
ttkoh123  media manipulative reporting!!
"ttkoh123  as of 1 september 2021, 12pm, the ministry of health (moh) has preliminarily confirmed 177 new cases of locally transmitted covid-19 infection.   2.     54 are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 33 are linked to previous cases and were detected through surveillance. 90 are currently unlinked. amongst the cases is 1 senior above 70 years who is unvaccinated, and is at risk of serious illness.  3.     in addition, there are 3 imported cases, who have already been placed on stay-home notice (shn) or isolated upon arrival in singapore. all of them developed the illness during shn or isolation.   4.     in total, there are 180 new cases of covid-19 infection in singapore today.  5.     we are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the moh press release that will be issued tonight."
germany just announced 4th wave n  &gt;11k in a day brunei has record 120 local infections n 11 clusters.  bring back more infections . more biz to close with more restrictions. more suffering n job losses geniuses  👍👏👏👏
when china open it’s border for international students like singapore?
"i believe singapore haven't really 'opened' the border for international student. there are lots of my peers from universities who cannot come to singapore (even the class has started since august) from various countries. i hope they will at least   loosen the border for international student. they don't know when they will come, and it stresses them all."
i just want to go sentosa jb…. will do

open india borders pls
i am desperately waiting for visiting singapore.
fot what you dieing to visit singapapore
sam umobile usually i like to travel. my last singapore trip was in 2019 . at that time i was amazed to see the marina bay sands . moreover the people of singapore are so friendly. the most important reason is shopping. so as a tourist i am waiting when will singapore lift its restrictions for tourists. do you like travelling to singapore??
sami islam im singaporean
yes preciselly travelling is singapores pastime we can travell to germany now im looking at berlin ill hope the world is better for all thus you are wellcome
sam umobile thanks brother. i like singapore because in singapore everywhere i see discipline and i love the skyscraper in orchard road. so i hope you will able to travel berlin as soon as possible.
when burunei reopen their borders 😢
wat abt india. ders no list or any info abt india
since i'm fully vaccinated i need to travel to india too need visa been waiting for long. .kindly open malaysia too only for those vaccinated not vaccinated not thanks
"you needs to travel to india, what  got to do with malaysia opening up or not?"
you is required to get vaccinated to makan at restaurants but covid is scared to be inside fully crowded buses even if you is not vaccinated. also some little kids are immune too!
india to singapore
when will reopen  in singapore from  indian's
social  distancing mean taking transport to work in crowded trains and buses. the push to re-open offices is a death trap. allowing vistor is really not the time now.
hopefully soon travellers from india will be considered. please do it. my family is separated for almost a year.
"better for you to go back to india and pay them s short visit, then come back. don't bring in more covid 19 cases."
whether your vaccinated or unvaccinated you can't guarantee that coronavirus will eat you are not..
come on turkey!
"pfizer has not finished the final phase 3 trials for the vaccination. it is only slated to end on 27 jan 2023. as such, the vaccine currently administered is an experimental one. any person who chooses to take this vaccination is involuntarily subjected as an experimental subject for a trial that i do not consent to partaking.  given the forgoing medical and moral risks, if there is any administration (or attempt) of any covid-19 vaccine to my child, intentionally or accidentally without my written or expressed permission, please take note that i reserve all rights to take legal action against the relevant parties.   bear this in mind, pap"
"so are singaporeans free of shn when they travel to those open-lane countries, and later back to singapore?"
this is how the virus spreads.
<b>when india can get vaccinated travel lane cos i want to holiday there?</b>
expats are not equal foreigners are angry the one day close open lanes. it shows bad planning . they are leaving. the quality expats. so what foreigners are you bringing. low skill jobs . white blue colour beat singaporeans work jobs . so what you get in fact is no longer talented expats but low end quality then singapore become a third world status cause by influx . the well being of singaporeans is not taken seriously!
new variants coming from asian country. myammar is one. general ming doesn’t tell you they are having huge outbreak. people creating diy vaccine and having lung damage. no doctors rate oxygen. so you should question 50millons spread does it give you delta / delta plus / delta singapore?
"brunei is reporting about 200 cases daily, and over 300 today in a tiny nation of only about 433k people. also, it has extremely low vaccination rates ( singapore sending 100k of moderna to them) and very poor epidemiological/epidemic controls. it doesn't meet all the criteria that  ong ek said the task force looks at for border reopening to a foreign country. why is singapore allowing vaccinated but quarantine free travel from brunei? this is very high risk. also new zealand is now experiencing an outbreak that will soon surge and we allow them to enter, unvaccinated and no quarantine and only 1 incoming test? same for taiwan, which i don't trust their government with their infection numbers and has extremely low vacination rate. singapore covid19 task force is putting singapore to unnecessary risk."
all should be tested regularly regardless of open lane.
please add amsterdam 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
fine
what?
"if you do not open the border to china, there will be no china virus. prcs are effective carriers of the virus."
opening of the tourism in a selected country is a good idea for the economy of singapore
going to overseas now do holidays not a good idea.. world still in pandemic whether vaccinated or not vaccinated
hmm
hope the australian government learns from this . here sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.
"awesome singapore, but what about unvacinate people but healthy"
areyouserious? there are twenty over ppl who are fully vaccinated and get infected with covid. now they are using ventilators to breathe in the hospital...
what about student pass for indians
apply again when next year if covid under control.
"if they can trust those european,  why can't they let those unvaccinated people of 2 to dine in restaurant.  those unvaccinated  people are also healthy  and not infected.  why can't they dine in ? since almost 80% vaccinated. i just couldn't understand  the logic ."
"getting people to be vaccinated is all part of thier plan, mouth say worry for you but truth in fact is they need those vaccinated numbers in order to negotiate deals with other country to open border. so for those that got vacc and believe gov cares foryougoodluck."
"germany  have 9 bordering countries, european  they are borders free . can we trust them they declear  ? hope they can at at least put them in hotel 3 days even the test pass."
"i believe reopening border is too early as we do not have sufficient data to guarantee a safe reopening of the border knowing very well what is happening all over our regions.  it would be very unwise.  lives are at stake.  maybe test on reopening in singapore more fully before reopening border because of economy alone.  i do understand the importance of singapore economy,  but this is what the government must be prepare to shelter from.  lives are at stake.  remember the vaccines were developed in a rush and is only approved for emergency used by fda and the future effects are unknown."
i like how unvaccinated people in the country itself is more dangerous than those coming in from outside the country. segregate unvacc people but allow people from outside borders to come in
that's muppet logic for 4
suicide attempt!
"in two months they will start shutting down again. guaranteed. just wait for it. the vaccines don’t stop the spread and masks only slow it a bit. new shots will be needed, so rinse and repeat."
now 111 cases liao
belgium is a very racist country
"please update the covid-19 travel restrictions or rules on the website of ministry of foreign affairs. make things easier for foreign travellers. don't be lazy - don't refers everything to moh website. moh information is for residents living or staying in singapore. mfa's job is to serve foreigners. hence, the description and language used may not be the same."
"soon, singaporeans will be unwelcome! just bring on the variants! all our 1.9 years of effort down the drain! in the animal kingdom, only the smartest and strongest can lead the pack for survival!"
sure! bring them on!  there goes all our efforts!
the travelling l think  go next year better 😃👍
germany is a nice country but very far and pricey. i'm waiting for japan & korea to open up for travel. am sure many singaporeans are waiting for 🇯🇵🇰🇷
i miss singapore too lah cant wait to travel back🥲
"have to wait for a long time, seriously."
it’s not that nice country only in the cities where are people of colour. the west is a racist place. i would never leave singapore or any place  to live in a racist country
belgium is the worst racist country
looking forward to traveling again but not too soon
"then dont travel, stay in your turtle shell"
this is what i call playing against the house with the odds against you.
😅😅
so who did you vote for?
"qaz wsx not for the current board of directors, that's for sure. best prepare for when they roll the dice, and we are made to pay the tab."
pap is irrelevant.
james lim  pp is passé outdated
"btw, when is the 5 per table in coffee shop and hawker center going to happen?"
you miss aunties and uncles
rubarani v it's a legit question. it was part of the plan. no need to be sarcastic.
"just say it's about money la, so many bull crap excuses. living with covid is singapore being normal with no mask wearing and public gathering first, not opening borders to more variants."
ya lor idk that dine in 2 pax max and unvacc cant go gym / aircon fnb and many more other activities are still waiting to open up is the normal lmao. inside country lives not even fixed yet for residents now want open borders... smh
"go back hk/macau still need quarantine 14 days, who wants to come? ownself declare ownself safe when their government press release already stated they are not going to talk about the travel bubble with singapore at all at the current stage."
yes
"formula for covid-1984: new variant -; more cases -; lockdown + further restrictions -; vaccinations - and the whole cycle repeats itself. draw this cycle on paper and you'll see the picture, if you're not a sheeple."
omg a lion thank you for your bravery
"broyoumissed out the part where after vaccinations they set rules to segregate those who had the ""choice"" to not get vaxx but end up kena thier stupid unvaxx / vaxx restrictions"
it take guts to open and go back to normal living👍👍. dont let fear rule us..👏👏👏
"just come up with a good self test, even better then the one we already have. don’t force people to take vaccin or segregate the unvaxxed. especially when we have no idea how long the juice will last. very very scary this segregation and control when it’s not that serious if you not very old with underlying disease."
hahaha only now singapore? i thoughtyouwere soo damn rich not to open your borders? why scared now? 🥱😛
"haha this is for the benefit of the government and it’s private company, we try to persuade our neighbors and friend to get vaccinated thinking that our government will treat this covid as a endemic, so that we have little or no restrictions but instead there is no change in restriction, they wanted to lift some travel restriction for their personal benefit, all the hawker center will continue to suffer poor business, what a joke, this is how we are fool by this bunch of heartless idiot."
well done singapore.its logic to let pandemic become endemic
with delta variant.. it will take a really long while for businesses to recover. maybe will never recover.
lol open up for saf training
unfortunately gemany just now gets into a 4. wave ... as announced by the renowned robert koch institute.
than we close again.... again.
so who did you vote for?
i was thinking should i come to singapore? but now im happy that i haven't decided yet
"better not, until both have 0 cases...stay safe!"
we are happy too
where are you from?
james tay i’m from florida
so basically similar things will be happening to australia in december when the country will reach the 80 percent vaccination rate. it will probably also establish 4 classes of countries to travel to and from australia. by december singapore-australia two-way travel will be probably very likely with 7 day quarantine at accommodation of people's choice. only vaccinated travellers can get into and out of australia.
australia never reach 80% rate
s11 y3
"if you can remove boarder restrictions then let us remove masks and local restrictions. 80% fully vaccinated already, we have jumped all through your hoops, allow us to live normally again."
couldn't agree any better😑
"looking at u.s and u.k,.. the people had the choice to take down their mask, then see what happened after that. be patient."
"james tay far as i can see, they have been given a choice to not wear one, but still do when in large crowds. we have 77% fully vaccinated so that’s more than enough to at least not wear one whilst walking around outside? i would wear one on public transport,  but not outside."
uncaged 86 it's 102 degree in ohio. i will not wear a mask outside. 😤
government open travel in desperation of money  citizen of singapore do nothing and gains nothing but are exposed to the potential of delta variant wide spread
now they change it to lane travel. no more bubbles wrapping made in china 😂😂😂 i guess they are hoping for a smoother landing.  only if we can manage our own community cases with all those unlinked cases.  let try this lane initiative.
ya lo 🤔
what about faranworkers ...transfer new rules  cna plz update hello
china need to ban singapore as they allow eu come in
singapore dont depend on china
rubarani v really?  afghanistan want  eat my lunch.
we are helping to take care of 3 of pooh's family member here inn singapore zoo. you can have them back if you want.
i look forward to travel bubbles but..can we just sort things out first at home? it feels we are again rushing into something that will only reignite another lockdown later on.
i have the same feeling...
not bubble…it is lane far smoother less trouble
olympic 2022 aftermath... and here we are... lets mix and match...  looks like the delusional indian politician will have the last laugh at this rate...  well aleast we are trying.... to move forward
good! more lockdown stay home no need work
"good decision  sir , spore economy can't only depends on sporean..pls faster further ease of other country."
yes. build more mortuaries and icus. let's welcome all visitors.
if we assume all foreigners here are vaccinated (big assumption)....and foreigners are 30pc of the population...then does that mean that 1.2m locals (or 30pc) of locals are unvaccinated?
what about malaysia?
"malaysia 23,000 new covid cases yesterday. what do you think?"
hell no…it will never happen for now 😅 sorry 😣
why you asked that for? obviously now is not the time
"omg g making mistakes again on border control. in order to control the spread in endemic mode we still need to try to keep our case numbers low esp from overseas imports. so the inital shn is still vital, all passengers on arrival need to under go the rapid test (15min results). if negative shn for 3 days followed by another test before release to the public as passengers could pick up the virus on the plane or their airports etc. vax pax who test +ve are still contagious ... please don't get mistaken that vax gives total immunity it only provides mainly protection, shn from foreign country is still essential. giving no shn is a fundamental mistake, to the hard work singapore has put in. vac should be our safety net ... not a main net. border crossing via cause way, may have come in without shn if they are regular vaxed workers daily commute but must be tested upon immediate entry. non work pass holders ie visitors need shn for 3 days + testing before release. remember going endemic mode does not mean we remove the care to keep case numbers low and we should continue testing of cases like now, but most/all of our business can open."
this is about sia not country or people.  the shareholders need to be kept happy.
8
positive move. we can't close borders forever
we have never truly closed the borders… that is the kicker which many don’t understand thus the many clusters in the community to date.  so i suggest you get with the program.  this open lane travel is to rescue the dying iconic sia n their shareholders stakes in the airline.  thus the vaccine passport between eu n singapore.  funny yet china hk macau are welcome with no quarantine or vaccine status.  these double standard approach will see us having more issue in the next few months.  nz rejects the travel lane till 2022. they just cannot take the risk opening up to singapore.
🤣🤣🤣 sounds familiar
no more bubble trouble travel.  now it is travel clear lane… yet our own community cases are in the 3 digit numbers daily infection plus increasing numbers of unlinked cases.  best of luck 🤞  can’t open the community but can to eu n brunei.
"its time for another good idea, bad idea... good idea - opening borders to increase tourism and improve the local economy. bad idea - opening borders and increase risk of imported cases. are we that desperate for tourism business?"
it is to for sia survival…that’s the plan.
"not just sia, but also for changi airport, garden by the bay, sentosa, hotels, restaurants,etc."

"actually, yes."
you can take 10 pcr test but who is perfectly fine from any part of world please allow them. why total ban ? if they are vaccinated months before. covid don't travel from people to people it can travel any way from air from any shipment from even airoplanes. so why people suffer from travelling your beautiful country ? fully vaccinated people allow them & give them more vaccine in ur country ifyouwant. we can't hide from covid but we can fight from it.
"good to open up the borders but calibrated, airlines need to work to help the economy all over the world."
"with delta virus, no thanks"
its not fare if we cant travel ?? totally not fare
life is not fair. suck it up.
"and how bout singaporean those has taken thier vaccination,can we go for travel? and meet up ,reunite with our wife and kid???????"
"dont ask singapore, ask the destination country."
go then... don't come back.
"reopen inside singapore first, then open for others."
reopen inside singapore like travel from jurong to bedok is it?
"boba fett not really. more like travel to state court to be sued by pinky lee to line up his coffer, to help his income match that of his 'wife'"
praying every day have to open the boarders for india.

all vaccines are recognised but only mrna available on national program. muppet logic
batam reopen🤔🤔🤔
i'm thinking when indonesia is gonna re-open? cause a lot of countries have the 80% vaccination rate of their adult population to reopen. indonesia won't be open for long? why can't they vaccinate its citizens faster?
"just open to batam first, 73% already vaccinated 1st dose, 20+% vaccinated 2nd dose, new cases below 50 a day 😩 come onnn!!"
adel must be at least 80 % fully vaccinated (i.e. both doses).
stan k yeah but singapore is opening up to other countries that are not 80% fully vaccinated right now..? like in this news
"​adel for a country to be able to open to other countries, it must have 70% - 80% of its adults population fully vaccinated. singapore will say welcome to the people currently in australia next month but australia will still be closed because next month, around this time, australia will probably have only about 40% of its adults population fully vaccinated. australia will be 80% fully vaccinated by early december. so i think it will be opened by mid-december but it also depends on whether other countries already allow their citizens to travel to australia. for indonesia, a lot of countries categorise indonesia as a high risk country in terms of vaccination rates, vaccination reliability and accuracy, and the measures they do in indonesia to prevent infection (such as restrictions, face masks, etc). there are low risk, medium risk, high risk, and no-travel countries. i think indonesia, unfortunately, will be in the 'high risk countries' categories which is disappointing because i want to travel to jakarta, etc, too. it is almost impossible to open only select areas in indonesia like bali and batam cause usually when a country opens, it opens the whole parts of the country."
if singapore 80% vaccinated... singapore can help our neighbours country... malaysia johor... indonesia batam.. can very the can can open the border🤔🤔🤔
"​azman selamat a country will be open to other countries of their choice if it is 70%-80% adults vaccinated. but if the other countries still don't allow the people there to travel to that country which is open to them, then there is no points. singapore will be opened to the people in australia by mid september and australia will be opened to the people in singapore by mid-december. so in this case, the people in both countries can travel to each other's countries by mid-december. this concept is known as 'travel bubbles'. i don't think indonesia, malaysia, most of sea countries will allow the people currently in sea to travel overseas except singapore and brunei. east asian countries have much better prospects than se asian countries in terms of opening of their countries. so maybe japan, south korea, taiwan, sar hong kong will be opened by the end of the year. but for se asia, no. i wished i could travel to se asia by december but i think the only countries i can travel to in sea by december will probably be singapore and brunei."
"azman selamat you need to refer back to category 4 , they stated the countries that they banned - pakistan , india ,nepal, bangladesh, sri lanka , myammar - not malaysia or indonesia , but still need to wait and not rush.. for both indonesia and malaysia ."
azman selamat . have to wait unit we produce vaccine here. then can we decide who to sell those vaccine to..
why not the uk. we are close to 80% fully vaccinated.
cos uk is sh*t
because number 1 didn’t uk suddenly had a delta variant surge and number two were trying to not to end up in another lockdown
anon nymouz how is it when everything is open like normal. if you want to know what s*** is then look at new zealand & austraila.
dannyisnow100 the whole globe almost has the delta strain now. over time new strains will come. the uk death rate is low now conpared to the 1st wave. life is normal here now. they is no social distancing measures here. they uk realise that lockdowns don't work.
"mike's travel show well yes but the uk still has way too many cases. sure they are vaccinated, but they are carriers, and with the delta surge in the uk, the chances of imported cases is much higher."
mike's travel show  if lockdowns don’t works and vaccines don’t work i guess this how life ends
anon nymouz . ceca worst than ....
"hoping to salvage their stock portfolio.  10 yr libor is poised to explode, the global money cartel is sick of fed res lies for so long.  that’s why stocks are crashing."
"such irresponsible government.  using people as stakes in gamble.  economy goes up down all the time.  death is endgame.  singapore will be shunned world wide, irrational policies create dangerous situations."
"if you think government is not good ,by all means go and migrate 😈you need not have to criticize until like that 👿"
you don’t speak for all singaporeans and the millions of livelihoods on the line.
"government cannot appease everyone. when the local vaccination rate is reasonably high, it is worthwhile to take the risk to reopen the border and do business. so many sectors are dying…"
品味历史品味人生 i hope a higher official in thailand think like you. we have to move on from covid19.
fanny choo you're a silly fool . you don't know anything
🙏🙏🙏
"80,000 vaccinations daily means in the next 15 days we can get another 1,200,000 vaccinated. and hence only the 500,000 below 12year old are not vaccinated.....by then singapore will have 90% fully vaccinated.!!"
antibodies that exist in the body for approximately 2-10 months depending on the immune system of the vaccinated individual… plus antibodies will take 4weeks after vaccination to develop.  a bit more science less maths.  this is not a number game.
"shiela tee eh hallo auntie, he only try to be optimistic lah not sour graping"
farjiel 888  just go away… salty uncle!
shiela tee lolol sore loser aunt
farjiel 888  go finish your schooling first before trying to analyse data!
jumping the gun to open prematurely to expect positive result/outcome is wishful thought.   it will not work
only way to find out with empirical data is to try. otherwise it’s just opinions and hearsay.
mikeis this a good calculated risk?
salmon nella yes.
rush to open up is unwise n stupid
let’s see the effects of blood clots at high altitude
is there a doctor on board ?
such a stupid comment

"remember to get vaccinated or a vaccinated person might get sick from the virus they got vaccinated against because you're not vaccinated.  make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they believe it.🤣  a lie told once remains a lie but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.  if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.  volunteering in a global gene therapy experiment funded by a eugenicist is a bad idea.  change my mind   🤣"
"living with covid means it should start in singapore. not a damn travel bubble. un-restrict parks/public gatherings, team sports first. that's living with covid.  letting people of all ages hang out with their mates, visiting their families freely. attend festivities. that's living with covid. it shouldn't start with a travel bubble."
exactly
that's muppet logic for u

oktoberfest!!!!
get prepared to get poke 5x for a round trip. i read that on sia website
it's cancelled in 2021 btw
wasn't oktoberfest canceled back in may ?
vincecarlo damnnn wasn't aware haha
t x   fret not even president of travel agent unawares  wonder how he does his job 🤭🤭
"thank goodness germany had the sense to cancel it. why would a sensible,  responsible singaporerean want to attend the oktoberfest where there are literally thousands of people crowded together when corona is still rampant in germany? i implore singaporereans not to be too ' happy go lucky' if they decide to vacation in germany, and bring the virus back to singapore. keep wearing your masks, avoid crowded places, especially indoors and behave responsibly in view of pandemic."

interesting.... how wil ica know if any eu passport has been in germany 21days before depart to singapore?...... mtf mil$ math!
stamp.
"traveller man no stamp when crossing eu borders bro, and you call yourself ''traveller man"""
there is no stamp of that because in the eu they go from country to country and don’t need stamp
"i agreed, even the tourist stay 21 + days in germany, it doesn’t guarantee that he/she is free from wu han virus or it’s variant. please rethink the policy carefully. if spread happen again, pap may lost next election…"
"td now i already very unhappy how pap/mtf is handling the covid and believe many others too, if only more people are sober and already voted out pap at the 2020 elections... sigh"
"ora sass  i think pap lost another grc in last election should serve as a warning to pap. especially, one of their so call candidate, turn out to be a crook. luckily, the news broke before they field him in election. they need to look into process to select election candidate.        on the other side, opposition party need to improve their overall candidate quality.  a good candidate can stand a better chance in election. but most of them, can not make it."
td now very true
traveller man . no needs to chop stamp for europeans moving within eu.

"the jury is still out about the full picture of covid-19 and the vaccines. experts differ in their analysis and are still debating it. look at all the flip flops coming out. do not ever hastily mandate or force vaccination until a clear picture emerge. imagine how hellish it would be injecting the vaccine into the mentally unprepared.  the big unanswered question is why the laxity on our trains and buses. clear cut glaring double standards. it will be an unforgivable sin, inhumane, careless, a huge mistake if vaccination is made compulsory. the enforcers will be troubled by their conscience till their dying day if their decision is insincere and proved inaccurate later.  there is no solid understandable data yet to justify enforce compulsory vaccination.  other treatments could be on the way. but big pharmas’ bottom line and stupid ignorant hasty politicians using their controlled media are putting on the pressure and blocking the arguments of credible “rivals”. remember there have been huge scientific medical mistakes on record in history like the infamous usage for decades of the drug thalidomide which was a colossal disaster. one school of thought bordering on the spiritual. covid-19 is unstoppable. this is nature’s way of a total cleaning up of the world, of greedy sinful man and the atmosphere and the environment and the animal kingdom, that is to restore balance. covid-19 will disappear on its own.  think very very carefully. expose and listen to all views . let the individual decide. no forced vaccination."

"salty hello! you just slept for the last 100 yrs and emerge from the cave? food from where? drop from the sky or are you ok with eating grass and air? what about water? we are still buying water from malaysia or are you consuming raw rain water and toilet water without desalination? what about maintenance cost for your shelter/home - electronic gadget out of order or perhaps you don’t use modern electronic gadget? oops! forgotten that you just emerged from a cave! food, water, shelter all required $$$. surely, you don’t need a degree in economics to know these basic knowledge right? so its a matter of you die from virus or you die and became a hungry ghost. chances from dying from virus may not happen if you have the vaccine and if you do not have much health issues but without food and water, you will not last long"
"justfair you are comparing singapore to usa or uk? do uk how small our country is compared to theirs? is it okay for the country to go 1k case per day and it is still increasing previously from 1-10 case a day? are we not suppose to do smth abt it just becuz of ""economy"" . having a lockdown for 2weeks or so just to stop cases wont cause business to bankrupt my boy. the government still has plenty of reserves to spare if needed. nobody is spoilt here we are worried for our safety because of how small and dense our country please. learn some geography"
summer gal huh food water is everyday necessity. these kind of businesses will never go bankrupt wtf hahahahaha. not opening borders does not = to lesser crops/food/water. not opening borders does not = to unable to call some1 to come fix my toilet. pretty sure all these are common sense
justfair btw pretty sure endemic does not mean opening up borders to foreigners just for them to bring in more straints of viruses. delta variant is brought in from other countries so that isnt endemic.
"salty yes correct if you have the funds, but many will not have enough money to tide them over if we continue to lock ourself"
"salty the virus already all over everywhere all over the world. so how long are you going to lock yourself in? forever? close for 2 weeks, ok we’ll bring it down and then what?  how many 2 weeks are enough for the zero cases? not sustainable and definitely not long term solution"
"salty the number of death and the number in icu are the numbers we should be worried about. if daily cases are high, but these 2 numbers are relatively low, then we can treat this as normal flu."
"salty bro, just ignore this justfair. don't you know he is champion of carrying lhl marbles? while he was carrying, lhl farted and he say it smells like roses. another word for him. the ultimate paw lum par."
summer gal another paw lum par. anymore vacancy?
"justfair hey paw lum par, how is job doing? remember, don't drop lei. it's the most precious and important lum par in singapore"
"summer gal not sustainable so we ignore and let the covid case snowball... and wait till there is 1k deaths  per day and our hospital overwhelms then we do smth about it? its about preventing that from happening not waiting for it to happen bro. stop defending the idiots there is absolutely no justifiable reason we shld open our borders when our sitation here is chaotic af. only reason is about money and thats why i said money does not value more than human lives. we are not guinea pigs for experiment. they are toying with our lives just because of money. whats the rush of opening the borders when only a small percentage of the people in the world are allowed to travel? stop acting smart here its ridiculous, you wont get additional money for defending them. its because of people like you that we are not getting the change we deserve. people like you who defend whatever the people above are doing and does not criticise the most obvious things that they are doing wrong."
foghorn d hahahaha fax bro they think lhl=lky like they are two diff ppl bruh hahahahaha.l
foghorn d  still painful grumbling? grow up a bit and start living life. grumbling also no use. and no need to be so vulgar even though you are short on education. nobody owes you a living.
"justfair ironic of you talking about lack of education. reply to my shit fool since you have an ""abundance"" of education"
"salty  science shows that the countries who do lock down have poorer resilience. even in uk, the cases are not translated to serious hospital cases proportionately"
"salty bro, no need to talk these people. a fart smells like rose to a person is their brain already down in their ass."
"justfair btw, go paw your boss lum par la. subject doesn't make any cow sense at all."
foghorn d  cow sense or brain dense also no need to use vulgar language. we are a civilised society except that few but i certainly hope you are not in that latter category

fiost where's the link?  it's only opened to the hk public who are vaccinated?
lets close all borders...who cares how everyone related to tourism and travel industry is suffering...which is most of singapore..but clearly you are not...well all of singapore depends on open borders...so probably most companies will shut their offices here once we let noone travel...i hope you lose your job first...

"the answer to end covid! the person in malachi 4:5-6 is to restore truth to scripture and dispel the jezebel spirit. ⬅️ ✝️❣accepting a money offering is ok as long as you call it an offering. putting a price on it is not. ⛔selling books using the name of jesus, selling worship songs, selling bibles -- that is pure pagan worship!!  ⛔ a ""money seed"" denotes self-righteous behavior. it implies that someone can earn and buy a miracle, a prophesy, or spiritual gifts. did you buy your salvation? absolutely not.  god can not be bought; in fact, that's why jesus came -- to pay the price for us all! ✝️ ⛔ putting a price on the gospel in the form of books, songs, or anything else is called prostituting the gifts god gave you. it is pagan worship of money. telling someone they owe you 10% of their income is prostitution; it is a lie straight from satan. abusers of themselves, liars, greedy, thieves, and swindlers shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven. mathew 10:8 says, ""you received without payment so give without being paid"" and that is straight from the mouth of jesus himself.  ✝️❣since christ’s sacrifice of himself removed the curse of any man-made laws, the need for the old testament tithe is gone anyhow.  plus, 1 peter 2:9 states we are all priests now: ⚘""but you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, god’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.""  since we are all priests now, tithing does not even make sense.  and ... tithes weren't even entrusted to church leaders in the bible! they were sent to jerusalem and divided among the poor, the widows, the homeless, etc.  ✝️tithes were only food as well. you have pastors teaching that tithes were money, and by the biblical definition they weren't. any pastor that teaches monetary tithing is actually a prostitute. abusers of themselves, swindlers, and liars shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven. it's okay for a pastor to pass around an offering plate as long as he calls it an offering. but nowhere in the bible did they ever tithe with money. also, it was not just a barter system back then. that is another a lie that people teach to twist scripture. even abraham had silver. food was not the currency back then. the poor widow had two coins to give as an offering. ➡️❣some people will say that abraham tithed in genesis; that is not true either. he simply gave a 10% offering as a one-time offering from a plunder of war. he did not tithe over and over and it wasn't even a law back then.  <b>*</b> plus, read it; it says the lesser is always blessed by the superior!! that means anyone with more should always be blessing someone who has less. for a person to say that someone with less owes them money is one of the biggest lies of all. church leaders have convinced people that it is them they are supposed to give to, but it is not. we are supposed to be giving to the poor, the widows, and the homeless. the superior is to always bless the lesser!!!  ❣➡️ luke 10:7 states that anytime the bible refers to wages, it's ""eating and drinking whatever you are given."" 1 corinthians 16:1 the hebrew translation does not say money. and, who are the lord's people? who are the saints? all of us! ➡️❣ the correct translation of 1 corinthians: 9-11 is not ""to reap material things."" the correct translation is ""to reap carnal things."" carnal means ""flesh, fleshly."" it's talking about food. ""do not muzzle an ox as it is treading out the grain"" is also referring to food. the original translation of ""get a living from the gospel"" in verse 11 is actually ""from the gospel to live."" it's referring to food as well.  ➡️❣ i have also heard the argument about deurotomy 14: 22-26. people that were taught wrong will say it is an an example of a person tithing with money, but it's not. they sold their food for silver so they could go to the new land and buy whatever they wanted for themselves. it clearly says that ""you and your household shall eat there."" ➡️❣ in acts 5, everyone was told to sell their possessions so that it could be ""distributed to anybody in need."" this was not an act of tithing either; it is in direct correlation to acts 4:32. acts 4:32 says that ""all the believers were of one heart and one mind and they shared everything they had."" the bible even says that they laid the money at the apostles feet to be distributed to anyone who had need. ➡️❣ people want to logically ask, ""well, then how can a church stay open?"" for one, a pastor can go get a real job like anyone else if he or she wants money. working for the lord is not really a job; it is a calling and a privilege.   two: any church that is founded on lies or teaching lies is really no church at all; it is an operation of from satan.  in addition, i have heard the argument, ""but churches do good things with the money they get, like feeding people."" if somebody goes into a bank, kills everyone there, takes all the money and then decides to give it all to the poor, does that make it okay? absolutely not!!! therefore, condoning evil to attempt to do a little good is against god's ways as well. plus, they aren't helping because i have been in contact with 1000s and 1000s of church buildings and received one bottle of water. ⛔ according to peter, everyone is a pastor anyhow so why not tithe to ourselves and help the poor and homeless face-to-face? ❣ ✝️⚘the people are the church; the body is the holy temple -; tithe to yourself and go help the poor and homeless face-to-face!!!  ➡️and, malachi 3:8 is addressing the church leaders! malachi 2 clearly states that it is a warning for the priests (church leaders). god will turn back the coronavirus if church leaders repent. read malachi 3:8: church leaders everywhere have been robbing god! that is why we are under a curse!! it even states that in the passage between 8 and 11.  the entire nation has been robbing god and that is why the entire nation is under a curse: worship singers, book writers, people who sell things in church, church leaders, anyone whoever put a price on the gospel. it's time for anyone who has ever put a price on the gospel to repent! only then will god turn back the coronavirus. anyone who has ever taught monetary tithing or sold anything using the name of jesus needs to return the money to the storehouse. the storehouse was actually in jerusalem and it would equate to our government today. luke 12:33 says to sell your possessions and give it to the poor anyhow. and just know that if someone continues teaching a lie, judgment will come eventually. also, know that every time someone dies from the coronavirus, it's on church leaders, book writers, worship singers, etc. that refuse to repent.  ➡️paula white was told by god to get a prophetic message directly from me. she said god told her to email only certain people and she didn't know why but all my emails would go directly to her. look at the picture of the email below. you can clearly see that it says, “re” as in reply and this was not a mass email. this was august 17, 2020. she woke up with her hand on the phone on the morning after i sent her the prophetic message and even said she had the answer to heal the land!! but, she chose not to repent at that time. ezekiel 33, james 5, and malachi 3: 8-11 were the first 3 verses of the prophetic message. malachi 2 clearly states that malachi 3: 8-11 is telling church leaders they have robbed god. the entire nation is under a curse called covid because church leaders and anyone else that ever put a price on the gospel won't repent. now, paula white and all the major church buildings have known this for over a year. it's judgment time! prophets said they had one year to repent.  in 1973, david wilkerson said there will be this thing called the coronavirus and then church buildings will be taxed and shutdown. there are no true church buildings today anyhow because church buildings in biblical times housed poor and homeless people. plus, they all teach lies and then omit any passage that would require them to give. the bible says it's the poor, the homeless, the widows we are to reach and give to, not fake preachers that twist and lie about the word of god."

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl to malaysia, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."

"so what is your point....lock down the country for the next 5 years?. world has started to live with covid, whether you like it or not.... if you are too scared, just lock yourself inside your room and never come out"
"ramanathan for your information, more than half of the countries around the world are currently still on lockdown, especially more so during this period as winter approaches. so get your facts right before telling someone that the world has started to live with covid. only singapore is the goondu one continue to push to open their borders, other countries see us must be thinking 'wah so brave so fierce ah' but actually in fact we're just a bunch of clowns that do things without thinking."
"sean lim which world are you living in?. united states and european countries have opened their borders long time back. now india , thailand and few other asian countries have also opened their borders. keep in mind, all their vaccination rate is not even 70%. nobody is saying singapore is so fierce so brave, it should have opened its border much earlier, once we hit the 80% vaccination mark. you get your facts right."
"just because you lockdown, you think that singapore will be safe forever?. if there are new variants emerging somewhere else in the world, no matter how much lockdown you propose, the virus will somehow sneek in. so once for all, stop all this non-sense of locking down."
"​ramanathan first of all are you even singaporean? you logic is like no matter how you lock your house, someone will somehow still break in. so must as well leave your window, gate and door wide open."
"a tan i am a singaporean. do you go around asking these questions to everyone? first of all, your logic here doesn't apply to virus. we have experienced it before, even after lockdown and border restrictions, the variants were still able to sneek in. now with more 85% vaccination rate, we should understand that and open the borders. that is the point."
stupid people do stupid policy and continue their folly. they continue to bring in covid-19 by letting people in and boast about their stupid act and feel happy doing it.

wise decision! please keep wfh as default.
like and follow your frequenly news
have they seriously thought this through in making the decision to open to india and indonesia? their covid cases is very high... wouldnt it be sensible to open our doors to countries with low covid cases first? no?
love 💘 for 💰💰💰💰 is strong.  now ave daily 14-17 deaths  let's go for 20+
india has more cases really 👏 👏 👏
it's all about enterprise and cronies businesses and benefits at the expense of life-safeties as the move is seen to be against the data and logic. please dispense away with the pretense excuses. these days it's getting harder to trust what they say.
vtl with india is so obvious that its not about safety
now the mmtf is doing the cha cha. two steps forward three steps back.  hope they will not do the rock and roll.
now deaths in mid teens soon 20+ daily deaths  song boh
it's not even funny. embarrassing
next dance steps will be the tango......
travel at your own risk
"every 28 days about 90k over people are infected. in just 10 months, at least more than 1 million people would have already been infected with the virus. no wonder; singapore removed from eu travel list, may affect vtls - on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country, the eu said: ""they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid-19, as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources. ref: asiaone miw failed internationally? hide hr numbers, hide total accumulated numbers, hide vax / non vax? or what? bloomberg’s covid resilience ranking, singapore drop 20 places to rank at 39 even worse than africa. according to us cdc, singapore at level 4, very high risks of covid level/infection. r-rating [reproduction rating] is not even internationally recognized regardless how they want to ""re-invent"" the data maybe only can fool some 61%, you say?"
"the vaccinated pap ministers should all infect themselves with covit-19 and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said, then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory."
can you learn how to spell covid-19 lol
single party is unwise and dangerous.

the expert should be expelled. talking crap.
i’m not going to any white country- i don’t want to get spitted on 😵‍💫
not everyone in a 'white' country is anti-asian.  most are peace-loving people who loves people visiting their country.
germany has a much more liberal and accepting population than the us. don't assume the worst of the western world just because of the stuff the media portrays.
i love travel yea… not after covid
funny story
"imo main reason is military overseas training in germany and brunei, dont think leisure travel was priority when opening these vaccinated travel lanes"
probably. what a smart way to make a loophole dedicated to military personnel.
whether it's leisure or business it's going to have little impact. forcing travelers to stay at one place for not less than 21 days and other restrictions obviously is not a kind of tourists friendly measures.
mad hatter wonderland it’s 21 days within germany which is big country
"the policy maker in this particular choice of needs a brain vaccine against illogical decision. i live in europe just before coming back, and germany isn't as safe as singapore! i pray this won't become a fiasco. so silly. check with our embassy in belgium/germany, if necessary.  ps. i hope people are not so naïve as to believe in ""news"" without healthy scepticism, in this present age."
i great news to me because i am working  with a german company.
no one cares
"if you can easily feel happy just by a single news headline without looking deeper into it, you also can easily feel depressed by a single news headline. your emotions would in the end dictated by the mainstream media. truth or falsehood have little meanings."
notaweeboo well care enuf foryouto comment on my post. thats is funny
mad hatter wonderland hahahaha....u are judging me by my comment andyouthinkyouknow me already?youthink i dont just read the headline and nvr give a second thought? kesian lah kau ni.
you should go back to indonesia.
she should go back to malaysia lah
"stay safe, hope everything works out well for you."
"for people who doesn’t have any business or relatives in brunei, who wanna travel there lol 😂  no alcohol furthermore"
no ktv also. haha.
i've been to brunei on a stopover.  so boring.
"brunei is an empty land full of oil and cheap properties. to be honest, the houses look really nice but forests everywhere. :-/"
lim wowo it’s just not a place for tourists i guess.
better don’t rush once you kena forever stay home or bye bye 👏👏👏
5226 case in 83 million population. approx .06 case per 1000 is safe country.  38000 case in 1.36 billion population. approx 0.028 case per 1000. country is unsafe. i don't understand the logic.
add amsterdam
y germany? is too expensive
woit gundu you think we have so much money to travel to far away country hah like yours no sweating work but have so much money hah+÷=/€£¥₩)(&^$#!
the criteria are quite puzzling. the four territories vary a fair bit in terms of new cases and vaccination rates. so what determines whether a country is on this list?
oktoberfest is cancelled this year. very knowledgeable expert lol
omg that is so true! 🤣 🤣 🤣
the kind of expert we rely on wtf
"next, he will suggest that we go to tomorrowland lol"
wait for it people.  this mtf is asking for another more lengthy cb.  by or before september they'll trigger a major spike - vaccine or not.
please replace this male news presenter..... his accent/english is never up to par with other news presenters....
"replace the female one pls... no long hair, no cleavage no talk."
"pap will be remembered if all of these abandon rush to open up singapore for the sake of money, end up in deaths. i will be laughing out loud if one of their families is the ones among the dead."
so negative mindset..pap so far had succed control the virus..
trust the pp leadership who in turn absolutely trust the experts committee for covid19.  the entire pp & ecv19 in turn absolutely unequivocally trust cdc/fda/who. which such powerful nexus working hand in hand everything become predestined.
"dee bu soh not at all. you discounted the fact singapore is small and what does now got to do with what will happen? second, nation wide testing was never done. third, reports are never accurate. the virus itself is hard to detect.  you totally forgot that opening borders to countries which itself is in chao, are going to invite chao in. then again, thinking logically was never singsporean abilities. vaccine does not protect you from the virus. it reduce you from suffering worse from it and the odd of possible death.  it does not stop the virus from spreading. it can be inside you while you are already vaccinated. the pap have constantly blank out these facts about the vaccines as well."
zhang songquan 忠言逆耳
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcjmenzl-x0&t=2m04s2:04 suggesting that singaporeans visit the oktoberfest seems irresponsible. however, the german authorities announced in may that <b>there will be no oktoberfest 2021.</b> which makes one wonder how professional/reliable this travel agents' spokesman is …"
president of travel agent says go for oktoberfest in germany. doesn't he know oktoberfest  canceled back in may ?
"as much as i am excited by the news, we shouldn't be celebrating too quickly. germany's rollout of the vaccine isn't on the same level as singapore, with higher cases daily. then there's the risk of the colder climate affecting the severity of the virus and what if another lockdown is initiated. how do we get back into the country if singapore enters another lockdown period or if germany goes into lockdown."
even during lockdown singaporeans could have always entered singapore with just shn
"not sure, if i would go to germany in winter. the virus situation can change in the cold climate. however, i believe sia allows free cancellation until 7 days before the trip, and should there be an official travel warning any time. if you decide to go towards this year's end, then go to a place with a good christmas market. they are called weihnachtsmarkt. weihnachtsmarkts are beautiful, and they do have the best seasonal mood in the world. examples are nurnberg, munchen, leipzig. you may also include the alps, the mountains look gorgeous with a snow cap, and the capital  berlin."
sq prices to germany are skyrocketing now btw...
"if we have another circuit breaker after this, then who will take accountability?"
us.
they will said due to unvaccinated people.
"wong kok kiong how to blame unvax when most vax are the ones travelling? anyway, they will find excuses to pass the buck."
lucy yeo  this is what i'm trying to say.
profit muhammed be careful of your name ya. look at what the muslim did when someone drew something about islam in paris.
looking at the vtl vaccination travel lane. in reality it's worse than the current travel restrictions. nothing much will change come sept 8.
7 th months again
"german has 5k daily cases and less than 40% fully vaccinated, i don't understand the logic here opening up to germany?"
"well, germany has a population of around 84 million compared to singapore's 5 million, and with a little math done and percentages calculated, the proportion of cases are roughly the same"
they have not included the rest 25 countries' statistics.
"edgar winoc did you comprehend that you can't go without restriction to any other country than germany at this moment? no 25 other countries, or you do it illegally."
"aaron it's not the same, in germany it's about 7.5 times higher. (sin 7-day average is 51 per 5.7 million = 8.9 per million; ger 7-day average is 5.700 per 84 million = 67.9 per million.) google 'singapore covid cases chart'."
"what are you talking about, germany has 58% of its population fully vaccinated."
"peter kroll as per ecdc recommendations and most of the eu and schengen area are currently green, as well as some third-party countries: albania, australia, new zealand, ukraine, singapore, south korea, japan, north macedonia, serbia, hong kong, macau, taiwan, armenia, azerbaijan, bosnia and herzegovina, brunei darussalam, canada, kosovo, moldova, montenegro, qatar and saudi arabia. travelling from germany to other labelled green, one don't have to do it illegally."
edgar winoc you can only travel to germany when using this travel arrangement.
"peter kroll currently, singaporeans can already travel to germany without serving a quarantine there -  regardless of vaccination status."
"edgar winoc the point is not going there, it's when you are coming back."
"aaron we have more than 6 million. we are infested with malaysian, ceca+ families, foreign workers including maid"
"peter kroll i have found the answer to my reply. thank you. next time, learn to read and comprehend the reply before 'fact-checking' on others."
"edgar winoc the new rule is unitary for those who travel from singapore to germany. germany had allowed already unitary travels from singapore. originally you were asking about the other 25 countries, which you can not visit under this rule. how do you rate your cognitive skills? or do you just want to stir the shxt?"
edgar winoc exactly. most people were actually deluded by the media as though they can't travel or severely restricted to travel to germany or europe prior to ctf. which is absolutely untrue. vtf makes little difference to those who has business need to travel.
peter kroll i suspect you meant to say 'the new rule is unilateral...' not unitary.
"edgar winoc anyway, who will benefit? i am german living here since '95. we are 3, all of us fully vaccinated. still we need approximately singapored 900 for pcr tests, if we want to travel. at the current sky-high ticket prices we would have to pay about singapored 5800, plus accommodation and other costs in germany. i can't afford this. my parents are 87 yo and 83 yo., both fully vaccinated. i have not seen them since 2 years. i am afraid they die before i can see them again. this vaccinated-travel rule seems more like a marketing stunt, than anything else."
peter kroll we feel your angst. you are not alone. the least you can do is to communicate with your family back in germany as much as time allows. stay strong.
"edgar winoc thank you for the wishes, edgar"
yeay!  i can see my friends again!
stay there and don’t return to spread the virus.
richard wong jealous? 🤣
germany is a nice country but very far and pricey. i'm waiting for japan & korea.
same.  i waiting for wuhan china 21 days tour
germany is not pricey. switzerland is
qi tein da sheng great sage swiss is one of the most expensive among all countries in the world 😅 but yeah i meant many people would prefer nearby asian countries cuz of less distance and less expensive thats all 👍
"hahahahah it's not pricey tbh. it's pretty manageable, not too cheap but not too expensive too"
let's move on. hopefully more % of the population gets vaccinated (since thats the norm now) and just open it up and go. things gotta move..the world and economy got to get going. fittest survive. covid isnt the only thing that can harm human.. so.. lets move on.
"rushing to germany or elsewhere  at such times when covid is still raging mercilessly  in many countries is hardheaded , fanatical and absolutely foolhardy .  even  more so , are our thoughtless and idiotic  "" ministers ""  🐕💩💩💩"

"indonesia’s tourism minister sandiago uno has just announced a reduction of the mandatory self-isolation period for overseas arrivals from eight days to five. by christmas, indonesia probably set to quarantine day to 0. and singapore ??"

a rapid resurgence in s.korea n extended social distancing curbs. open up vtl is a stroke of genius.  singapore next target 20k cases
people south korea already don't look at cases. here in singapore here kpkb about cases.
lisa lim agree. one rabid case like you is deemed too many.
"next up, korea!"
im pretty sure south korea is having second thoughts now with covid cases hitting 5000 a day.
it's easy to catch a cold in winter. better be safe than sorry. go after feb 2022.

"death , pushing of blame , regret , anguish and loss of hope. singapore will pay."
claim from the country that this virus is developed and stop blaming singapore.
india has perfected the art of covid-19 mutations spreading round the globe
why forgein workers required 14 day quarantine?
"the vaccination rate in south korea is pretty high (about 56%) as compared to the countries of the foreign workers. again, i am not sure what you mean by 'foreign workers'. do you mean manual labour and other non-expat people? if so. most of the 'foreign workers' in singapore comes from south asia (like india and bangladesh) and other parts of south east asia (e.g. the philippines). the vaccination rates in those countries are generally pretty low (india is about 18%, bangladesh about 11%, and philippines is about 22%). also, south korea has consistently been one of the countries that managed to contain covid. this probably explains why the treatment for them is different as based on the risk level."

taiwan has 0 local cases today. lawless wrong sweating profusely.
"yes, we should follow whatever they do. shut our borders tight, reject all foreigners, stop all works that need them n focus in training and persuading all our people to learn to grow n eat grass n bulid our own flats instead. no more wfh n stretch our heads how to have more jobs, all work on rooftop to grow veg, yay!!!!"
previously singapore had zero cases as well so it is not impossible for taiwan cases to be increased in future as covid will be around.
"we now having art,  swabs 2 time per week,   increasing covid cases....l think not save to travel taiwan , china n hk ,  don""t believe them...hiding facts..."
why korea want open travel with singapore with high covid case?
it's calculated move ... so singapore is safe in foreigners' 👀
because we're higher
a rapid resurgence in s.korea n extended social distancing curbs. open up vtl is a stroke of genius.  next target  for singapore 20k cases

"as i have perceived, the sniffing device is unable to differentiate with amongst the viruses and is largely on an experimental basis with many factors and conditions affecting its parameters. in essence, it's like my made in china suction fan mosquito trap, for example, it just merely sucks any insects and has no ability to differentiate them. but nevertheless, they should install working devices in public transports like the mrts and the buses, but i think these systems are the untouchable ""enterprise"" systems, if you know what i mean."
can invent a device to sniff out 🐃💩
stay safe use all measure to prevent each other's
just drop all quarantine lah... open more pcr neighborhood testing centers.
"opa opa!!!! crazy lol. korea fans long waited. i am waiting for oppai oppai, japan..."
"yeah both korea & japan seems to be the most expensive yet the most popular destinations among singaporeans 🙂 nonetheless, harsh winter is upcoming must be careful 👍"
quarantine free = drop all measures
so what happens if i land only to find someone sitting behind on the flight became contagious in the 48 hours since testing ??? would i end up having to 7-14 days of quarantine in singapore instead of sight seeing ?? not so sure i want to take that chance. in any case at around 4k cases a day in singapore i might just hold back before visiting a danger zone.
vtl but discriminate own unvaccinated citizens? shameful
missing singapore so much love from australia
singapore has no goh keng swee
"thank you gov for the vtl, all atas destinations. thank you."

"magnus thor lol, since when are ccp minions considering singapore as the same country? we allergic to commies leh"
travellers entering singapore also need to follow the measures and locals get to travel to the countries under vtl agreement with singapore as well.
megalord ng i see china as the major source of destabilization factor in the world with their rise in economic and military power and their acts of aggression.   it resembles the rise of powerful germany under hitler which eventually led to world war 2.  i hope china suffer the same consequences so that there can be peace in the whole world.

oyo axum that is the risk we take for opening up.  else we will always be in our tortoise shells. so be practical!  one dayyougot to go around looking for a wife.  after some courtships with some girlsyoudecide on one.  thenyougot married.  then she did not turned out to be that perfect after all.  your aunties and uncles start to criticiseyoufor making such a choice.  did your initial decision to find a wife wrong?  oryouforever remain single so nothing for your aunties and uncles to criticise.
haiya... they dowan la... singapore covid cases is uncontrollably high wheras the rest of the world is opening up again.... hahhaa
you will be surprised at how mistaken you are.
magnus thor how exactly? hmm..
bang tongkat so far haveyouheard of any country cancelling their vtl with us?  thats why i sayyoumistaken.
"magnus thor i hope they do for their own safety. even so, could you be so kind as to provide me with countries that are actively opening vtl's?"
"magnus thor you opened the vtl, but noone will come. im sur eyou know what ""extending a travel lane is"""
"bang tongkat we are just going through a phase,soon we will exit this pandemic like other countries."
"michael z123x true, but at this moment countries should proceed with caution with singapore, they seem behind."
"bang tongkat they are a bit more....brave,while we are too cautious.the thing is: i've read a lot of comments bout why we are facing this while other countries are now returning to normal, and they blame the leadership.truth is: in early days we were spared while the rest suffered the full onslaught of the virus.and the virus is like - pay now or pay http://later.so/later.so now we are paying."
"bang tongkat france, denmark, italy, the united kingdom, the netherlands, spain, the united states and canada are the latest additions to a growing list of countries for which singapore is implementing vtls. these countries had already unilaterally re-opened to vaccinated travellers from singapore.  just google."
michael z123x in the early days pretty sure sing was also the worst in asean for covid. dunno where you got that from but sure.
"magnus thor i cannot confirm that may be true from online sources, maybe your source is from local or state-tv that i cannot access, but even then, all i ask for is them to proceed with caution to singapore, and for them to not risk their lives. personally i think singapore should be responsible and close their borders so that they can bring covid under control."
"bang tongkat for infection yeah,but the death rate was lowest; about less than forty for the first year."

these people are so much smarter than novax djokovic
the reason they do not mandate testing the vaccinated is because they would be positive and they don't want the world to know that the vaccines are a failure.
dont you have to isolate while waiting on results !
no point now the children can get vaccinated
hi singapore kids on december 27th for age under 12 years old children should be get vaccine and then go back to school after new years's eve for return to school. that's why on the boxing day start toward please take your vaccine soon.
"gar ni na do one art test face like the swab poke all the hole, those who need to do everyweek or every day be like 🤣"
"i'm sorry but at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd1hsrfv3gw&t=8m30s8:30 , her mask isn't covering her nose. pls as parents , fix it. she's unvaccinated......"
i see those poor people with slippery noses everywhere!  such an affliction
lol... travelling with unvaccinated kids... must be fun
"i actually live in sydney and omicron is exploding. of course, it is the obvious choice to stay home but our choice is to be careful and wear mask and don't touch everywhere :) and don't go to high risk places"
very safe because they have immunity. unlike the vacinated. who has filled the hospital
<b>this is a complete nightmarish travel experience cos its too regimented and constraint and all those testings are hassling and suspenful and the costs are  bloodsucking honestly i wouldnt even travel for free</b>
why australia? you might get smashed because of your look. they love public civil obedience and disturbance over the smallest dissatisfaction to express their immaturity.
you are awesome!!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 let's visit malaysia with vtl 😍
waw my negative comment got removed
"someday i hope under 12 years old children to take the vzccine like as pfizer, moderna, sinovac, sinopharm etc. like in china and the us under 12 years old are doing the covid vaccine."
"travel if necessary else at this stage, the sign of virus gone is still not guaranteed since it keep transforming. don't rush to travel unless you have time, money and patience to burn, else remain within your boundary. human visible fighting the invisible.. not easy 😂 😂"
"holiday travel warning: do not travel into any jurisdiction with a high prevalence of unconscious, covidiot politicians, news reporters, witch doctors, or border guards suffering from covid psychosis, masskholeitis, or vassxinolia mindfuckosis. your wellbeing is at risk."
"agreed,atleast wait untill all these criminals prosecuted in nuremberg 2 trials."
the real question is do you guys ready to get infected or getting other  infected?
sydney and nsw no longer need to isolate 72 hours after arrival
"true and today they had 3,000 cases and you don't have to wear a mask."
"its not how safe, its more like how lucky."
"another great clip from steven chia, love watching good vibes in sydney."
"unfortunately now in nsw, our covid case numbers are sky-rocketing again."
most people don't want to learn from 2003 sars and delta (and any pandemic in history) just love to play dumb. the only weapon you have against pandemic is both quarantine and vaccine.
"weakening people, the media are the virus, lockdown the media!"
"over 50,000 breakthrough cases (sick w covid) in arizona alone, but it's a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated""?"
take all four jabs.
"just a reminder, kids themselves can be covid carrier. if you want to ban unvaccinated adults, then ban unvaccinated kids as well. both are at risk of carrying covid."
there's no difference between vaxxed and unvaxxed in terms of ability to spread the virus.
"better vaccinate, if they wish to travel, children are also carrier of virus as much as elders. or stay home safely very simple."
shockingly misinformed post. cant believe people are still making such nonsensical statements after so long.
expert knowledge not from medical but economic studies....
"y'all just don't understand.....it's not abt who can spread the virus , it about how the unvaxxed will have more severe symptoms than the vaxxed and fill up hospital beds"
_eliza_goh we have been hearing this for two years now and still hasn't happened. perhaps invest in better healthcare instead of shutting down countries?
just wear a mask easy fix
"who cares if the brat dies ?? how safe it is for the rest of us if he doesn't get vaccinated, just give to him or keep him home. kids are a disease."
"i don't think we'll see a ""pre-pandemic"" travel that we used to have for the next 3-5 years."
more like forever. as long as people keep complying blindly to their lies
blackbannerz sad but true
unvaccinated kids are allowed whereas unvaccinated adult are not allowed.. where's the logic?  take a healthy adult vs a healthy kid  and an unhealthy adult vs unhealthy kid then we'll see a balanced data.
"i also don't understand the logic behind ""kids don't need to wear mask"", i know that it can ""teach"" their immune systems but remember that they could also become carrier to their parents/grandparents!"
morgan that why they are also going to be vaccinated lah. if not what we all dont travel and lockdown is it.
kids have stronger adaptabillity to covid19. simple as that
"for the covid-19 pfizer vaccine, researchers found that kids ages 5 to 11 had a similar immune and safety response at one-third the dose used for those ages 12 and up. in other words the children immune system is not fully developed yet so they give a lower dose but according to logic they should give a double dose. coronavirus vaccine has again proven to have nothing to do with any disease or virus."
the question is how safe is being vaccinated ?
lol vaccines
"meanwhile here, even we belong to one of  top countries with super high vaccination rate, someone  still constantly thinking of boaster and even 4th boaster .....want endemic but humji to open...only thing in his mind is only boaster and boaster , nothing else"
must be nice to have the money to travel and not worry abt extra expenses.
you only live once!
yah lah!
"calling the price of the flights as ""covid-19 related expenses"" is a bit disingenuous."
very dangerous to bring kids for holiday cause they want to go to toilet than what happens to the kids have covid19 oversea than they have no hospital
"mel the majority of kids will not have severe symptoms from covid,"
"how about featuring families struggling during covid as well, only a minority can afford to travel during the pandemic!"
"agreed,this is the real selfishness."
"only few people can afford to travel, at the best of times."
"maria hewitt i do agree,however what wrong with cna doing this? this is also a lesson that people need to know that you don't travel just for the sake of vacation.there is a risk especially with a young child."
land farak nay padta
more change of being bitten by a venomous deadly snake spider
germany?   opening up for for military purpose?
isn't it for tourists??
"god's amazing grace perhaps,  military is another likely reason"
god's amazing grace brunei n germany r two military training places
des chan  you have a valid point
god's amazing grace i dont think there is any tourist from these two places
"damn.  the 4g idiots really messed up.  344 cases out of 5m population is like 90,000 cases in china.  germans will be rewarded with a covid virus to bring home.  singapore is worse than china covid situation."
so vaccine passport a conspiracy now? 😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣
"your app showing you are vexed is already in itself a vexsin ""passport"""
god's amazing grace lord have mercy 🤣🤣😇😇🤭🤭
"we have new expert popping out everyday, where are the former experts now?"
went home :)))
what was the point of rushing to 80% vaccinated if they will take their time to open up the borders to vaccinated travelers...
you meant the point for getting people vaccinated in singapore was for travelers to come in?
sort your thoughts and recall what exactly was promised to you via vexsination !! you will realized you have been duped!! vexsin has given you two hollow promises!! * life returning to normal good old days!! *fully vexsinated are fully protected!!
hiring germany people  getting covid delta  free flight  healthcare  staying  1 day before covid thanks
germany is having 4th wave due to delta n expect 1.4k approved to arrive.  geniuses
singapore should open up to all fully vaccinated travellers. more than 80% of singaporeans have been fully vaccinated. this virus is not going away anytime soon.
y? youreally thinkyour protected after vaccinated?
des chan yes
john ji 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
john ji good luck
strong delusion
god's amazing grace he will find out the hard way
"des chan i don't say this without reasons. let's look at the numbers that speak volume. 1. number of daily cases on the unvaccinated vs vaccinated 2. number of deaths on the unvaccinated vs vaccinated 3. number of hospitalizations on the unvaccinated vs vaccinated 4. number of people in icu, on ventilators on the unvaccinated vs vaccinated   i'm sure moh will be able to provide you the above numbers to show why singapore made such a decision to slowly ease and open up."
"god's amazing grace strong delusion, may be the other way. when will singapore open up? you will surely eliminate this virus if you behave like north korea ""nobody in and nobody out"". the singapore economy will surely collapse and many singaporeans will surely starve to death."
john ji 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣   y ryouso ignorant?
john ji did moh reported those numbers?  pls go read up b4 comment
des chan yes
des chan i'm in line with the singapore government. we will see who's ignorant very soon.
let's see vaccine long term side effects first. you seem to be dying to have more people come in.
john ji didyoulook at those data?
john ji in line with singapore govt is stupid
des chan yes i did
"des chan singapore government has been transparent, upfront and inform their citizens every step along the way. they have done everything possible to protect singaporeans. what's there not to trust singapore?"
tess dra this virus has been killing us in so many ways right in front of our eyes. the vaccines have been administered worldwide for more than 18 months now. data has shown that it's working. do you really want to go in and out of lock down or semi lock down for months and years to come? this will ruin the economy and starve people to death. that's the long term side effects that we all have to deal with.
john ji data show its working🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
des chan it's working.
john ji its not
des chan let's agree to disagree. time will prove who's right or wrong.
john ji its proven.  time not needed
"des chan oh well, i have to say you're wrong."
"john jiyoucan say anythingyouwant.  the fact is, vaccines is not working"
"des chan you can say anything you want. the fact is, vaccines are working perfectly fine."
john ji 😂🤣😂🤣😂 those infected r vaccinated.  youdont know?
"des chan oh yes,  break through infection that is."
john ji ?😂🤣
"45,000 rip 450,000 injuries as of 25th june: american database of adverse drug reactions for covid-19 “vaccines” (actual numbers are likely 10x)"
50++ per million.
"these figures grossly underestimate. i know of families who is extremely fanatical about vaxxine, they don't want to report their family members died because of that. they use all kinds of excuse to hide the cause and government officials is behind helping."
yeah sure champ....

"thank you cna for this report on singapore's covid-19 situation, from me and the gospel music ministry i serve in. also thank god, one of our recent songs ""lost without you"" fits in very well with the urgency of your report, this song i hereby dedicate to you and all viewers with the fervent hope of god's swift intervention to demolish this pandemic: https://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbghttps://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbg"
"besides malaysians that stay in jb and come to work in singapore daily, there is another group of singaporeans who stay in jb that needs to come to work in singapore and return to jb daily. please allow land vtl gurantine free travel both ways for this group too, especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only 2 or less passengers or upto 4 paxs if they are immediate family members. all vaccinated. also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in jb should be facilitated to allow 2 way vtl gurantine free land travel soonest possible. this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over 20 months now just because they couldn't return to their jb homes."
oh dear i did not know that only malaysia can provide workpermit holders to local companies.
hire me. i know tech and finance.
lift the lockdown it should be the governments job to protect and feed us. i guess the only option is freeganism.
schedule lah 1 mth 1 person only can go back
they paying malaysian the same with singaporean . whats the problem?
just give malaysian the privilege to take leaves and go home first as we are suffering from homesickness and mental torture.
"as singaporean i apologise on behalf of my country n cna for above lack of empathy report for especially our lower income f&b/manual/and other aspect labour workers. i am sorry when they are proudly claiming their low rate of  foreigner staff to be able to finally head home (some after two years) mainly due to the cost incurred concern.(is like this guys saying oh i know my staff very few can afford to go back based on how much i pay them.. oh wait i am on tv, let me xianyouanother reason )  how my countries shamelessly charge a high prc price etc with all the other 'expenses' to hold those who need to choose between affording for their family or their mental health. lets keep stricter law to explode the poor from poorer countires rather that costing all our govt officer families/extended families /in laws/friends businesses to have to pay more reasonable rates to attract locals"
ask oppie seetoh of makansutra can employ locals easily or not? mission impossible he would tell you  and he is champion oppie
"i supposed those long months earning n savings finally get to be with family, maybe even malaysian one people one nation, go against their govt who said, ""we will make life difficult for those not vas."
why are we hiring malaysians (and also filipinos) for pme jobs? these kind of jobs should go to locals first.
locals don't want lah. go ask oppie seetoh of makansutra.  he will tell you locals are very hard to employ. surely you can trust a king oppie
fiost not true. it is those blue collar jobs that locals shun. pmes are white collar jobs.
"malaysian workers, indian workers, chinese workers,  lanka workers, us workers, eu workers, burmese workers, thai workers, pakistani workers, bangala workers, pinoy workers, indonesian workers, viet workers....they have one common denominator...'workers'...these workers have to return home one day...except one particular group that is been neglected ...the singaporean workers who have no where to go..."
employ singaporean if all the f&b have not enough man power. look after your own country men . don't because foreigners  labour are cheap so the employees only employ foreigners but not singaporean!
ask oppie seetoh of makansutra.  he will tell you mission impossible  very hard to hire locals  seetoh is king oppie. you should be able to trust him
singapore is heading for big trouble
"better lah gundu you make money we locals have suffered alot ...standard of living are so high our locals pay make us suffered you make money ...foreigners too ..we locals get rises of transportation ,rental,utility...fine here fine there cut your salary is better gundu"
"family members vaccinated still cannot meet as we like. only 2 persons , 2 visits a day. now household members can dine together but not family members.  but everyday thousands of foreigners coming in. govt opening up recreational facilities fr old and young.   all these means more cases while the rest of us, vaccinated must stay home as much as possible. doesnt make sense to me"
inevitable. choose between mental health and economy.
there is no place like home exspecialy those who love  to be back home to family united but prepare to more money for the vtl  govt is thinking carefully between vtl on air and vtl on land the price. pay what ever you have to be back home is more important money can earn back.
"the relationship between viral dose and covid-19 severity: tulane researchers chad roy, ph.d., and dr. gregory bix --- this review found that the virus is primarily transmitted through the inhalation of particles containing virus    and that the ability of those particles  concentration of viral particles plus the length of time one is in  contact with those particles ultimately determines one's exposure. importantly, the team concluded that the viral dose, or amount of infectious virus transmitted from one person to another, does not appear  to affect disease severity. in practical terms, this means that an individual who inhales a greater number of infectious particles will not  necessarily experience more severe disease than an individual who is infected with a smaller amount."
thank you singapore for looking after us.
"covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant. covid-vaccine is a obstruction of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine-sulfate"

we need tourism in singapore. and tourism won't end anytime soon. we have to learn to live with the disease. testing and vaccines are a good way to move forward.
wait for 10 years also not possible without mask.
premature opening will hv catastrophic effect that beyond their competency to manage!!!
it won't. tourists are vaccinated and need 4 pcr tests!

interesting.... how wil ica know if any eu passport has been in germany 21days before depart to singapore?...... mtf mil$ math!
can check with iata ufta.
"boba fett dude, havyoubeen to eu countries? cross border no need stamp passport"
jimbaran residence they have ai trace tracking.
"boba fett eu has 27 countries, which has ai tracking? germany is the gateway to singapore. when they cross border each other, no checking. germany 5g network is worst, seem likeyouhav more to learn.... nice try dude!"
jimbaran residence ai can even detect 27000 countries seamlessly.
"boba fett in the world, there r only 195 countries.... sori, las msingapore toyoualien."
jimbaran residence actually you are an alien in your own planet cos there are over hundred thousands countries on earth and many of it are underwater which only me can reach those kingdoms.
"so is the short answer ' yes'?  if a breakthrough case occurs, the vtl will be closed for maybe 14 days. if more cases are discovered, the vtl shall be closed indefinitely?"
"i am not sure about germany. seems like their number of cases is pretty much in the four digits ballpark. well, then again what do i know? i’m just a blue collar worker who happens to accidentally glanced through nytimes."
"compared to other european countries (italy, france, spain, netherlands, uk), germany is able to keep the outbreak relatively stable and see no drastic spikes to the 20,000+ daily cases"
now singapore is ever ready to go to the next lap and singapore will succeed because the majority of singapore has been vaccinated.
🏀s to you
majority of singaporeans are eager for travel lanes with japan and korea and particularly malaysia. germany and australia are beautiful nations but i would say not as popular and affordable.
singapore will fail !!!

good job to our govt by welcoming tourist

eric phua i am disappointed only vtl. the more the merrier as the faster we shall reach herd immunity😆
ßpęřm . would like to but resource at hospital doesn't allow at moment. need to wait till covid situation improved in singapore.
eric phua now you know why singapore could wait for most having vaccinated right? cos countries are much larger than singapore. they cannot have waited for high vaccinated rate
"open to most european countries but not thailand, indonesia & china. can ensure these countries control of covid are the best when open up? hopefully, stop finger pointing at singapore citizens"
this country have very   very  very low child birth rate mean  1 child per woman  only  so it's very very very easy to keep here peaceful environment and to do development
"even if there were few imported infections, we would be exporting infections. the government wants to continue the covid19 legacy, so that the global pandemic will go on forever."

"welcome, you can hire a car from me. all are covid free cars .."
which car got covit ?🤣
"cases are a sad story here yet these travelers still don't mind visiting. anyway, welcome to singapore and be safe."
what the f&^%! then unban the unvaccinated now! what e hell is the point of this logic when we know that the spike in cases has nothing to do with e unvax and yet singapore is allowing 8 different countries in???!! how can you treat your own citizens this way and discriminate people who call this country their home??!! this is not right!
be wary of the anti vaxer comments from people who were first to vaccinate.
first to does not mean that they did not wake up.
"i hate this decision tbh. they need at least a day or two quarantine, because, hey, you may be vaccine but it takes one slip and they can be carrier too. hate this decision....."
mystery to the sudden spike in the number of covid-19 infections in singapore during the month of september & the tightening measures to kick in from 27 september to 8 october 2021 is unveiled. 5018 germans and 210 bruneians were allowed entry into singapore.  who is the real culprit for thousands of cases on a daily basis?
"well done, task force"
😵😵😵
mtf thrust foreigner more then their own citizen..👎👎
complain all you want. learn to live with the virus as singapore slowly opens up to get the economy moving. government can't continue to give money to business and workers to close their doors and not working. go get vaccinated or lose your rights to access many things in your daily life.
welcome at a really wrong time where winter is coming!!!!
vaccinated people are okay. they are. we should be more concerned for our unvaccinated.  latest: 9 deaths  6 are unvaccinated  2 are partially vaccinated  1is vaccinated  data is consistent
a brilliant idea to bring in the new lambda varriant when we cant even handle delta varriant from ceca
how many more do you want to see catching the flue n dieing before you stop your stupid system going forward.
shukri ram ram lee burger  what a great reply 👏
abdul majid  are you a terrified easily? stay in a hole is also scary as it is dark
but if 90% vaccinated singaporeans survive from covid infection does that not mean 90% singaporereans will have long term natural immunity effective for all variants??
please don't blame the people or the un -vaxxed for any future infection spike due to these foreign travellers into singapore. we have spoken.
nobody will blame you. there are a lot of families who couldn't see each other. there are students who need internships.there are business people who need to travel spore cannot be only about you
"come on. this is just the 2nd  or 3rd trials for vtls? and theres a limit to hoe many can enter. out of thousands less than 10 were positive after enter. they suppose to test nrgative before entering. dont be so anti foreigner and overact . border cant close forever . hotels, tourism, aviation, those singaporean working on these sectors has to survive"
"the nation that tried on so called zero case strategy , nz has close to 80 new cases today. they closed for how long?yougo and count. much much longer. see where they ars today. zero case strgery would hardly work"
"voters have spoken, we prefer to open our borders and live free."
please dont blame anyone for  your decision not to vaccinate
j c  well said
"they can't get infected or become carriers,??? 🤔"
"as long as one is vaccinated, it's not that risky"

"for safety reason, india is imposing a 7-d quarantine for travelers from s g."
indonesia cases are still high based on the arrival test.
singapore is higher
agnostik is better the border control is based on the arrival traveler that tested positive. you can travel to singapore with a quarantine order.
indonesia is not a good neibours canot see singapores prosper
"i really want go to singapore, but after arrival in indonesia have to quarantine 7 days. it is not worth it for cost 😔🥲"
great! more to come.
its very understanding why indonesia still close its border to singapore cause singapore case still higher then indonesia
because singapore no respect to indonesian
more tests more cases. no test no case.
singapore fast becoming the second india.

a rapid resurgence in s.korea n extended social distancing curbs. open up vtl is a stroke of genius.  singapore next target 20k cases
people south korea already don't look at cases. here in singapore here kpkb about cases.

"next up, korea!"
im pretty sure south korea is having second thoughts now with covid cases hitting 5000 a day.

why forgein workers required 14 day quarantine?
"the vaccination rate in south korea is pretty high (about 56%) as compared to the countries of the foreign workers. again, i am not sure what you mean by 'foreign workers'. do you mean manual labour and other non-expat people? if so. most of the 'foreign workers' in singapore comes from south asia (like india and bangladesh) and other parts of south east asia (e.g. the philippines). the vaccination rates in those countries are generally pretty low (india is about 18%, bangladesh about 11%, and philippines is about 22%). also, south korea has consistently been one of the countries that managed to contain covid. this probably explains why the treatment for them is different as based on the risk level."

previously singapore had zero cases as well so it is not impossible for taiwan cases to be increased in future as covid will be around.
"we now having art,  swabs 2 time per week,   increasing covid cases....l think not save to travel taiwan , china n hk ,  don""t believe them...hiding facts..."
why korea want open travel with singapore with high covid case?
it's calculated move ... so singapore is safe in foreigners' 👀
because we're higher
a rapid resurgence in s.korea n extended social distancing curbs. open up vtl is a stroke of genius.  next target  for singapore 20k cases

"for opening of gurantine free land vtl, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
they're not unvaccinated. they are god's perfect creation.

yeah sometimes we dont appreciate what we have xd
"he did choose the most expensive one though, normal price is about 60-80 euro, or 95-140 singapored"
"its only that expensive at the airport. changi airport pcr tests cost $169 per person. where is this ""$10"" you are talking about?"
pcr tests are not $10 in singapore. it is only $10 if you're sick.
"actually pcr tests in germany are free if there's suspected contact or symtoms. only those compulsory to enter certain venues (where lateral flow rapid tests don't suffice) may be billed, but usually they're &lt;€40 w/o subsidies. but of course the results come back in days unless you pay the markup. urban germany (such as munich) isn't really behind singapore apart from deployment of some basic utilities (such as internet - but much less so than other cities), so why should singapore be so much cheaper if it was actually the same thing?"
"i travelled to munich in may, then there is free of cost at the munich airport. also there are many places where you can tested for free."
now advertise for sia right
"i just got vaccinated, but have a high fever because of it. can i still travel?"

"about money again.  make people pay for the more expensive air tickets when they could just drive across the causeway. vaccinated pilots will fly the planes, right?"
when can singapore open the lane with indonesia because there are also many singaporean who are separated with their indonesian family since the covid started.....can our government also consider our indonesian side
good. cant wait to leave this covid infested nation.
both governments should reconsider restoring the rgl travel arrangement via the land crossings. this is to allow  singapore business owners to visit their facilities in johore and settle outstanding operational and administrative matters there.
well those going there to get yourself burial 🪦 by all means
how about singapore and jb? will open also? or just between singapore and kl only?

"this is why we must never trust “authorities” to break the law in times of an emergency, for they will surely create an emergency in order to break the law. and once we have lost our personal sovereignty, we will never get it back. give them an inch and they’ll take a mile. if the totalitarian tiptoe is not stopped dead in its tracks, the people are inevitably robbed of all civil liberties and inalienable god-given human rights. furthermore, tyrants, who are psychopathic by definition, take advantage of the fact that most souls are inherently good-hearted and trusting of authority."
"singapore government is doing a mess to the country, malaysia cases not stable yet why let them in and quarantine free some more!!! and don't be stupid to open the land transport for malaysia too.  can't imagine malaysia motorcycle coming in !!! makings so much noise again and bad air pollution to singapore!!! 😡😡😡"
meanwhile singapore cases the highest in asean per capita. consistantly the worse in asean both at the beginning and now nearing the end.
this move is only a welcome to those working here to go home to malaysia to family especially elderly parents.  but a mandatory 10-14 days quarantine must be part of the regimen when they come back to singapore to resume their employment.  the risk is too high with just a rapid test for covid.  singaporeans deserve to have a peace of mind.  with continual imported covid daily.  the community is always at risk especially the elderly.  even when they don’t go out n let their adult children do their shopping n stuff.  the data is clear that age 20-50 are the ones getting infected easily thus passing it to the elderly.
another good move to spread virus

yes. so is the hospital business.

"in a society , there will always have criminals . sometime government need to release some criminal so people will get worried . so i order to help us the good government need to put cctv to scrutinised “ the bad persons “ .  there is a phrase called “ the secondary gains from covid “ , many people benefitted from covid or a way to cover shortcoming and weakness . it won’t solve so fast as they hide the enjoyment in the process ."

pease allow cars to drive in to malaysia.
don't hate covid. understand that the virus has nothing to do with setting stupid restrictions.
if continue to be not serious the why it’s taking such a long time to open the causeway but open vtl for all other countries?
"offer your little ones.  i can barely keep thy hands to myself. i'll touch them as i please.  its his body... but its alright.  not like he can fend for himself. she'll be forced into a corner. its her body... but never really her choice.  rapists, child molesters, ... what difference does it make?  they're all in the same league."
serial rapist      : bet you can't force yourself on people & violate them against their will. child molester   : bet you can't inappropriately touch 10 underage kids. mmtf                 : hold my beer - i got this.

"90% vaccinated and 60% boosted. record breaking positive cases. death rate is back to square one (we thought by vaccination and boosters we could protect them). and now easing of restrictions, allowing the spread. most importantly, allowing immune escape. immune escape induces mutations, and oh we have to get jabbed with boosters again. moderna please, we need your help."
i wouldnt be surprised if they later tell us get 4th shot hahaha then 5th then 6th and so on. first say 1 shot then 2 then booster later say need one more booster
anyone who refuses the booster are now labeled an anti-vaxx even though they had just taken 2 shots 6 months ago. anyone can become an unvaxxed anytime any day.
singapore is home for real singaporeans not foreigners and not for fake singaporeans .
not fit for the job find replacement whatever they coming up with it’s not making sense and is not helping us in anyway.
another name for singapore is endiapore or sin  city .
"'most cases are mild' indeed, this as been the case since the start of the pandemic, regardless of variant, vaxxed or not so its a rather irrelevant point. they keep saying its within their expectation as if they let it spread only to prata later on when it goes out of control."
"ever since the start of the global vaccine rollout in january 2021, some experts have been crying out against mass and rapid vaccination of populations in the midst of a raging pandemic. if they are right, this will go on creating more variants and prolonging the pandemic. so far, it is looking like it, and god help us! thank you cna for this report and with this song of hope i pray for god's swift intervention to end this pandemic: https://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbghttps://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbg"
is it true that after 25 feb can go outside maskless?
braless and pantyless but must wear mask at all times
but everyone just watch when temperature change and what the in built immunity from the not so severe omicron will do. from then they will be seen by the citizens in totally different light!   with the salary they taking we can employ around 6 times the number of leaders to serve the nation. we expect better results honestly!
set up modena here to use singapore children as test subjects next? tip for them: mandate weekly booster jabs for innocent singaporeans  then every week billions of profit!
anticipated your own failures ??
i hate covid! i hate covid! i hate covid! i hate covid! i hate covid!🤬😾😠😡🤮💢💔🤦
don't hate covid. understand that the virus is not responsible for making everyone suffer.
israel has cancelled all restrictions including vtl lines. what is singapore still doing now ? looking backwards to continue to stay in the dark ?
"until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them, this drama will continue. the disease isn't that severe as projected by the media. they are trying to create the social credit system by fooling the people in name of covid. social credit system is the ultimate slavery. every person will be assigned credits. people with low credits will be refused access to shops, malls.. etc. you see.. in emerging set up where people are granted access based on vaccine status,  they will soon replace the vaccine status with credits. so basically if a politician wants to commit atrocity and you oppose it. he can easily isolate you from the society by lowering your credits. imagine the power that you are handing over to the politicians because of your stupidity. still think it's all about the virus??? 🤦"
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere the world. god bless singapore.
now even let moderna to set up a base here. clap foryouah. 👏
"talk so much yet still don't allow those unvaccinated to go back to their previous work. just continue flipping prata ya, ministers."
just wear sign saying unbaccinated and welcome tourists ask for a meal lol
"just ask those sheeple to take 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th shots lah. come out so many useless rules and pattern for what?"
cant wait to get covid19. where to get it ah?
"want to travel bubble. might as well, don't wear facemask as well lar. so troublesome"
"in the time like these, when the omicron surges the singapore government wanted to increase the gst. then the bloody art test kits will go up. then those patients who are vulnerable have to pay the hospital bills will go up. and keep getting covid-19 over and over  again to see a gp with increasing gst. how to bloody cope!  economy will go down. i don't really understand why they still bring in foreigners? did you do a check at the domiteries? last delta virus infections is at jurong domitories. so who is the one still having covid-19 positives??? is either someone botch up to take the art test not knowing he is positive. and spreads the virus around. or somebody coming back from overseas getting negative then got positive the next days spread the virus around. or some idiots violate the qurantine, or some bastards from the domitory creating clusters. or they wanted to collect all the variants of covid-19 samples to an organisation that you know who. if your ship is sinking with many holes. you only plug one hole but the ship still sinking. you know like seeing wily coyote cartoon. game over for us. firstly once you get infected regardless you are vaccinated. how can you tell what variants of covid-19 you have and how much the virus have been done to your body. you can't even tell from there. so  the doctor have to sent you for x-ray! how much damage the virus have been done to your body! is unknown. even your are negative when taking the art test you still having flu like symptoms that you still not fully recovered. and if one of family in the house are positive, the rest of the family refuse to check   the art test whether they get the covid-19 or not and even though they have no symptoms! still game over to you. it will keep increasing. the self collect art test kit can only take once with only 3 art test kit.and if you still running out art test kit, you can't go out and buy art test kit at the phamarcies because you are still positive for covid-19. look, you cannot get more from the self collect vendor machine any more because you can get only once!!!! how are we going to out when we are running out of art test kit. but your trace together are locked down that you cannot violate buying more art test kits. if i stay alone in the house with no other family to help me. the other problems is you still not recovered but then you are negative that you need to see a gp when you see a doctor when you have so many people with positive and i will risk getting back positive again. why can't extend getting more medicne from the telemedicine without risking ourselves getting positive again!!!!"
"20,000 cases in one day! must be the toto hong bao draw cases showing up."

"after this waves, lift all restrictions immediately.   bunch of overpaid clowns.   already 520000 cases, most likely over a millions with people that dunno or not declared.    92% fully vaccinated,  your expectation are what before we can have a normal life again.   99.7% have no or mild symptoms.   same numbers as flu, we never requested anything before for flu.  ..."
"do we have irrefutable evidence that the mildness of omicron wave is primarily due to vaccination, not because the variant itself is simply mild enough to confer immunity and not cause severe illness?  if not, we should not attribute the mildness of this variant to being vaccinated, and therefore, continue with the vaccine mandate? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_cvfij3qrq&t=551shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_cvfij3qrq&t=551s"
stop forcing us to take singapore airlines to save your investment. just open the bloody borders

"i am seriously worried what kind of country this is becoming and how my children's gonna grow up well in this country! my kid even asked me, is there no more democratic society as what they say in the singapore pledge?"
yup no more the world is fully dead humans are dead
unless we stand up together and push back these mandates and dictatorship.

means don’t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
"vaccination status for citizens will expire after 270 from 2nd dose without booster. how about tourists? it seems that even if they only had 2 doses more than 270 days ago, they can still come to singapore and be counted as ""vaccinated"" for 30 days from arrival. why the double standard against citizens? this is a question and not a statement of fact, happy to be corrected if i am wrong."
means don’t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
interesting question will be good to have an answer
"wills based on ica's faqs that are currently online, i'm pretty sure what the answer is, but worded my qn carefully given our laws..."
what’s new lol
"bi han i don't see any outrage about this. need more awareness. they've changed their position on covid policies many times before, if there's enough outrage this can change too."
lies again? cobra viper
"friday, february 11, 2022: (our lady of lourdes) our lady said: “my dear children, you are aware that i revealed to bernadette in apparition that i am the immaculate conception. this means that by the grace of god i did not have original sin because i was free of the effects of adam’s sin, so i could be a perfect tabernacle for carrying my son, jesus. at the time of this apparition, the church had not declared this as a dogma to believe, but now it is. i had no sin during life by the grace of god as well. this is why my immaculate heart and the sacred heart of my son, jesus are joined as one. miracles of healing have come from people who bathed in the waters of the grotto of lourdes for those who believe in the miracles of jesus. give glory and thanks to my son, jesus, for bestowing all of this healing on the people.” jesus said: “my people, many of you have been brain washed to believe that the covid shots and boosters are good for you. the truth is that each shot you take with graphene oxide in it, is making your immune system worse to the point that any infection could kill you. after three shots you could lose up to 80% of your immune system. the left evil ones are taking a page out of the communists’ play book. if they keep telling you a lie about taking covid shots long enough, you will begin to believe the lie. but this is not the truth no matter how many times you hear this lie, it is still a lie. your doctors and media people, who are pushing this lie, will be punished severely for killing people, and not using ivermectin to heal people. when the truth is revealed, the covid shot promoters will be put in jail for crimes against humanity. the evil ones will side with the antichrist, and they will all be cast into hell in the end. my faithful believers will be healed at my refuges, and they will see my reward in my era of peace.”"

tourist are the main agent that bring in the virus variant of concern in the first place. we only hope that the virus don't mutate further to prolonged the agony especially in countries with bigger population and larger land mass and whose citizens are not fully vaccinated.
angelofmusic477 yet seems that they are subject to less stringent restrictions than citizens. doesn't make sense to me...
cats choose it make sense if you put $$$ first and ignore w.h.o. advices.
hk is about to ban vtl from singapore airlines. wait for it.
1 in 10 recovered covid-19 patients in suffers persistent symptoms six months after infection: you think infected by it we are stronger? few of my friends and relatives after recovered still feeling weak after 2 months. those recovered might start to feel tht the body are no longer strong as before esp heart. please take care folks and dont mess around. its too early to know what happen next.
disingaporeusted the way the govt is handling this matter. these are lives of singaporean at stake and you guys are relaxing measures.
could always move to uk it's very nice here.  more freedom than america.
"now is like telling everyone ,get ready to be infected andyouwill have antibody"
"looks like it. cannot say, <i>go out and get infected, it might do you good,</i> because some people may die. so, although know that infection rate are going to skyrocket, no extra stringent measures are taken to reduce it further. more people get omicron and recover the better the better it is for <b>herd immunity</b> ."
got covid means greater protection so why need 3rd jab?
"you know, you think they don't know. they cannot say, and sabo themselves."
pfizer ceo said two jab is limited protection
"terry andrews  first shot, the vaccine is new to the body, therefore the effectiveness is not lasting. like new soldiers not very experienced in war. the full flu vaccine can last for about six months. old soldiers they fight longer. at the tail end, the effectiveness not so high. that's why about five months recommend booster shots."
thulomanchay and then?
thulomanchay how many years need boosters?
"wake up, look at hk healthcare collapsing because their vaccination rate for old people is low. look at their cases compare to ours! if you manage to convince people not to take 3rd one. you could potentially cause people to die!"
"vincent wong quit imposing your choices onto others, you fascist. covid and omicron are responsible for 'killing' people. don't push the blame to the unvaxxed just because you depend on others to be vaxxed so that you can be safe."
"lol no mask, no mask, no mask. no mask, then the last guy wear mask soooo rule apply to others but not to the big 4?"
i from myanmar. singapore government actually  good on their the public.
😇
"japan is the latest country to face the omicron paradox as infections soar but serious illness proportionally declines. it is a challenge for a country that has dodged the worst of the coronavirus, leaving japanese officials scrambling to catch up even as some restrictions are being scaled back. japan is now seeing caseloads soar to record levels. the latest figures show an average of 76,800 new cases each day, double the number from two weeks ago and up from less than 1,000 new cases each day at the start of the year. this is pushing up hospital admissions even as a record 264,000 people nationwide are being told to recover at home. in tokyo, the covid-19 hospitalization rate is just below the 50 percent benchmark for declaring a full state of emergency, although the occupancy rate for wards housing the most critical cases is less than 5 percent."
"new zealand omicron wave likely to peak in march with up to 30,000 cases a day, says  jacinda ardern, pime minister of new zealand. prime minister says number of people who get booster vaccines will dictate how high the peak will be. jacinda ardern told rnz, the national radio broadcaster, that she expected new zealand’s cases to peak at between 10,000 and 30,000 cases a day. nearly 67% of 5+ million new zealand’s total population, including children, have received a booster shot; 83% have had at least one dose, and 77% two doses. among the population aged 12 and over, 94% of new zealanders are vaccinated with two doses – but rates are lagging among māori, 86% of whom are double-vaccinated. while the vast majority of the country is vaccinated, some new zealanders continue to object to vaccination, particularly the mandates that affect about 40% of the workforce. new zealand’s high vaccination rates mean some people may not have any symptoms at all. the danger here is that they will still be able to pass on the virus to someone else. the home self-isolation period for cases reduces from 14 days to 10 days, and for contacts from 10 days to seven. the period of self isolation also applies to household members. ""we have seen that 90 percent of household contacts who were going to test positive do so within those first 10 days,"" with omicron, she says, so there are good reasons for the changes. she advises people to develop a home self-isolation plan, including identifying a buddy who can drop off supplies. ardern says the way to handle this omicron period will be the same as previous times - test, vaccinate and isolate if sick."
"south korea on wednesday (feb 16) reported a daily record of 90,443 new omicron cases, as numbers nearly doubled within a week amid the spread of the highly infectious omicron variant. south korean authorities have shifted testing and tracing policy, in line with the less fatal omicron variant's spread, toward self-monitoring and diagnosis and at-home treatment starting this month ( february 2022)."
too many short forms!!!!! speak english please
"please clearly define who qualifies as a vaccinated traveller? in singapore, vaccinated persons are those who have completed their second dose (for mrna) after 14days and, where due, those who have taken their boosters within 9 months from the date of the second dose (different consideration for non mrna vaccines). if other countries do not follow singapore standards (meaning the travellers do not follow singapore way of classifying vaccinated status), are they still allowed to enter singapore as vaccinated traveller? in short, those who take 2 doses of non mrna, persons who do not take boosters after 9mths of their second doses etc. because these visitors should be classified as non-vaccinated. how will or can the authorities validate the vaccination status of visitors?"
"from what is currently stated on ica website, my understanding is that tourists only need 2 mrna jabs, even if they were taken more than 270 days ago, they will still be allowed and receive ""vaccinated"" status for 30 days."
what if they are fake?
"very rational approach targeting the areas that really matter. more important than total number of cases is the number of severe cases (because icus, deaths, healthcare system strain). this is being handled. the other important thing is allowing ""freedom"" in areas (ie, among people who) where there is little to negligible effect, so that quality life and productivity can be ensured. both goals are well managed. i rather have these metrics as indicators to determine when/how to change these measures, than say a prime minister party scandal as the determinant factor in the easing of covid."
with high vaccinations rate and possibly 1.5m people get infected then singapore situation will go to new normal.
all will get infected
stinkapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may (no masks & no safeentry check in) since uk has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in us the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination 🥳 and this is called political science 🤓 not science 🤣
neocov
so if social distancing then don’t need mask ah?
now i wish for another virus to come along 🙏🏼

most effective measures but no early treatment? fail.
looks like we are running out of solution.!
what will the government do to handle the influx of vaccine injuries?
🇸🇬 ecosam spray-guns & disinfectant-cleaners
people must be more flexible to adapt to the new rules if there is new variant appeared.  this is important to make sure health care system is not overwhelmed.
each country has its own unique situation .. singapore has a high population density. and should not be compared with sweden or finland in this fight against this pandemic.
"go to the neighbourhood park.  the park seem to be a no mask zone. yea, while exercising not need to put on mask. sure. its more like strolling in the park prevents covid infections."
more vtls on the way - that's a very capable s'pore govt. 👍👍
they want to open up make co vid as flu n normal
useless
still talking. singapore is heading for big trouble. who should send a teams to investigate usa fort detrick lab. unit 731
ccp of china still owes the world a answer as to what happen at wuhan lab in 2020.
"why got hrw, i still cannot get my art? i mean if the reason i cannot take my art is because i have recovered from covid. then does that mean i do not need to submit my test result to moh during this period? if i need to submit my result then shouldn’t i get my art from my machine as well? i don’t understand why so troublesome."
moh sent me a health risk warning. what does that mean. i called up moh to verify. got very little help. i asked if they could verify its frm moh and what does this mean. health risk. no word of close contact!  i have to send in that days art result through their online forms. forms request name and other particulars. i asked the staff is the messingapore genuine? now with all the scams and phishing ! no help at all. i was told to go online search for art go where kiosks. if i am able to get my 2 kits means its a genuine messingapore frm moh!   i was flabbergasted!  surely they have a database. i was checking my own case not someone elses!  not very good answer to give anyone. !  i am still unhappy
more ppl dying
there will be more death & infection in near future. boh luck liao ❌️8❌️ 😂😂😂 govt is not god. keep that in mind
13 deaths. best doctors also cannot save. jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything.
"malaysia got 20k cases, and singapore so tiny yet we have 16k cases?! 🤭"
and we  still  have  to wear mask  here. or  else  kena saman.
"all vaccines are "" safe n effective  "" yeah rite still pushing mrna for kids n boosters  is total utter stupidity. "" risk of myocarditis following mrna covid vaccination is around 133 times greater "" source isreal national news 27 jan '22"
singapore is more densely populated than malaysia
please stop the 10.30pm rule
mmtf is just plain waste time rubbish 🗑 this one has failed miserably. singaporean needs a change now. with real doctor's & professors in mmtf. the wayang shows have to come to an end now.
liang po po  prata rules😁
🤣😂🤣😂
why worried at work place if all fully vaccinated if got it mild or no symptom 😴
"it's more than 2 years and the government globally still struggling and finding solutions to the virus. most people couldn't care less and immune to the various restrictions(changing very now and then) set by the task force. the populations is looking up to them to contain the virus if not eradicated it. how can you stopped it, ironically creating the virus problems everyday by importing the virus into the country? shouldn't we nipped the virus at its source? till thy kingdom cometh, they can never solve the virus if they continue creating the problems.  to be fair, they are in a dilemma,  on one hand trying to revive the economy and closing the border to prevent the virus coming in. honestly i couldn't care much, it has been a long time since the virus has infected the whole world. many has died and infected. the virus will stay with us for many more years because many unknown about the virus is still there."
why so concern health care just open up soon all  will got it and soon we all going to die too😁
"the task words are gospel no matter how much you suggest, they will not listen.  there are still many unknown about the virus. your guess is good as mine. everytime when we think we have the solutions, the virus circumvent it.  everyone of us, no matter how many times we were vaccinated may still get infected. if our body can take it, then it is ok whether vaccinated or not. otherwise we may lose our lives regardless whether vaccinated or not. if having underlying health problems, the result may be worst and cost us our lives. it is really depends on each individual whether his body can take it or not regardless vaccinated or not. it is the science that vaccinated has more chance to survive than those unvaccinated."
i get my information from youtube. where does the task force get their information?
"lord of the ring,tai chi master where is liang po po? just open all  border just stop talking cock got it just mild or no symptom for fully vacinated person why need the test 😁"
wait wait wait. travelers can now go to the mall to take art within 24 hrs?

why?

singapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may (no masks & no safeentry check in) since uk has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in us the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination 🥳 and this is called political science 🤓 not science 🤣

where are those guys who praised hk zero covid policy against our very own govt for flip floppings? these people must be damn sad to see hk in this stage. poor management. no beds left in hospitals.  we are very lucky to have such capable task force. thank you  mtf

is there a system in place to verify the result of a art self testing ? seems to me a tourist can just report a negative test result using the app without even taking the test. i have just looked at an art test i took at home last night and there are no unique identifying features on the test strip.
it's supervised on site

jeremy ko thanks for pointing that out. they must have changed it recently. now all i have to do it wait until malaysia opens or just have a short singapore trip.
this useless mtf think our body is like a plate of rojak!! got natural immunity still take jab for what.
we open border when the cases of countries are high. hk record cases. sinkies record cases. i bet the economy is going to collapse in less than 6 mth time.
jeremy ko actually....before they dropped the daily testing it was supervised on days 2 & 7 ( i think ) and unsupervised on the other days. it was the unsupervised testing i was curious about regarding verification.
"the initial reason they gave on why covid was supposedly so ""deadly"" was because it goes undetected.  if the virus is detectable, the ""deadliness"" of this virus would become a joke, like the mmtf.  the test kit is prob a mult-million dollar project assigned to their own to justify covid expense.  just like the tracetogether token."

what we know they are highly paid newscasters. 😂
alzario  are you jealous?
justfair cant accept the facts.?😂
alzario  they are deserving of what they earn. they can earn more outside politics. get this right
"justfair really?  allowing travellers coming in without strict rules. put the blame on the locals for the increase on infection rate? call that a brilliant idea? how much we earn, it's our line of work that we have chosen. any decision made which may lead to jeopardize others safety is no excuse to cover up our own failure. get that right. 🤔"
"controls are all nonsense.  just open up and return to normal.  look to sweden, which shows that no controls were just fine."
"sweden cases 2.41m +11,751 deaths 16,579 +78 ok lah. a big country such as sweden already have that kind of figure, dense singapore can have all infected and at least 250,000 deaths without control and you are actually ok about it knowing that 1 out of 5 people you know passed away?"
viking ignore all these trolls and kids.
viking this same group of trolls  would complain if no restrictions in place and thousands of deaths if out of control
viking what good does it presents with spewing loads of numbers to convince people that how bad or how good is the situation of one country over another ? basically sweden gov is agreeing with its own citizens that it doesn't make much sense continue with all those restrictions anymore. and singapore with even higher vaçcination rate yet squeamishly holding up is a reflection on their lack of trust to the experimental jab.
3 stooges in charge
loser ? get a life. grow up. we are doing very well as a country.
no beds left in hk. 4200 cases today. many serious. give thanks to our task force

that's going to be a great opportunity for hk to scrap its groundless so-called dynamic zero policy and reopen its borders to vaccinated singapore travellers

re: help ! sorry guys side tracked abit. how to go johor now ? vtl lane is what ar?
"look so cumbersome and time consuming. not practical at all. actually, custom only need to ensure 3 things. 1） must have vaccination certificate. 2） maintain safe distancing while inside the bus + crossing custom. 3） wear face masks throughout.  all other requirements such as pre-travel on-line application, long term pass, prep test are all unnecessary."
yes there is just too much unnecessary paperwork and predeparture testing involved. at least it's only a rat on arrival instead of losing 1/2 a day+ waiting for pcr result.
"first vtl, first omicron transmission in one of the worst disciplined countries when it comes to covid. thanks singapore."

last friday we show the black friday for wall street. this was a rigged and planned event. s aficia reported the omicron variant on 24 nov. wednesday.  thursday was thanks giving.  white house needs the oil price to goes down but opec refused to cooperate. 50 million nation reserves will be use but mkt did not respond.  white house saw this as an opportunity.  gang up the media and wall street.  media immediately cooked and spice up the omicron variant without any facts. scientists need 14 days to determine whether current vaccine works. media outlets were all jumping into the waggon from thursday and friday.  market nose dive once market open. down 900 points. crude oil down $10. white house happy. wall street happy to cool down heated market. fed happy as the pressure to taper off is release. media outlets journalists got their bonus for the successful scam

it's  possible to produce superior performance provided you do something different from the majority.  however most of us tend to pay more attention to the shiniest position  in the market cost of proper diversification

it is wonderful and more win for malaysia  that malaysia to open up soon for singaporeans to go in to enjoy the beauty of malaysia.
"what is good in malaysia??? food cooked with the cheap oil to offer best return for s$~ there is a saying: to know the tastiest stall in malaysia = take note of where the rats are, hotel must be new, if not poor maintenance n full of cockroaches, buy branded products that is “copyright fake”- can’t even buy a branded perfume n don’t know if it is a fake. car accident at your own cost because singapore insurance not covered there, amongst the crazy malaysian drivers. only people who wants “cheap n cheaper” goes to malaysia n enjoy s$1-rm3 exchange. but what’s the fuss - all the best seafood catch is exported to singapore for best prices. malaysia serves you there with 2nd or 3rd grade ingredients; take it tasty add more msingapore,chilli,salt n more oil= mostly probably palm oil. eat more n die faster. is there cheap and good??? what is cheap is more likely no good; as there is always a hidden cost."
"keep the border close infinitely; keep singapore monies within singapore to help our own smes n fnb first. also avert any covid19 brought back uprising. when did johor/malaysia help singapore??? always give us problems of water supply, aeroplane flyover borders, rail hsr contract cancellation- worst is the marine intrusion into tuas singapore territorial water, wanting singapore to make war. bad poor neighbour."
true that
close the border
"don't go there lah, all robbers and unemployed waiting"
i think city square now become kampung sqaure
shopping  also  anywhere  nices  places  miss fam✌ important  visiting
johor is not singapore problem. its malaysian leaders incompetence that they didn't do anything for their state  and johor business  just rely on singaporeans
singaporean need malaysia to work hahahha
sounds like malaysia needing singapore always
singapore not to open the border malaysia case are very high
in reality this is the least priority for both governments. a state cannot just make businesses cater to only one country. why locals do not go to these businesses to spend. ask yourselves. it was designed in the beginning for tourist only. spending power. get it.
"going back to the old ways. ask the variant for permission first. tourism , the variant do not like unless there is a cure"
there was this circulating message warning singapore not to visit jb as their robbers are waiting
good lah hope singaporean known don't bring any pademic covid19 back to s'pore ..and also increase all good in malaysia..
做么酱的？about:invalid#zcsafez
"if i am not mistaken, its malaysia that closes the causeway within 24 hrs just after singapore announces that they will not close them because it affects many people."
80% singaporean give business to malaysia wow unbelievable than what happen to malaysian people
just johor bahru.. not whole malaysia
sweetkiller xx johor also consider big as singapore don't tell 11 states of malaysia don't travel to jb shopping
residentgood bruh johor 3 times the size of singapore.. anyway can't deny that m'sia a good place to bargain for food and leisure..
those eateries half full because of we're still in this pandemic la omg. if vtl fully open do you really want these places to become fully packed and crowded? vtl open = no more covid for you?
"all countries  should seek damage  and compensation  from source of  origin  of wuhan viruses.  no benefits  on dealing cw mainland chinese,  only miisery and menace  from the communists n its revile officials."
very true...
jb robbers waiting for rich  singaporeans to rob
"rob what, now all going cashless"
"a bit bias .... from my first person experience... only town area are impact the most and still not recover yet. just slightly away from jb center, tebrau area such as johor jaya, molek , mount austin, taman daya ... t skudai area... kulai jaya... especially premium outlets...they are back to normal."
we scare jb robbers are rubbing their hands waiting to rob...
exactly
lol
crime rate is very high in jb
"this is nothing new, the same is also happening at the malaysia-thailand border towns such as haadyai, sadao, satun etc which relied heavily on malaysian tourists."
"no offence....in away i agreed & disagreed with u....there is concerned for johor ppl, opening up the land vtl.(there is a difference my & thai border) the faster & increase in number of ppl travelling jb-singapore, this means small biz in jb, can start to earn singapored's. if land vtl more relax or go back to pre covid, it will benefit both. but the biggest concern for me, is safety. i personally, witness a day light robbery, a few years back ,when i was in jb. it happened just across the street. although i look forward to the borders opening, i will still hold back awhile, before i visit jb."
but they are covering the johor-singapore border. majority of singaporean's and johoreans don't give af about what happened at the malaysia-thailand borders. maybe you should start a news coverage about the malaysia-thailand borders
singaporean are not welcome by many johorean.
"yeah, not welcome but people, businesses and even politicians begging singaporeans to go back."
they like singapore money not singaporean..... 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
nothing new..money talks. in thailand it’s no money..no honey.
singaporean like malaysian currency too
it cuts both ways. singaporeans loves to shop and dine in jb not out of love. rather baecause of attractive exchange rates
singaporean or malaysian both like $$$😂
not like we like malaysians anyway...hahahaha
tourism is far from happening; maybe 2025
there won't be any economy left if they remain closed forever so dont think so
"the jb business owners relying on singaporean for sustainability are not aware that they've crossed the bridge of no return. the world that they knew it, is already over. their businesses are standing right at the doorway of the graveyard waiting to be buried."
exactly
"this cyclical border shutdown, lockdown and booster shots was planned by the cabals to goes on for many years to come. it will only end through war, regime change, worldwide terrorist attack and civil unrest. and, the masses can create this climate just by using their thoughts energy for the transformation to take effect."
"in all honesty, i more familiar with the roads in jb than the roads in jurong. now that this vtl is back, people may simply start renting and prepping for when singaporean can cross back to normal."
aim for that to happen in 2095.
for singapore cars to drive to malaysia.. i dun think it will happen before cny..
tse hong ling ur quite optimistic
"mrboliao98 yes, look on the bright side.. at least still alive...still employed..and the internet still lets you connect to the world virtually, you can still ""travel"" to other countries by just ""walking ard"" the streets of usa of uk from google earth.. lol life's little happiness.."
tse hong ling i have planned to do that in the last 10 years but didn't put into motion. i did a bit on nyc and their universal studios
missing those bouncing cars at petrol stations..😂

of course man !!!!!! since 2020 march during the covid-19 pandemic 😷 virus 🦠 everything is on the lockdown till today. to be able to travel 🧳 back home to you kampong in malaysia 🇲🇾 where you lost touch with your family members and loved 🥰 ones is very much treasured nonetheless. nothing means more to malaysians especially when it comes to family knits. unlike the ugly and stinky culture in worthless red dot 🔴 majulah kita singapura 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬 🏝 cold 🥶 and without love 💕 and compassionate too.

new variant omicron is arriving it can be only bring in by the vaccinated from the airport. unvaccinate cannot enter 😏
"wow ! on 1st day already detected on arrival positive case. all the traveler are in the end are stay home quarantine? speechless .... closed or opened also suffering somemore the ""o""micron is coming very soon."
"the new variant is omicron, not micron, right?"
alamak it’s omicron ok 👍 deadlier than delta variant ok 👍 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
albert pang its premature to say its deadly. data currently do not suggest its deadlier then delta yet. may be a blessing in disingaporeuise if it can help to eradicate delta but is less deadly.
speed train please 😘
"at last home sweet home  l""m so so happy for them to be united with families and their love one, there is nothing like to be home  at last to celebrate the happy moment together again. there is no best place like home"
bad news indeed.omicron virus.vaccination done but looks like we'll be on the hit list of new vaccines trails again which will be the never ending story.
singapore is heading for big trouble. vtl with malaysia must be stop. stop. stop. their government and its citizens always say that turn of the tap. high risk.
how come ban become bar for the japan news
congratulation umno.👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
what has umno got to do with this vtl?
i dislike st comment section because it has been infected with dangerous virus worst than covid.👎👎👎👎👎
newborn is now  2 years old
please go take the vaccine shot! thank you!
"the notice still say ""digital meet-the-people session (from 26 sep 2021 till further notice)"", siam of what? expecting all the elderly and people with problems to be tech savvy? what the h. i think all the ministers should resume the mtps and personally face to face serve their ""fully vaccinatted"" residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face-to-face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october."
"so, let's give you a figure of measure so that you can understand the situation better; from 23 oct to 28 nov alone [ref moh updates] children 0-11 years old = 8,177 infected children 12-19 years old = 3,663 infected total infected children is 11,840 numbers"
"while they practice safety by avoidance, singaporeans have to face the risks?"
"as i have said multiples of times before; vaccination should never have been used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. stop the imports from higher-risk countries and the leaks into the communities. safe guard the life-safety of all singaporeans, particularly the younger ones, elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority."
"so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans [for you, with you] if you will have to accept daily c19 deaths and thousands community infection? for it is not a solution. the question is when will it reach you or our family members.?"
he has proven to be a man of mettle. the whole of singapore should rally behind lky in his noble quest for his glory and the glory of singapore
grace lim lky...g.o.a.t.
peter chew he had  beaten china no1 and japan  no1. and malaysia no1.  he is young and handsome. should be singapore idol.
"no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine. it's simply illogical in the context of citizens life-safeties. single party is unwise and dangerous."
question: what is the meaning of toto defense when elderly have to fall just to benefit a certain $group$?
politics 101: 'talking about mitigating' but not doing so is merely an excuse to avoid future blame.single party is unwise and dangerous.
hey ttkoh123 howyouknow so much info?
"would we be in such a situation if they were the real experts? nowadays, it's difficult to trust anything they say."
"discrimination policy does not work, when we can see that all 15 deaths are fully vaccinated seniors."
hello .....how about philippines🇵🇭 can we travel to singapore🇸🇬 now? we are fully vaccinated...my husband and me....just asking.....thank you very much
what’s so great about millennium red dot 🔴 singapore 🇸🇬 after all ??????????????????????? 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤗
"so selfish of those traveller coming in to singapore and out bringing virus to us and your own country!!! never used brain to think!! should not travel during this time!!! you feel happy when you travel if get infected do you think worth it!!! very selfish of the government because of money,  taking your countrymen life in risk!!!"
hit the like button if you are vaccinated ☺️
the vtl portal does not work. it does not read nor accept proof of vaccination from usl. i am unable to get vtl approval from usa. load of bullshit nonsense
it is incredibly short-sighted to be going on overseas tour  right now !
it's been 2 years. we need to start travelling again.

home recovery is now the norm. if you get infected you will be sent home
"please return my money when i paid for quarantine last time,,,why make me quarantine n now no need,,pay me back my hard earn money"
i hope that travellers continue to take extra precautions when they travel overseas under the vaccinated travel lanes. 🙏
"covid|9 is accumulative and permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to replicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated.  covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant."
"i don't think these cleaners pay attention to the cleaning protocol mentioned in this video. at the hawker centres, you can either see many uncleaned tables or cleaners used the same cloth to clean the tables."
who pay for the covid test kits for school children? not every family is as rich as those highly paid individuals.
singapore is now classified as a high risk country by who. why? too eager with open arms in welcoming foreign spreaders?
"most welcome your 💰 to boost economy. enjoy at own risk, keep safe with mask on. singapore is a “fine” city!"
avtls are also expanded to include theyous. its citizens are warned against travel to the city state due to very high level of covid-19.
listening to harianto speak english is like listening to a news broadcast from a third world country.
exactly. it’s painful to hear.
better than the actual third world where you came 😂
"jovi mathews you know where i came from, fool? you can't even form a proper english sentence.  😂"
jovi mathews why so sour? you were harianto's english teacher?  lol
hei this is singapore rojak country's not american copy cat slang ok !🦁
richard wong angmo boot liking 😝
jovi mathews  well done.
nicholas lawrence  can i guess?
open up for vtl - but shut down dining in for singaporean- does it make a difference?
it does. because we will soon have new overseas covid variants.
the govt urge us to stay at home but they let foreigners come into singapore. did they also advise them to stay in hotel and not go out? lol
imported
"stupid tourists. come singapore do what. there is nothing to do! because our government have no balls! our government only know how to penalized their own citizens only. catch food delivery people for illegal parking when they are not obstructing traffic, catch all the petty stuff and doing just half past six efforts to safe their face and economy. bring back sirs! the entire pap cabinet all waive half a year salary can help citizen how much already! resign la oyk, lawrence wong!"
unvaxx ppl in danger.
importing covid-19.
"as of september 27, 6% of uk sequenced tests were new ay.4.2 variant, it could be 10% more transmissible than delta. big warm welcome to ay.4.2 have a nice stay n bring on 20k infections"

"covid|9 has the structure of hiv whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant. covid-vaccine is a obstruction of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine-sulfate"
is singapore not recognising vaccination certificates for tourists entering singapore where they need to undergo the serology test of antibodies?
what’s so great about millennium red dot 🔴 singapore 🇸🇬 island 🏝 anyway ????????????? 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤑🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
all it takes is one kid to go....see if your vtl is still priority!
u are not welcome.youcan stay at the miw bungalows
now is the vaccinated ppl spreading.. 2 vaccinated ppl can go eat & go mall. also can hit nearly 4k !! good job
unvaccinated people can take public transport and sit side by side but they cannot go into malls for grocery shopping. what logic is this?
"irresponsible policy that puts singaporeans at great risk. when the imminent spikes from these foreign virus happen here,  please don't blame the locals for spreading it. and dont use the non vaxxed group as scapegoat.  even the us cdc warned that singapore is a high risk place."

that's it that's all travel at your own risk!! take care of yourself especially your psychological health!! lots of vexed mockers out here!!
it's equal to not saying anything
rs lin the same applies to you. yawn.
thanks. am good with face streaming. thank god my family love me more than government
uk media report today that there is an even more virulent strain of virus circulating in the uk.  doctors are urging heightened measures.  so we'll see how long this vtl scheme continues...

"lisa lim lawrence wong said [26 jul 2021 in parliament] - “as we do so, we must expect cases to rise, partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level. also, as we open our border for people to travel without shn, we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time, but at that stage as you heard just now, [our main focus will no longer be on daily cases] numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus, they are much less likely to become very ill.”  [ note: capitalized words ]  lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there would be leaks from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “risk” because as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore?  and during that time, not many singaporeans were even vaccinated.  to make the matter even worse. mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew.  why must they keep importing from higher risk countries?"

well like that you dont travel forever since so scare.
lisa lim its not about the fear more about the inconvenience.  and in inflationary environment and public health division.. the trends towards intl travel will likely change towards local focused journey..
"lisa lim don't comment like small kids! non ar fear of covid any more but wasting time & money, not gonna make ur life any better! tis is not permanent situation, ifyoucan wait patientlyyouwill find ease & peace but ifyouwanna rush you will regret!"
s suwandi  travelling is not mandatory yet. maybe will debate in parliament first
♠️lovely free soul♠️ waste money is not you to comment as you are not travelling.
bmpcos wow like that also need  debate waste of resouces and time. look if the person need to travel then go ahead. the risk is there but need to take precaution.
lisa lim wat doyoumean by i'm not travelling? who gaveyousuch ideas? why aryouso quick to judge? study the world before commenting!
♠️lovely free soul♠️ i mean is you are the traveller and the mei wu is also not so why say other people waste money. then why quick to judge those who travel now waste money
lisa lim be patients & let things go smoothly rather than rushing & make things worse! i'm on th right page & my words ar strong! soonyoushall see wats happening for those who ar greedy & rushing!
those infected with covid will see long term deterioration of health.
so go to your shell. don't show too much fear here
"4000 daily cases in 5m population is like 1,000,000 daily cases in china 1.3b population by proportion.  singapore is dangerous place to be.  the foreigners will get covid very soon.  some of them will bring in more deadly variants .  travel is stupid wasteful activity.  bad things will happen to all because of greed."
welcome and good luck!!

pls. get your n95 masks and wear them everywhere. moderna is the best vaccine with less negative reactions.
"why expand the vtl-land and then to suddenly suspend all vtl between dec 23-jan 20, 2022 just a few days later?   this reflects poorly on singapore’s leaders in their decision making.   seems like knee jerk reaction rather than fact based rational decisions to me. yes omicron is spreading fast but at the same time there is also evidence that omicron’s impact is less severe than delta,  especially for vaccinated people.    why suddenly pull out vtls?   this causes lots of disruptions to individuals as well as the public’s confidence in the leadership’s ability and resolve in turning covid into an endemic."
"singaporeans shall not take booster until all 3 demands are met. 1. legislation on the maximum number of booster required to be recognized as a fully vaccinated person in singapore(ideally not more than 4). 2. a cash payout of singapored500 for each booster taken as compensation for taking on risk of vaccination. 3. removal of all vaccination differentiated measures in singapore. my fellow singaporeans, join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the pap. to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one, use the 3 finger salute to signal that you are part of this cause. the day when everyone in public openly uses the 3 finger salute, it is time for a revolution. revolution of our times."

its a big joke. widen vtl to include sporeans to enter malaysia. but bas tickets are all sold out till next feburary. in 2022!!!!

lol
"who’s latest update for december 7 showed that all 212 omicron cases documented across 18 european union countries were either mild or without any symptoms at all.  so why should we once again turn our lives upside down, even if millions become exposed, if the symptoms are going to be like those of the common cold?"
lol jokers
who is paying for this widen healthcare???? i ratheryounot have the vtl.
all liars
"its nice to here that can now travel. but need to spend more for the required test in both country, so no point of traveling,,"
expecting the omicron to follow ur script again??
what if i am malaysian in singapore? am i eligible to receive booster at any centre here in singapore?
u can have my booster.
"don't use booster that is not eff1tive. use inactivated virus which is better and safer. look at indonesia and cambodia low figures,"
i believed omicron virus earlier already in singapore but not detected. those clown  🤡 sitting still don't know. only let's thing happen then do. wasted our money.

why vaccinate young children? makes no sense.
"it’s a good thing that the population of singapore is not armed, or i would be nervous if i were the guy in the pink shirt."
why would i travel to singapore if i have to perform a daily test for 7 days in a row. oh yeah and omicron spells the end of the pandemic and beginning of the endemic. time to let everyone get back to normal.
ya ya no point coming here with test and spent more money 🤣🤣🤣
"lol. if it really ends, then why do so many countries want mandatory booster shots?"
"actually already ended, just they can't stop making it serious, lots of money can be made"

it is not unknown but hidden from mainstream media. several countries already reported the se like heart and fertility prob. just read alternative news and not mainstream news
not much of a difference if vtl is still expensive
"gov itchy,get ready to have cases to go http://up.now/up.now is below 500 cause everybody stay at home mah,once people start going back to office you will see it shoot back to 2000.some sick also still go back say gov never check ,gov zzz on the job mah won`t be so suay kena spot check.all office workers close one eye,than have a party bring out the beers"
below 500 becos those who tested positive from art tests not counted
you can live with whatever you. but don't force the people to live with covid your way. the people are sick and tired of you talking about vaccination and the booster shot as though you are the only expert. the three of you are shameless. that's the general public consensus for the three of you. you have failed. why should the people listen to your same old story.
how about sabah sarawak
no news yet. still got to be very2 alert and careful.
<b>what is the mode of transport and how long can stay in malaysia and also can travel to other malaysia island?</b>

still talking. singapore is heading for big trouble.
they already tell you other countries have omicron
ready for next virus pi  to come after omicron.
art kit should be able to test omicron. since it is coming.
i do not want booster.
yes... rooster....
"infection rate aside, how deadly is this omicron?"
u has to try it..... 😁😁😁😁😁
kieck hog you don’t have to try to know
only a matter of time you will find out
ßpęřm yes mr obvious duh
"so far, except for the old, usually the symptom is light."
how deadly is covid 19? not everyone is dying
so far one deaths in uk
as deadly as the pandemic of disappearing cpf funds.
because we don't know yet whether this viruses can cause severeness illness to people who have certain diseases like comorbid or unvaccinated peoples and elderly too
coco mubako omg one of the rare sensible response here. yes we still don’t know much about omicron
"uk declares first death due to omicron, as hospitalizations increase and pm boris warns  of a tidal wave of infections in uk."
"wrong the person died with omicron not of omicron,, you need to see past the word games they play... the person was a elderly cancer patient..."
won't it be safer to allow travelling via private cars instead of buses and trains.

isnt a lot of industries not doing well? all affected by covid? only government bodies making money? so all of them have bonuses ? they must be more efficient and productive?

here work place not for holidaymakers
only visitors from batam to singapore but what about leaving singapore to go batam? still inside the vtl area which is bintan and nongsa only....
why always gave privileged to foreigners when they visit here during this period n no need for stay home notice.. for us we have to confain in a resorts.. movement are restricted n back to singapore quarrentine somemore... what vtl is this?
at last is not bubble anylonger..thanks so we could see family there
nowyougo there. but there not allowyougo shopping... just like prison in resort only. what a waste of money.😂😂😂😂
👍👍
havent smoked a gudang garam clove cigarette in a long long time..only can get there..
better don’t go come back deep trouble here everyday the infection is very high you are ask to stay home if you kena covid not staying in hospital nobody care for you your family member will kena too . so better stay home keep safe don’t play play .👏👏👏
must close border untill end of the year more safety for singpore
a very capable s'pore govt. 👍👍
this entire vaccine is total bs. the vaccine doesn't work on any of the covid 19 variants. also you can be fully vaccinated and still spread covid. the entire mandate is total crap!
thanks you

"if it is just for a holiday, forget it! returning to singapore goes thru the same quarantine for 7 days  which cost thousands!!!"
"indonesians make singaporean life so,hard ."
open la .. so many restrictions last tim go there no need visa all why for short term need visa?
when covid19  dispear from world we miss go singapore  again eat food and traveller
"rules travelling to batam and bintan could be relaxed, but returning to singapore will definitely be a total hassle for sure. don't want to be locked up for days and paying thousands when returning to singapore. the move is designed to boost tourism in indonesia and singapore government will never be bothered to help indonesia where they will claim that it is to safeguard singapore but will continue to allow tons of india indians in which is the main reason for the spread of covid in singapore!"
beautiful 🇸🇬 🇮🇩
"nobody will go.  the usual people going there are cheapskates and quite poor. with these costs, its almost certain the ports will remain desolate because these people will not be able to afford it anyhow, plus travelling space is limited and not the entire islands are open to tourists.  its commendable that the indonesian government is making the effort, but its not going to work....yet."
shn 7 days when coming back is a big obstacle. wait for vtl (sea) to open.
stupid  and cant fathom ur leaders make such arrangement
cheapo land
what's the point of this travel bublé to batam because we can only be allowed only vacation in nongsa batam island not other place in batam island except nongsa? what a waste of time going to batam only restricted only at nongsa batam only👎👎👎
"as indonesian my message for you singaporeans, dont forget say thanks to bill gates and the gang 👍🏼"
mistress time. mating season
better don't open. stay at singapore better .. cannot go anywhere..
only within the bintan resort or batam resort area. no allowed to go anywhere and to pd pcr test - all cost abt 300 singapored and come back singapore kena quarantine some more. not worth the travel or holiday.
"yes not worth waste money , we cant travel around batam , back singapore quarantine some more😮"
"hmm, so the journalist or delegates went to bintan for this meeting. so when they come back, do they serve shn?"
not required
jahangir ahmad why is it not required? so the covid virus do not attack journalist nor deplomats or those on special arrangements?
"muhammad nasri thanks for reply ..............they believe vip is is not human ,,,,,,,,any wayyour right"
jahangir ahmad not asking if i am right or wrong. just a question why is there a different treatment for normal visitor and this special people? that is the biggest mystery
muhammad nasri must be an equal   but the question mark will be remain for ever and ever
jahangir ahmad so the lope hole is not to be a normal visitor. hahaha. having a status is more than enough to fight covid. even vaccine is useless
"so much hassle, yet can only stay at the resort."
it's time like this you see your real friends
who will travel??? triple pcr test + insurance. this cost alone is about $250. haven include the boat cost which will cost more for vtl.
yes my parents have a chance to go indonesia
yayayyayyyayyyyyayayay
what] ]
"really shows the intelligence for policy makers to think that singaporeans would rather spend $250 for pcr tests to & fro and travel to batam/bintan for 2-3 days holidays and then return for 7 days stay home, instead of traveling to further countries for longer holidays...."
cannot buy dried shrimp and anchovies.  uncle cannot go out to enjoy special indonesian massage at a cheap rate. only allow to move within resort area.
"dont waste money and effort lah. so many restrictions and protocols to follow. unless so desperate to travel, by all means, go waste money on to go - singapore pcr, batam pcr, then back batam pcr, singapore pcr. then hotel, food, and anything will cost a bomb. better wait for normal travel"
what a useless update.for what go batam if cannot go anywhere only bintan island only.better i waste my money go sentosa more better.better not need to open the border.
"singapore giving up the indonesian air space is the reason indonesia is allowing travel-in by singaporeans. covid is just a farce to use to subjugate people. suddenly, it is not an issue anymore. haha what an obvious farce."
"why don't you guys just ask for money directly.. instead of fooling us with words such as quarantine,   reopening, shn, pcr and bubble"
woit gundu we have to quarantine foreigners no quarantine coming back here make money we have to fork money some more got go to school or not
"let's say you go with your spouse. pcr test x2 pre-departure: $125x2=$250. on arrival pcr: $125x2=$250. $500 of pcr tests for a weekend getaway in batam. then 7 days shn. good luck with your ""travel bubble"" lol."
"dont trapped in the pharmacy business, just wait and patient, lets the big country which have big pharmacy at war price."
it's not just tourism & businesses that have been severely impacted by this pandemic;  there are thousands of singaporeans with families in batam & indonesia who have been separated since the lockdown in 2019.  do have a heart to consider their swift reunion❤️
those enjoy the benefit of both worlds
dont forget say thanks to bg fauci and the gangs 👍🏼
"as a gothic, i will provide a travel experience when visiting indonesia for 7 months. i will tell you honestly because i don't like fakes, in the eyes of many foreign tourists, indonesian tourist attractions are underestimated. because they think that in indonesia there are no very attractive places such as skyscrapers, modern trending places, luxurious culinary delights and world-class tourism. but i will explain, that their thinking is wrong. for me personally, even though indonesia doesn't look fancy, it doesn't look expensive and it doesn't look stylish. however, indonesia cannot be judged by price, because it appears simple but very meaningful. that's the most important thing. when i was there, i found 81 strange and unique natural attractions that even looked like they weren't real. i was speechless, because what i saw was like a different dimension. this is no joke. let's compare and imagine, a skyscraper to me looks ordinary, a restaurant with a luxurious place to me is ordinary, a man-made tourist spot for me is also ordinary. because they are all over the continents of europe, america and asia so it's not something epic and crazy. but in indonesia you can stand in a natural tourist spot where you have experienced a major natural disaster that has impacted the world and claimed a very large number of lives. that's something very crazy in a lifetime, not only 1 or 2 places but there are so many in indonesia. that's what amazes me, something that looks luxurious can't beat something that is very meaningful in life. know about it. indonesia made an impact on the world by having a history of enormous natural disasters written by the international museum. don't get me wrong, even though indonesia doesn't look luxurious, its simplicity can have an impact on the world. in fact, many tourist attractions in indonesia are included in the category that is immortalized by the international world. i visited indonesia to learn something very important and i felt the sensation. the experience of traveling to indonesia cannot be judged by price, but by meaning. in the eyes of ordinary people, indonesian tourist attractions look unattractive because they are not modern, but for a scientist, historian and researcher it is a special trip. i'm talking about the whole area of ​​indonesia, tourist attractions in indonesia are crazy. saved in the heart. explore more than 50 tourist attractions in indonesia, then you will know that indonesia is very amazing."
"do you know about ""calonarang attraction"" in bali ?"
"g w i don't know the place, but my favorite tourist attractions in bali are the lake and mount batur"
"yes.. you have to have adventurous soul to travel to indonesia.  skyscrapers,  shopping malls, casino, etc is not indonesia's style of tourism... but hey, if it come to culinary, indonesia is up there... you can find any world class culinary in indonesia, at affordable price. organic and fresh. tourism is a not a sector that indonesia interested in to be developed. but if some area depend on it, the central government just have to support it.  also, it seems like indonesia just wants int'l tourism centralized in certain area. that's why bali is always at the front page in every indonesia's tourism ad... we don't really like foreigners wandering around the whole country. as if they're observing something. if they're real tourists, fine. but if they're from the mining industry, not fine."
"kuda jingkrak but it's true what you say, the number of tourists in indonesia is relatively small because it is only ranked 30th, when compared to malaysia, thailand or singapore in southeast asia. but whatever it is, i like nature tourism in indonesia, because it is different in each region and it makes me have an amazing experience and impression. yeah, this is no joke."
"agnesiya cordelia creamora its called as eco tourism, what we indonesia has strong value is nature, tradition, culture, etc skycrappers is boring just man-made, nothing compare to god made."
"agnesiya cordelia creamora i believe you. even me as indonesian always amazed by the nature.. have you been swimming with whalesharks...?? it was the highlights of my life in 2021... it's a shark but as huge as whale. the creatures known as 'the gentle giants', it is harmless, very mellow. it's majestic... you should try it next time you come to indonesia... it's in derawan islands, east kalimantan province. it's a beautiful tropical islands too."
"kuda jingkrak i've never been to the place you mention, it looks dangerous for someone who is afraid of sharks. but i've visited natural attractions in kalimantan named riam bedawat and sengkayang."
"kuda jingkrak there are too many natural tourist attractions in indonesia, i know more than thousands in total. therefore i only visited a few, but i wanted to return to visit the ones i had never been to."
i dont think singaporeans in general go to indonesia to see skyscrapers.
"zz7722 i don't know about singapore, maybe they came to indonesia just for vacation, while i went to indonesia to study natural history written in the international museum. so for skyscrapers or man-made, i'm not interested."
"zz7722 the typical tourist of each country is different, for example like me, as a gothic person, it is more directed to nature tourism and studying it. because for me it has a very different satisfaction when compared to man-made tourism. if only for skyscrapers or other man-made, no need to travel far. because every country has it, but it is different from nature tourism. every country has its level, for indonesia, i judge that natural tourist attractions are unique, different from each region and many."
"zz7722yg pernah saya lihat sih kalau di batam turis spore itu biasanya belanja di mall, makan dan santuy sambil ngerokok-even in mall hehehe, dan makan seafood yg enak"
don’t make sense at all. most singapore visitors go there for short getaways so it is still too much hassle to go through for 3 days of vacation. or actually 2.5 since half day is needed in indonesia to take the pcr test!  i expect it to fail.

"putting all the restrictions and inconvenience aside, i appreciate that indonesia is opening up to allow our people to travel there. hopefully more travel corridors would gradually open up as time goes by."
"wish they wouldn’t talk so much and just breakdown the costs, contingencies, sop etc"
"limited movement to only the bintan resort area, what a joke"
it will be wise to avoid leisure travelling until the protocol has revert back to the pre-covid era. we'll keep our money by sitting down to watch their tourism industry and full scale economic collapse. and then followed by a repeat of may1998 civil unrest.
very true !
exactly indeed
"who says no covid end game. - "" learning to live with covid cannot mean that we give this virus a free ride. it cannot mean that we accept almost 50,000 deaths a week from a  preventable and treatable disease."" - who chief tedros"
it's easy to spot the truth because truth will never change...  while the who... dr fauci and most world leaders are flip flopping with their neratives... judge yourself... ✌️
"while our normal lives have been paused by covid, our aging does not. appreciate any effort to get people back living to the fullest while keeping the bottom line (severe illness and death) low."
you this scared about influenza too? sheeple like you didn't bat an eye for ebola
the bottom line is we will never back to normal when majority still think that this is a pandemic.... human have been living with variants of corona viruses for centuries but the only difference to this one is it was engineered with fear...
go.... no quarantine. come back...quarantaine. whats the point....???
you said it. spot on.
it's all about money shift bro... it's not pandemic it's plandemic... ✌️ 😂
restart
"stuipd rules and protocol, confirmed no one to visit batam, bloody hell to buy insurance, fully vaccinated to take pcr, make us stupid. what they want to collect your $ beside that under table, becareful bro."
good for those who have families across the border. a time to reunite during coming festival.
bali ?
"uncles need to charge their batteries,  ktv here too expensive"
most uncles here cannot endure their chicks energy…they laughs looking at our uncles size and stamina hahahaha
"go there ok, but go back home... 😓"
"so indonesia thinks 3 days stay will not contact covid 19, hence the hope that returning singaporeans need not shn?"
all the tiko uncle rushing to batam soon.
like your father
"not worth going there even pre-covid lol the ferry and immigration alone was a hassle, imagine with multiple checkpoints and pcr testing etc."
with the mask on alone makes me no mood already
true indeed
not worth for you. but there are many seeing this as way to reunite with their love ones.
indonesia is i gear country people are friendly
great! living with virus in a safe manner.
🇮🇩❤️❤️❤️😍
booyeah.
pm lee going bintan for retreat today  .. so we no need quarantine when return to singapore… so simple logic
he at home 7 days sleeping can
too much of a hassle...not gonna travel and pay extra for the pcr art tests and rising ferry fees. i wish travelling can all go back to normal without all these testings and additional fees and inconveniences. it will take a long time before everything will go back to normal.
"not a chance in asia. you should move to the west to actually live a pre coviid life ,  best if the us."
hmm that might be possible in 2024 :(
that’s just you but this is how it is now.
"we are in asia, we all have 'island' mentality here in asia, especially indonesia. literally a group of   ""islands""."
"dont forget say thanks to bg fauci and the gangs 👍🏼 the worlds will normal if any some country at war for hard reset the minds of people and the old source of profit, war is racket, since syria and afghanistan playgrounds has closed."
"this is good for people who have husband and wives over there... but, the total cost to travel over there already reach about $500+..."
🤔🤔🤔 7 day quarantine
"not going anywhere now for me, until singapore side drop off the 7 days quarantine measure."
holiday resort 3 day happy happy😃😃....come back 7 day quarantine...make no sense🥵🥵🥵
quarantine free but they’ll poke your nose 100x. no thanks. my friend had infection after the gov pcr test!
they recycle the test kits lol
keep believing the pandemic and don't complaint...
pass.
nobody would bother with so many restrictions and tests. and sure they will jack up ferry fare as well.
oh trust me. everyone will
"fluffers if they do,  very soon there will be lots of cases in either singapore or indonesia or both and they will stop the arrangement,  just like what they did with vtl flights."
welcome to the new normal... don't complaint if you truly believe the pandemic... experiment human behaviour.... we are the victims.... vaxx or unvaxx... ✌️
haha…… 1 sided announcement again…….
it's never ending stories of erick thohir pcr test kit businesses. so lucrative that it's a major source of revenue for the government as well.
this government surrounded by absolute oligarchs
nonsense
ccn
"also, they have an incentive to give false positives as it means extracting quarantine hotel stay revenue from travellers."
"hail to all those who are inquisitive enough to investigate on their own. hail to all those who are wise enough to discern truth from falsehood. hail to all those who are courageous enough to stand up against ignorance. hail to all those who are steadfast enough not to submit to coercion & threat."
chandra hartono...  don't blame on him alone... this plandemic is just a smokescreen ....it's globally planned power shift...  shifting whatever wealth left on majority ordinary people on earth to the 1% sitting at the top... this is the new normal... great reset... nwo... you can call it whatever you want... it will only lead to a single agenda...
"abdul munir i'm just picking up voices from the ground and sharing it. voices that mainstream media either censored or ignored. so yes, you're right, it's not fair to put the blame on one person alone. it's a matter of which side you're standing and take full responsibility for all it's consequences."
ssst dont forget the lord
wonder if this will just be for people with singapore citizenship.
that great
singapore resident
i see.
"not only go batam for shopping and eating, it also for people who has wife & kids in batam .. they been apart almost 3 years .. even my father, family most of them in batam so we all need to be together again with my family again ."
wait for vtl (sea).
is time we go for a  good body relax .
visa is for people going there for work with a company work permit for the batam company not for personal reasons like visit your wife and family members. and the vtl is for 14 days only.
"restrictions to stayed in nongsa ferry terminal hotels and bintan resort only, for singaporeans have to stayed in the hotels and pay $30,000 as insurance for covid-19 ? cannot leave to batam town for shopping etc ? yet,return back to singapore have to shn for 7 days ? who wants to pay such money ? this is not logical, like this staycation in singapore or sentosa even better by using $30,000 staying for 7 days in singapore much better ."
"only can stay at resort, cannot go shopping. who wants to go?"
"travel bubble it not work, those who fully vaccinated should give them a freedom way to visit any place location, believe me it may not work travel bubble."
only booster allowed.
"if it's more expensive than ktv visits, the uncles will not take the ferry"
get a mistress in batam. cheaper than ktv or not? why not have a mistress tax?
credit to the capable s'pore govt. 👍👍
the restrictive order made tourism travelling look more like a prisoner ransferring from one gulug to another gulug.
canyouask if the connecting flight from jeddah to malaysia to manila philippines is available in malaysia ?
haiyaaaaaaa singpore high rank  opposition origin came from ipoh..penang..medan legion cantonese hainan hokkien merchandise..towkey..kapitan major cina..1st chinese scholl land in singapore donate by ipoh tin min towkey in 1600-1900
2 years worth of quality time tonight
if malaysia is where they belong. stay longer or even give up the idea of coming back. can't be that selfish by risking the others for your own benefits.
always screw up… pay extra also no point….
please stay safe.
baby
"workers who come back from singapore here must check, because the food in singapore is plastic, bottled iron is being processed into food ... later bring the virus back here."
great! a relief for many people.
malaysia and quality total opposite things
chloe husband gonna get it tonight😋
probably a few more setbacks to come but we'll get there eventually.
"why no report of malaysia to singapore , whether is land or air ? 🤣"
dont be racist ok?!!

finally hubby can relax his arm.
lol
this is such an insensitive comment. they are my friend’s parents. please watch what you say online.
"y'all careful ah, we all hope that this travel lane stay open."
wrong time to have the vtl lane from singapore to malaysia cause of the new virus spreading if singapore people bring back the virus we are going to be big trouble
choi
you can't stay closed forever
we welcome the vtl but are afraid of new viarant omicron and the other old existing viarant like delta.
have faith....
cant wait to fly home next month! thanks malaysia & singapore government for the hard work!
"the worst prime minister of malaysia. no  compassion nor dignity. he failed twice, miserably."
"it is very sad to see the comments here, most of them condemn the conversation delivered by malaysia minister, instead the people of the two countries should unite and set a good example among other asian countries, malaysia is not weak in english, even they still use their language, counted as the identity of a country. examples of developed countries such as japan, korea, thailand."
in malaysia alot of radical races still calling singapore a betrayal and dont be like singapore. hahaha… look where is singapore now. no worry malaysia coruptiion leader still rich and citizen still stupid and poor and still blaming other. good job malaysia.
my son has  better englis than you encik sabri !
semoga singapore dan malaysia hidup aman dan maju. i love my  minister  dia sentiasa buat yang terbaik untuk rakyatnya.begitu juga  minister malaysia juga buat yg terbaik untuk rakyatnya .
thank you dsis 🇲🇾
"so sad for malaysia. azam baki, flood, rfid rm35, the woes continue and continue i wonder if it’s heavenly punishment"
pm sabri read directly from a prepared text words by words.
malaysia singapore saudara dekat 🇲🇾🇸🇬
"aiya plan here and there after that said singapore to malaysia close after that said again reopen then close again,open close open close might as well close until the covid go down then reopen and ppl who can go in and out singapore and malaysia only the workers"

"why never ask najib to speech, since najib in singapore he have a good english then others xpm n he is a good pm for malaysia ppl, they become first class in the world without najibrazak, malaysia don't have twintower n klia hidup bosskurr malaysia boleh!!"
ph government under ph stop the bullet train project
kenapa tak ucap dalam bahasa malaysia?
saya kerajaan tebuk atap...
"pm malaysia needs to improve his english otherwise just speak in malay . let's translator does the job . this is an international conference , million people are watching."
konggratulate pm malaysia... ha ha ha
hsr very important for singapore. we need it
xyah duk sibuk nk buat pjanjian baru ... pbaharui dulu konsesi harga air yg spore beli dr msia.. dh bpuluh tahun xperbaharui...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqz4aoph2k&t=8m26s8:26 anyone spotted it? 😂
ah yes... malaysia's unelected prime minister..
what a laughing speech by ismail saberi
so happy fr our malaysian brothers and sisters. having the freedom to return home.  !  👍🙏
pm lee pls teach english to pm ismail to improve his level
first world vs third world country 😅
"its ok. if he gets stuck, lee hsien loong speaks bshasa v well. also mandarin and russian"
english is not our first language. pm sabri can speak english if he wants
sharan vijay what are you trying to say
afiq muqri im saying malaysia is a third world country which is the fact.
he looks very 😬 nervous.
ha-ha
look at how the singaporean pm speaks... wish our pm could speak well too...
"our pm useless just reading directly from paper written notes... look at singapore pm, he has notes as well but he maintains eye contact with the audiences all the time."
apa yg pm singapore cakap adakah pm ketum malaysia faham english tak bahlol punya pm malu rakyat malaysia beli pancing duduk kat tepii sungai aje itu kebolehan kera jaan melayu malaysia kami betul malu nak dengar percakapan bodoh kamu
make money in singapore. retire in malaysia.👍👍👍👍👍 hdb bto...99  year lease timebomb.... cpf.....just return to citizens...🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

"i very much agree that it's actually quite rude to criticize one's english level. but the sad part is our english education is so far behind and our malaysian leaders still do not realize the importance in mastering english, especially when those conservative politicians are in power. a reporter was even verbally abused by a minister and his assistant recently just because she was asking questions in english."
"malaysia ranked 2nd for many years and currently 3rd in english proficiency across asia. so not so far behind. plus you don’t need to be ‘advanced’ in english to be a developed nation. just look at japan, china, south korea or even indonesia. proud of their language."
fazril listen to our pm speech ... then think again.
"fazril yup , it including those minority talents that working overseas.  it brings the ranking up ."
"jayden pang singapore english  isn't  that good   look at henry thia and  mark lee english . i don't  think  their english  is  as good  as douglas  lim, harith iskandar  or raymond  goh. our badminton  player lee zii jia  could  speak  mandarin  , english  and  malay  fluently . don't  talk  nonsense about  malaysia  because  malaysia  boleh  means  malaysia  can ."
randy boo yeah still nothing to be ashamed. not his first language. english is not a measure of intelligenence. i still believe he is not a great leader for malaysia but still language is not how you measure thing.
even yr sultan of johor spoke out against this. ie malaysians forced to speak bahasa malaysia. he said how can malaysians compete when all their important lessons are in malay. he also said its like living in the middle ages.
lou ong they are chinese educated. also the way they speak is the mainstay of their jobs. making people laugh. the crude hokkien. our spore govt is trying to improve the way we speak. without singlish. as a sporean i do agree our english is good but not up to par. i listen to some hong kongers. they speak english so well.
fazril up to you...
"english was spoken by many during the 70s.late 70s, something happened and the powers that be started to insist medical students be taught in bharat. it was a disaster since medical staff started to migrate to australia,  nz,canada and other countries. book were translated into the javanese bhasa which is full of sanskrit and tamil. malaysians could not master what is literate or high grammar and vocabulary quickly enough. indians and chinese had to privately educate their kids so they could keep the country on the map. politicians like dumb down malays becu they can steal from the country. malays deserve good education, they should demand english."
i would like to say that our pm can speak very well in english as i am able to fully understand what they said in the meeting. the gist of communication is to let listeners understand the meaning of the speech. that all.and is as simple as that. 謝謝大家 我們需要一個好鄰 國. 希望我們能過上好日子。 所有類型的疾病都不像戰爭那麼糟糕，感謝上帝
lou ong  😂😂😂😂 just compare these 2 pm's lah. maybe lky vs dr m too.
pm malaysia 🇲🇾 tak ada tokoh seorang pm
"his english a huge disappointment.  no energy, no spark."
next is another pm ya
sabri always wan bahasa melayu to be speak in malaysia. now he jus reading  sentence by sentence. learn from pm lee. mangkuk. satu dunia tengok leeerrr
"so what if he's reading sentence by sentence? you want him to start talking like an american ke, baru nak anggap dia bagus (not to say he's bagus tho, to me he's sh*t). 'fluency in english' or speaking english in a western accent is more important than the message, it seems. if english is so great, how come you haven't taken the initiative to learn proper grammar and spelling?"
sekat sekat ismail. kenapa tak cakap bahasa melayu is d best in world. ni baca script. tu pun banyak salah grammar bangang bodoh.
english standard same as mara digital.
"malunya bahasa england pak sabri ni.. no wonder singapored1 is rm3.09 one is born and trained leader. another is backdoor, backstage leader"
baik guna bahasa melayu je pak sabri..macam president pas hari tu
pm penyu malaysia berucap bersama pm loongkang dari singapore 😀penyu masuk dalam perangkap loongkang dah.. 😀🤣🤣🤣
love him from skorea. he is the one of the best politician.
caution - most bilateral treaties agreed with singapore have not been good. my never completed the treatise remain. the keluarga melayu is for the malay only.
actually it is not a sin for a malay to rule a country
mlys pm your english command power la.mlys boleh😂
very hurtfully to singaporean
tak yah nak complain sangat la pasal english. korang english power tak jadi pm pun. memang semua benda nak kena complain ke? mentang mentang complain tu free kan. main bantai ajer la kan. dah bagus tu ada kerjasama antara dua negara.
itu la lantik yang pandai seperti anwar ibrahim bukan yang kurang berpelajaran
pm tak tau beringgeris malu la. baca script pun salah salah. panggiil dia pi ambik class inggeris. tolonggggg la.
"aviss h so you would rather have a pm yang 'pandai english' tapi sapu duit rakyat berbilion macam najib, is it?  tak tahu bi tak memalukan. itu perkara biasa for a lot of country leaders in the world. yang memalukan adalah kalau politician tu corrupted. so tak perlu nak kecoh sangat benda kecik. ministers & pm tak pandai english, rakyat tak terjejas. ministers & pm corrupted, rakyat makan pasir."
ni la mentaliti melayu yg buatkan malaysia makin mundur ..singapore lg maju dari malaysia .melayu makin ramai kerja di singapore .malaysia ramai pemimpin melayu kuat mkn rasuah sbb tu malaysia mundur kini
"everyday i see outside my window i can see the mountains of malaysia , i do miss that place , the coach trip from golden mile to  kl ... and the rest stops :)"
"there is no mountain in malaysia dude , you see somewhere else 🤣"
"pablo escobar lol..there are mountain in malaysia,do you forgot kinabalu mountain?😏"
a human the problem is that you guys don’t know the different of hills and mountains 😉
pablo escobar the problem is you don't know that kinabalu was a mount not hills😁 search google dude..you looks like don't know about this
banyak yg jakun english kt sini. klau nk nilai org punya english pergi lah sekolahjadiguru.quite a number of english usage  commentor here. if you want to asses english speakers go to school and be teacher. we focus on the content and not english proficiency here.
hahahayoucontent ya true . can be heard d whole without translate ya. take good care in only malaysia.
kalau tak tau cakap tak apa. ni ada script pun baca salah. bangang. simpan here leeerr kau.
aviss h mende ko cakap ni? english ko berterabur lah. paku serpih tul. lol
"yea that’s the mentality of you ppl, always avoid the shortcoming and keep telling yourself that, when there’s an issue, “boleh la, takpe la”, malaysia the bolehland memang boleh.  however sad it may sounds, that’s the quality of our leader and ppl, no wonder malaysia are so much behind singapore, look at how far singapore is ahead of us, when singapore independence from malaysia, they started with nothing but small island, while malaysia have huge land, blessed with strategic location in the region with the west of peninsular malaysia borders, the straits of malacca, and natural resources… but the quality of leaders, not so much… it’s just sad seeing malaysia going backwards under these clowns leadership and the rakyat are still feeling good about it…"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdqz4aoph2k&t=10m22s10:22 open-ded. im dead
👍👍👍 bravo!
"that noob no malaysian select him to be our pm,  he stole the government by his gangster group"
"a lesson for us not to sudden close our border with raw decisions no more,respect each other’s..thanks and majulah dua2 negara 🇲🇾  🇸🇬."
maju singapore malaysia
malaysian had been taken for a ride by the pakatan harapan government who was responsible for halting the hsr due to personal vendettas between najib razak & mahathir mohammad. such a waste of taxpayer money. 300 million myr not a small amount. we sincerely hoped that singapore can give & take in the name of more dynamic bilateral ties.
so suffered listen malaysia pm speaks english. so many sssssss poor english
opening of borders graced by leaders of both sides is unprecedented and represents the brotherly relationship
more like $$$$$ in both minds.
why no questions & answers session between pms and reporters?
<b>excellent news and congrats singapore & my and such an inspiring speech</b>
ismail flop era highkey serving
crazy
is this news about vtl or english? i'm confused.
"some people are simply toxic. they have miserable life and have nothing to show to their families,friends and anyone they know. at least ismail sabri has achieved something such as holding the highest office of a sovereign nation"
i missed najib's english 😁
sabri go kampong school. so what doyouexpect. can do can do lah. malaysia what.
england trained. both father and son.
"anwar""s english better"
thanks sir 😊
the good outcome of this pandemic is that both countries is closer than ever before since 1965.
visually terrible looking oral care for the oriental guy.  definitely need to see a dentist and orthodontist.  maybe need a higher salary as he appears too destitute to afford an appointment to see both professionals.
"bahasa melayu, bahasa arab, turki, rusia last sekali baru english, contohi jepun korea, maju bukan sbb pandai english"
"sebab orang jepun dan korea ada disiplin, integriti dan etika kerja bukan sebab bahasa"
bukan isu bahasa...isunya melayu ramai x disiplin bnyk mkn rasuah..nk maju mcm mana?filipina guna english secara meluas pun x maju sbb rasuah di sana teruk
"jepun korea xde tongkat dan mereka ada  disiplin, integriti dan etika kerja"
"kenapa tak guna bahasa malaysia samasa mengucap? kan disini disuruh guna bm semasa mengadakan fungsi. nak tanya juga ismail sabri tu, kalau investor dari jepun dtg nak melabur di malaysia, nak suruh kita bercakap dgn dia guna bm ke? kalau orang jepun cakap dgn ismail sabri dlm bahasa jepun macam mana? tak payah nak mengadakan arahan2 untuk melindung menteri2 bodoh yg tak pandai menanangi soalan dari pihak media. masih lagi macam katak bawah tempurung. bangsa lain tahu sekurang2 2 bahasa atau 3 bahasa."
"bahasa jepun lagi bagus dari english, kalau saya diberi pilihan, saya pilih bahasa rusia, sbb negara mereka tahu 3 bahasa tapi tak bising"
"selvmalar there is a profession called "" interpreter"". for the uninitiated like you, anyone holding the office of a head of govt has retinue of staff including interpreter to deal with delegates not speaking bahsa melayu or english"
"selvmalar. memang lah orang jepun akan cakap bahasa jepun. ko nak suruh dia cakap bahasa apa? ko ingat bila delegates dari negara2 lain datang, semua cakap bahasa inggeris ke. sebab tu semua world leaders ada translator, samdul. aduuuhhh, otak masih kena jajah ko ni. bodo tu simpan sikit."
"amity sama juga seperti anda katakan, kenapa tak guna tak guna translator kalau tak pandai bahasa lain, tetapi buat isi besar. bila otak dah sempit, memang tak dapat fikir yang terbaik!!!"
"selvmalar shelladurai huh? why would he need a translator for reading out a press release?  you do realize you're not making sense? the things you put in question are two different things. at first you're talking about what if an investor from japan comes to malaysia, would they speak in bm? the answer is obviously no, he would not speak in bm nor in english either, because investors need to discuss things in depth, so they would use a translator.  in this particular case, it's just a press release to make things officiate things, they are just reading off the press release script. you have seen how other leaders from countries do press conference, right? even macron starts out in english but later on for q&a it's in french, you do realize that right? it's a shame there's a lot of malaysians like to nitpick on petty things, when there are more crucial issues that needs solving."
"amity so true! i also cannot understand why these politicians make a big fuss over the use of bm. when they sprout utter rubbish whenever they open their mouth, it is sure to rile the right thinking citizens. nothing is in their mind but to create chaos and discontent.  bm may be the official language but does that mean you should restrict others from using it in official functions and for the pm to impose restrictions is unbelievable. all the pm's b4 him have used english as per situation. english is an international language and all literary books are in english. bm is full of words borrowed from tamil, hindi, english itself and god knows from what else. so why the fuss over the use of english. it is just too bad that some political people do not want to upgrade themselves to be marketable internationally nor locally. energy should be chanelled towards improving the economy and inviting foreign investors to invest here. inceccent talk of racial and religious issues has already chased foreign investors to singapore, thailand and india. as long as bigots sit in important posts, malaysia will slide to the rock bottom of the ladder."
wah ingatkan semua lawyer pro english 😅
dua duanya negara wayang enggak jauh beda sdm masih rendah hanya menipu belaka.. banyak ngomongnya daripada realisasi jadi ini hanya menipu
"lah lu dimana ii nyasar , pulang looo"
zayn 🤣
"would these happen if mahathir is still in charge? maybe, the border will be close permanently"
thankfully that old fart is no longer in charge
maybe malaysia prime minister needs to improve his english?
"(replying to noh abdul shukor)in fact, there is no purpose to compare which pm can speak better english. they are not english language teachers and they are not here to teach english language. many china citizens cannot even utter proper english sentences and yet they are surviving well in singapore. people from various asean countries that do not speak english are also able to work and live in singapore. the ability to communicate in english does make life easier in singapore, likewise knowing malay language make your life easier in malaysia."
agreed.
"i very much agree that it's actually quite rude to criticize one's english level. but the sad part is our english education is so far behind and our malaysian leaders still do not realize the importance in mastering english, especially when those conservative politicians are in power. a reporter was even verbally abused by a minister and his assistant recently just because she was asking questions in english."
"羅藝 louie looyi ——《羅憶錄 luo yiloo》無聊史 nah.., i think you're just being too critical of others or your mind is still being colonized by the west. other countries flourish just fine without english; japan, korea, germany, finland, and heck, even china.. for me as a malaysian, my concern is more about the corruption level, rather than one's english level.  the minister who was abusive to the reporter has nothing to do with being 'knowledgeable' in english or not, it is irrelevant. you're abusive because you're abusive, no matter what language you're fluent in.  and i'd just like to add here, the chinese community here who can speak in english speaks broken english af, but they seem to be doing fine. the white man has made you believe the 'importance of english', when it's not even the most spoken language in the world."
"amity payah jugak nak jawab ni haha. agreed that the state of corruption is of greater concern. also, agreed that the abusive nature of the minister is more apparent than his command of english. however english is also the lingua franca of the globalized world. not so much of whether it is a western invention or how fine we are doing without it but rather due to its homogeneity, english is practical and usable in international and business affairs. much like the wearing of t-shirt and jeans (a western invention btw), its popularity works in a similar... fashion (pun intended). think of english as a tool. nothing more. the current president of the united nation is abdulla shahid. a maldivian at birth, he is able to deliver his speeches fluently in english despite it not being his first language. many past presidents are also not 'white men' but is able to deliver their speech in english when addressing to the world. 70% of the finnish population can speak english. the german chancellor angela merkel can speak english but prefers to convey her thoughts in german instead, relying on a translator. can malaysian ministers commit to such valor without worrying about their 'face value'?"
"super malu to have this guy as our prime minister, straight away exposed the quality of both country’s leader by comparison. god bless malaysia under this guy’s leadership…"
so low quality
"datukalien if you must know, the politics in malaysia stabilises under his premiership. as for his command of english, in all honesty his english is acceptable.  no denying mr lee's proficiency in english is superb. but there are not there to compare english proficiency"
"shamshul anuar by all means defend him all you want, the fact that his english sucks is undeniable, and malaysia is a multiracial country, being a leader of malaysia wherebyyoucan only speak your mother tongue is so unacceptable. and instead of improving his english, he choose to “strengthen” bahasa malayu…… that’s just show how much of a person he is. what a pm coming out from kampung… that’s just sad.  talk about competing in international level when you can’t even speak proper english. you want the world to play by your rules and speak malay? wait until malaysia become top countries like china or japan, then he can speak his mother tongue however he likes and nobody will say a word about it.  stop living in a cave, stick your head out and look at the world, it’s 2021 now, countries and ppl are constantly improving, all i can see about malaysia is going backwards with all these rubbish politicians and still feeling great about themselves. i love malaysia and it’s hurtful seeing malaysia rotten under these clowns governance… god bless malaysia…"
"datukalien again you miss the point. i never say english is not important. what i said is that ismail's proficiency in english should not be an issue. if that is an issue, then many countries would be in trouble leaders of countries like indonesia, thai, russia,japan, vietnam are not proficient in english. but trade with other countries are burgeoning"
come on malaysia give ur pm a chance.he's trying his best. love fm singapore. 🥰🇸🇬🇲🇾
it's acceptable for a bilingual speaker and maybe he just have stage fright.petty issues also want to bring up.malaysia's lingua franca is malay unlike singapore which is english.he could just speak in bm as pm lee is an intelligible speaker of malay as all per all the past singapore pms like goh chok tong and lee kuan http://yew.you/yew.you guys need to chill out and look at the bright side for once.
"lol, doesn't he said want to improve bm position, then why he is using english during the event?"
the flag wrong side la
missing jb.
"4g leaders should learn from pm lee. his curiosity. yesterday mr lee pronounced omicron as ""omeecron""; today he pronounces it as ""omaicron"". ""omicron"" is the greek letter for ""o""; it has an established british pronunciation. few bother to check. mr lee doesn't take it for granted that he knows; he wondered, he checked, he chose. our 4g leaders are famously poor in their pronunciations--ccs, oyk and lw. and they haven't improved much.   we hope out future leaders would be as curious and self questioning as pm lee. singapore needs leaders who are intensely curious and always trying to improve themselves."
malaysia 🇲🇾🇸🇬 singapore 🤝
"hey , mana bahasa malaysia ? kan suruh meeting dlm bm ?"

"sabri, speak your beloved language la bahasa malaysia... come on man...🤣🤣🤣🤣"
no need to waste money and time hiring an interpreter
hes in singapore so he speaks english. whats wrong?
"jessie jamesyouknow what he speech in malaysia conference??? ifyoudon't know, pls shut up"
jessie james singapore's national language is malay.  ismail sabri asked our glcs and private sector companies to use malay during official conferences/events. but why don't he speak bm here instead? i believe singapore can understand bm also
太初 not all will understand. but we would get interpreters if that was requested fr him to speak bahasa. but i dont understand why all this criticism. at least he does read and speak  english we can all understand. he will probably improve in the following yesrs. i know some of the junior ministers speak very well. heard them speak
"jessie james kj could articulate well in english as he was educated in singapore & oxford university. the others who are proficient in english are ku li, rais yatim, nazri aziz, hishamuddin etc."
太初 pm lee can speak malay also.
god bless
baca scipt ke bangsat
"everybody is comparing singapore pm fluent of english & malaysia pm. of course singaporean english is better because english is medium language in school & working place. in malaysia...malay is their national lan guage. they use malay language in school, working & social. very rare they talk english. they only talk english when meeting with foreign delegates. at least they try their best to 'speak english'. ifyoucompare to china, korea, japan, indonesia..... they are 'more worst'. even during meeting with foreign delegates they dont dare to speak english even in international forum. they speak in their own language then the translator will explain in english.youall dare to conderm president of china, president of indonesia, japan pm & korea president for cannot speak english?"
"nobody dare, cos even widodo command more respect than sabri"

"bear in mind, for most countries....english is just a foreign language. without english they still survived. only in singapore.....ifyoucant speak english....u die."
"can’t a person be fluent in two languages, especially in a country like malaysia"
"hello it’s 2021 already and almost 2022,youstill living in a cave is it? countries and peoples are dealing with each other, we all are interconnected in this world, and english is the international language, shouldn’t that proficiency in english the most basic requirements as a leader of a country? yes compare malaysia with indonesia but don’t compare malaysia with china korea or japan, malaysia don’t have the power and international level of influences as compared to those countries, as sad as it may sounds, whenyouare a smol potato, ppl and countries expectsyouto follow their standards and converse in english. when malaysia is as strong as china korea or japan then nobody will bats an eye when the leader speaks in his own language, hell he can even talk nonsense like donald trump and ppl will still accept it 😑😑😑"
"it’s just sad that this is the quality of our leader, god bless malaysia…"
"wrong! its not just english. its the technicity in the speech. singapore pm can speak english, chinese, malay, tamil. singapore ministers are highly qualified and under a meritocracy system.  malaysia only berhasa malayu and only malays dominate the country through racial system. this is the difference."
datukalien yooolah
"seandainya  kalau itu indonesia ,, pasti akan berbicara bahasa indonesia di luar negara maupun didalam negeri sendiri. sangat bangga menjadi orang indonesia sangat kuat jati diri nasionalisme dinegara sendiri 🥰🇮🇩.."
"well said, but considering pm9 is a lawyer, not ordinary kampung pakcik, i must say his english is below par 😅"
"alexandria school of science noted. so what is the issue here? i mean no disrespect to jokowi but i must say his english is ""not adequate"". but that is not an issue. because the countries that he visited ( just like ismail) are more interested in bilateral ties. something that toxic people like you simply unable to comprehend"
shamshul anuar 😅😂🤣
alexandria school of science 😅😂🤣
what is the meaning of ' more worse '?
"agreed. there is no need to compare. we should proud of our own language. but, not to forget other language as second or more language"
"joey cheang yeah right, for a multicultural country, it's a given for a person to at least be bilingual. i mean in official settings in malaysia pun, sometimes they are held in malay and english jugak, for the convenience of everyone. english is not the official language but it's used in official settings. there is still an importance to master english, especially when you are a representative of the country to the world. english is a foreign language here but it's taught as a second language kot... aiyo"
"totes malotes nobody denies the importance of english. may i enlighten you on ismail's environment. ismail is an mp of bera. the constituant is a semi rural setting with vast majority of people are malays. ismail leads the govt of malaysia and the national language of malaysia is bahasa melayu. in comparison, njib had his tertiary education in england. thanks to his living in uk as a student, his command of english i must say is very good. in malaysia, all corp statements are in english actually. as for those who keep criticising ismail on his proficiency in english, do understand that such proficiency is never a factor with regards to. ties with singapore. because both leaders are not morons. they are more interested in economy. why on earth we have vtl. economy"
"do you know that once upon a time (before 90s) our english equally good with singapore? the change of curriculum and medium of instruction in the 70s and the implementation of racial based quota system contributed to deterioration of mastering the language. don't forget that english is still the most important language in malaysia than bahasa in majority dominant field in this country e.g law,medical,accounting,finance and in private sectors. the actual fact is you have to know bahasa if you got to deal with government sector . korea, japan ,china are well known for their hard work community, a historical culture and their contribution in research and development especially in science and technology field, that is the reason they are proud of their mother tongue."
why not speak bahasa melayu.
malay is not a language of international diplomacy and trade
tim loo1 sabri speaks malay with a strong pahang accent. lhl malay is more baku and standard
speak malay only in country but outside country speak english in diplomacy or trading...
"kalau itu indonesia ,, pasti akan berbicara bahasa indonesia sangat bangga menjadi orang indonesia sangat kuat jati diri nasionalisme dinegara sendiri 🥰🇮🇩"
tim loo1 kalau kurang mahir berbahasa inggris apa salahnya letak bahasa melayu ?? mending pakai bahasa negara sendiri menunjukkan jati diri nasionalisme. sekarang tengok jepang korea thailand china turkey indonesia pun mereka kini gunakan bahasa identitas negara di antara bangsa. zaman sudah canggih
tim loo1 mereka bilang nationalisme...tp rakyat mereka sendiri hina negara mereka bakar bendera mereka sendiri malah ada warga mereka sendiri bikin parodi lagu kebangsaan mereka sendiri 🤦
he don't know leer. reading d script is bad too. he only wants bahasa melayu in malaysia. sad malaysian. he is stupid n he is also making malaysian stupid too. well done singapore

"singapore & malaysia have failed miserably to contain covid. despite this failure both countries has initiated vtl by air & road. the  omicron variant is a serious concern & warrants attention.  japan & israel have closed borders . who said "" variant of concern "" despite thee warnings both premier's are acting irresponsibly with vtl travel.  pointless to talk about anything.  hsr, iskandar & others.

"amity that’s not true.go reflect yourself seriously and your laziness will only drag your country’s progress. fun fact,your country is a joke as major ethnic needs minor ethnic helping hand and waste so much of subsidy from high corrupt government.hahaha. stop taxing “other citizens”disproportionately and please treat everyone equally👎🏾"

hakim sapiee  in another life n world… sheep 🐑 alert 🚨
"5zaft mohd countries like congo, indonesia, philippines and malaysia who are corrupted are invited? they got best democracy ah? even us where got riots in the capitol building and donald trump can talk abt democracy 😆😆😆"
shiela tee typical oppies 🤡
hakim sapiee   sheep 🐑 alert 🚨  loser comment.  got played by politician still so dumb!
"5zaft mohd biden is cognitively impaired, a puppet president!  trump (and other past  usa presidents)  respected singaporee so much he selected singaporee as the venue for meeting with nkorea. be thankful our pm and his team have our backs, okay?"
"5zaft mohd we were among the first few being invited to the ""league of democracies"" together with s.korea and japan in 2020 but we rejected it first hand, you didn't know that? you want me to dig out the video for you? it's on youtube."
shiela tee that's your opinion. respect other people's opinion.
jasmine teo  just get educated about this man who need fica to keepyouin the dark about how the world see him. youknow nothing about the damage this man have cause to all the work of his late father.  this is not about respect. i do not know u.  this is just a wake up call.  likeyousay another opinion. we are not here to agree with each other.  show me a leader i will showyouwhat respect looks like 😉 have a great day n take care of urself.  this man will not care one bit!
george ho  the only reason is simple… we rejected it as s korea n japan are strong allies of usa.  we are not neutral when it comes to chinaus relation. this man is very clear where he stands but he does not represent the people.  letting china come into this country m just take what they want is what a traitor looks like!  he burned that bridge with usa a long time ago.
jasmine teo  respect singapore 😂😂😂 they come n take what they want…while the ones in office serve their self interest n investment. displacing the people livelihood n future.  we are just a tax haven to them to hide their millions.  trump!???youreally need to read up…as long as we foot the 20 million bill with his date with kim he is good to go.  all past presidents are proxy to israel.  we have a debt to pay to them for building up our military in record time.  there is no free lunch ~ mortem f an economist not lky 😉
jasmine teo  that trend ~ cognitive impairment is prevailing in all current world leaders.  especially madxi ccp.  so unless covid gets them…there not much we can do.
shiela tee wow crazy ladyyouhere
alexandria school of science  you must be such a loner… following me around is far crazy  that is such a loser civil servant  play.  go get a life…

shiela tee i wondered whyyouso triggered and have so much time on internet 😀
jasmine teo  😂😂😂 no need their policies to do well in life…  that is the trap 🪤 they set up for the likes of u.  i was never raised that way.  they increase everything under the sun then put in place financial programs to askyouto beg them from ur money.  the tax dollars.  any act that need a financial support program is already an epic fail. above all while everyone got their pay slashed up to 70% during the pandemic. this useless n his people continued to pay themselves well.  they jacked up the healthcare premium up to 33% the moment they got that 61%.those are not the singapore core vote.  thus the outburst in parliament by this crybaby holding to the tailcoat of a dead father http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freeriders#freeriders he is the biggest one to date!  just get ready they have plans to jack up the gst tentatively in july 2022. wow! people likeyoureally amaze me.  it never ease to amaze me. btw this is not always about me.  many opposing opinions are not about oneself.  it is a voice for many where their needs are not met.  the ones who are displaced n this is for my future generation. good foryouif their policies benefited u.  must be one of them. that is how the system is.  it is no longer about knowledge or whatyouknow.  it is all about whoyouknow.  relax…don’t get ur panty in a bunch.  this is after all not about u!  there’s nothing personal here 😉
shiela tee how it feels like being a failure and rant on internet? curious
tim loo1  personally i hope she just resign from her post.  i don’t stand for lack of integrity or honour from any party.  i am looking for sound leadership for all.  the opposition have worked hard for the people.  that woman is just too caught up in her woke culture mentality.  she needs to know she is no longer working for an interest group.  she is an mp serving the people.  wp need to be firm n discharged her from the post.  there is no need for a new election in sengkang just like when they select that lady from another grc to be the president http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23notthepeoplechoice#notthepeoplechoice there are others in wp.  nichole seah could just do her work as she is peranakan rather than all chinese.  she speaks malay english n chinese.  no reason wp in sengkang will shortchange the residents in sengkang grc. unless some salty uncles n aunties from the ruling party wants to go there.  their junior mp already sue a resident n got 1k.  arrogance at their best. even a nobody now so brazen to sue residents who put them there in the first place.
tim loo1  your assumption of me…is just that thinking too highly of bahasa yet this useless uses english most times.  he too need to practice his bahasa for all his showcase speeches.  why not petition it to moe to teach in bahasa 😂😂😂 ccs don’t even know cotton comes from a plant.  he will die n end up with mass resignations in his hands. less arrogance more sense… common sense is such a rare commodity…u need to get some 😉 language is a personal choice.  so don’t…just don’t act like a loser just cos i don’t entertain u.  i am surrounded by needy people here.
alexandria school of science  yeap i have my own schedule. unlikeyoua slave to a master.  so just go on your way.  soooo needy…
alexandria school of science  you are here too…  only a failure can identify with one  😂😂😂youmust really be at the lowest end of the food chain in ur organisation to be going after me this much.  i really pityyou😂😂😂
"shiela tee aiyoh so many replies for my one question....auntie, go cook dinner already lah"
shiela tee the motive and reason of lhl rejecting the invitation is not what and why i reply to mohd. why do you represent him? the truth is opposite of what he claimed that's it. and you don't represent anyone to reject the legitimacy whether lhl represents the people or not. you can have your very simple views and interpretation of us-singapore relations and that is your prerogative. it really doesn't bother me.
george ho  so just chill…don’t need to get so worked up.  my respond not about u. nothing personal. i too wanted to tell mohd the same thing.
alexandria school of science  so say a salty uncle 👋
shiela tee so triggered ah auntie 😅😂🤣
alexandria school of science  far better than a needy loser civil servant…😂😂😂
shiela tee aiyoh so triggered
congratulations

great
sad heard one person has been detect covid in a border of malaysia entry for first day of vtl ...from singapore.....better checkyouin proper than release from there...hmmm
"why only 3000 people? why only long term pass holders? why only bus? it's not about all these. it's about how to allow crossover in such a way that ""safe distancing and wearing masks"" can be maintained while crossing. hence, private vehicles (not more than 4 pax in each vehicle)  and those without long term pass should be allowed to cross  too without further delay."
"omicorn  could change everything , 😢"
standby for another outbreak
"was this need 30thousand dlr insurance?   how bout those who have family like batam,pinang and etc?    they also need to meet thier family there..,"
"this is another scam, be honest in singapore side.  are singaporeans  ready for this scam. this scam is the most important thing for both countries. who care about the rakyat or the country."
do that do this so many thing ma ermm don't go la
call the to go back and stop coming back.
"we will soon be dealing with the variant nu. then, we can award ourselves gold medal for the control."
u1fb
still talking. singapore is heading for big trouble. stop. vtl. the malaysian government and it people's always threatened singapore to turn off the tap. no water supply to singapore.
dr ma no more chance to bark liao.   the rest of them should have learnt their lesson after the pandemic.   with lesser house renovation the lesser noise complaints 😉
"well done, step by step."
come2 to malaysia eat nasi lemak teh'o and nasi goreng 👍
the one thing that i must agree. malaysian's food. superb.😋
"if i am a singapore pr i go back malaysia via vtl, do i have to at least stay 14 days in malaysia before i can come back to singapore?"
we need more ft
<b>just be mentally and physically prepared for that 2359 cos anything goes in the pandemic world</b>
if those malaysian were to miss their country so much. probably they can stay back at malaysia for longer period of time.
those malaysian has a job to do if they stay longer how are they supposed to support their family!?
these malaysians chose to stay in singapore for work reasons and they have been there pretty long not being able to see their families and this is the only good opportunity that they have to see their families again without going through 2 weeks of  quarantine which costs them money and ifyouhave faith in your government than believe that they made the right decision
"buses can spread infection more efficiently. so, they choses the buses."
within 8 mins all tickets sold out for the past 30 days 🙄🙄🙄🙄
ica website says art is only valid when certified by a registered lab. why then are we testing ourselves by the millions everyday if they are neither certified nor valid?
"different purpose lah. you last time got do past year paper or not? not certified, not valid but help you assess mah. when you want to go jc or uni then must be certified lah. you ownself stay at home do art see if you got covid. if you go overseas other govt say ownself say ownself no covid no use. just like you do past year paper at home, ownself say ownself 100% who believe. understand?"
derek chew  same purpose. to check whether got covid or not. ica check got invigilator. cannot cheat. at home check got no invigilator. can cheat. that's why home check not valid. for wayang only. understand or not?
welcome back to work ica officers  👏👏
where have they gone to?
under government they could rest at home and still be paid.
both govmts lose millions for each days delayed in opening. let watch and see how the overpromise and underdeliver drama unfolds.
where to buy ticket for bus?any link?
有华語解说吗，听不懂，
the risk is so high is this the right time to go jb
not unless you want to get robbed or infected.
richard w singapore case still high don't go m'sia and infect their ppl.. lmao
richard w please. yall have a higher covid cases per 100k capita than us also want to talk arrogant.

最不想看到的广告！肮脏龌龊！低级！下流，太多了吧！任何节目都躲不过！
"good lucks to those entering mysia, alot hungry 😈 waiting for you."

nobody cares
"dear sir ,what about those who need badly to go jb for banking badly for a  day  trip what is the procedure pls thks so much. i’m from pg"

u  he
😆🤣😄😂😅🙂😐
"singapored 15 to go there, rm 20 to comeback. what a ripoff, and we can't even have the option to walk, you tell me pay so much, i would walk."
"you can walk. just that you don't qualify for vtl exemptions, must serve quarantine.  from ica website: as required under the vtl (land) conditions, a vtp holder must arrive in singapore on a designated vtl (land) bus service. all travellers who do not arrive on a designated vtl (land) bus service to singapore may be denied entry into singapore and/or subjected to prevailing border measures.  travellers who are allowed to enter singapore will be subject to category (ii) health measures upon entry into singapore."
derek chew so the nonsense this rule
"derek chew sir, what about a bus from jb to singapore, but not under vtl? say, ipa holder who need to do 1week quarantine? any bus operate? or a taxi? or a shuttle?"
vaccinated or not when out best to have 2 disposable masks .1 when leave house for the work .before leave work change a new one or going other places. cheap n safe .
so long never go relax at j b  ..body ache n jammed
😂
so dont go...lh
back to work!!! 😆
too all singaporean please dont anyhow book think for our fellows malaysian they need to meet their family
"for singaporean living in jb and have to return to work every day in singapore, what's the procedures?"
work in jb
aikk singaporean stay in jb...hmmm
all comments bodoh....low iq....fight for what....not happy...just demolish causeway....garmens here n there tried to find solutions..all these bodoh comments like spore dont come here...mesia dont come here...till when....ah...if both no cooperation..how...at least be humane...humanitariun....at least have tis pure heart...think about...all human beings need to find work..food...to survive....if both have this evil heart...how...till when....aiyoh..pls lah....
"with 13 air vtls and 1 land vtl. it means they are free to mingle with the public without quarantine even though the incubation period is 3 to 5 days. and what happens when the numbers spike again? reduce the dining in pax from 5 to 2, then to zero. keep repeating the same playbook. that's all they know how to do."
well then what you suggest we lockdown and close border and don't open up forever?
lisa lim  no.
lisa lim that is good
lisa lim  someone likes your stupid question. as if i'm going to say yes.
anyone knows how to purchase bus ticket from jb to singapore? have no clue at all
u can call your ambase passport centre
malaysial pokai already no money hahaha. see la last time scold us for coming in and splurge. now no money🤣
i would say is lament. not until scold
"david nah last time i go shopping at city square johor and i eavesdrop on this group of malaysians talking thrash about singaporeans. now, im laughing at them cos they are begging us to come over again."
singapore kiasu pukimak barking 🤣🤣🤣
kao chai mai hahah your country poor. begging us to come🤣 want to cut water but we are the one cleaning the water for you guys to safely use. big country but small brain. your pm how many times want to change ah?
kao chai mai lure of singapore dollar...not bark but roar...keeemok
"pakalu papito actually singapore dont need their water, singapore already self sufficient, just paying them lip svc n let them earn $$"
80% of jb taukeh living on singaporep money is pounding sands now
i bet by 9 months johor population will increase cos new babys on the way🤭
one in three will be gone with the wind two years from now.
boomers generation part 2
ayosflame  i guess it is bad news for those planning to reduce the world population due to scarcity n survival of their class.
another wayang wayang. useless . look at indonsia and singapore new cases you will see what payandpay is so useless
why doyouworry about cases? no country can prevent cases? we can prevent serious illness and fatalities.  get vaccinated
rs lin  yeap i do agree withyouabout the spread of the virus.  yet you need to understand that the pmo n mtf is never prepared for any surge in cases be it in the past or the future.  17k recovering at home with no clear help a month ago from moh is why importing more cases into the country is like shooting oneself in the face.  it will be a strain on our healthcare system n personnel.  stop ✋ think 💭 before you comment.  i really hope the wfh default didn’t fry your brain cells.
rs lin  that vaccination program of 75% got us the increase cases as the drug suppress the symptoms of covid n with delta fast 2 days incubation period… many just got infected. the current data is clear.  the ones who are vaccinated are the ones who are infected.  so more knowledge less…mindless sheep 🐑 thinking.
shiela tee you are then mindless. nobody say vaccinated won't get infected.
lisa lim  you are definitely right. she is out of her mind.a troll trying to paint the government as bad as she can. very bad citizen
wonderful news
wonderful indeed.
spread more covid😃
don't let fear control your life. covid cases there will be. not to worry
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
tq
great news for malaysian worker only livelihood matters not singaporean scared to go malaysia
aiyoooo remember we r not welcome 😁🤷
nope im not setting foot until i get to bring my bike along for the trip..
get ready for cases to go up.... govt pointing fingers at us than again dining 5 go back to 2.
who is pointing fingers at you? what a stupid statement.  nobody cares .it's up to you to take care of yourself. are you an infant?
"i don't think so,take care"
"fiost lols susu just said govt pointing and yet here you are asking who is pointing. learn to read maybe? im dont think susu is right, but i think you are funny, thx for the entertainment"
well the community cases is caused by social interaction so if you do not want to reduce in dining in then be responsible.
"i ask, expect less covid cases with this vtl ? 🤣🤣🤣 i think so lah. 🤫🤫🤫 cross infections unlikely or likely spreading to the rest or not? covid so easy to control? its an acute respiratory highly infectious disease. that much the world knows. commonsense is never common"
great time to get robbed!
they are waiting for us. https://youtu.be/akmkssptjfshttps://youtu.be/akmkssptjfs
new land man
"no worries, come here work with rate 1:3 of course sure come lol."
can you do those jobs? are you willing to do? why are you jealous? everyone who is prepared to work hard deserve income. why we need to bother about the exchange rate? give them a break
too many mix citizens like rojak 😂😂😂😂
yeo lee  singapore is an open city to talents and trade. not for us to live like frogs
"sure bo, later use water increase then , electric increase to sell to singapore 😂😂😂😂😂"
yeo lee  nothing is http://free.be/free.be updated
"yeo lee maybe start with the fact that singapore is too full of ethnically chinese people like yourself, so it's still not a rojak like you feel. just that you're so used tomseeing mostly chinese people around that when more of other ethnicities are around, even temporarily, you get triggered."
why is the rgl still not open....
there's no more tickets for next 30 days🙄🙄🙄🙄
within 10min all tickets sold out🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
"more singaporean will come and stay in johor. any increase just 0.1% singapore residents in johor must be countered with the nationalization of indonesia, bangladesh, pakistan or indian people in malaysia."
spreading ills? now we know why you are posting all the hate posts against the spore government.  you are not a singaporean. more of the tribal type who are out to create chaos here. get lost
well if singaporeans can afford it than y not....
su su new law stated singapore only can buy house price over 1 million
we already have a pandemic of mesian motorcycles creating traffic terror on the roads even now before the border is open..
deep state  what has that got to do with you? your post is full of racial and religious undertones. get lost
bmpcos stating fact. we can't just let colonization of singapore goes unheard of
"deep state  what facts are you talking about? you are more worried about the 0.1% singaporeans colonising johore that you are pushing to balance from indonesia, bangladesh  etc very strange leh"
"bmpcos only india, europe and us can stop chinese colonization of se asia. malaysia and indonesia has the duty to help the rise of india, europe and america until singapore was return back to malay majority."
deep state  this is a racial post. get lost please
"i saw your bio it says ""cyber bully"" so basically it is a spam account"
cheesecake • 99 years ago  are you the same type? stroking racial issues?
cheesecake • 99 years ago the only way to deal with colonizer by humiliating them even it takes 100 years or 1000 years.
deep state  who is them?
bmpcos the fake chinese in singapore
deep state  playing again?
a great happening. spore and malaysia must continue to be linked .both sides will benefit. good job mmtf
nice to see positive comment among the endless chain of 🐮 bei 🐮 bu.  the world needs more positive energy sources like you.
mole man  being positive doesn’t do much for many when every measure is a knee jerk reaction to things they should be prepared for.  remember min gan words when he was in moh ~ we will never go red followed by throwing the descorn measurement tool out the window which many developed nations are still using.  arrogant ignorance of the pmo is whyyoudon’t see positive comments about them here.  the effect of covid is different for everyone.  so do get educated on what happening on the ground not just the pr stunts of those living in condos n well off individuals serving their quarantine or recovering at home. it is doing the right thing n putting the right people in charge of a health crisis far important so that we don’t end up burying more of our elderly daily.  their to go mantra for vaccinated death ~ complications n preexisting condition.  must make sure their vaccination program not a joke.  so go shove that positivity up where the sun don’t shine cos it means nothing in the scheme of things! they screwed the people on the day the wuhan virus hit our shores n min wong meltdowns while your useless pm having a ball in davos which is the playground for millionaires n billionaires.  have you ever think why a civil servant in the pmo doing there!??? he is only a civil servant n need the law to be on his side when it is convenient for him!  hereyoua sheep 🐑 thinking they care!???
shiela tee spot on. false sense of optimism is detrimental to one's physical and mental health.
is service 950 is operate till end novemeber.
what is the rush to open? cant they wait another 2 to 3 months
"why not, any significant difference it will make?youstatistician ah....aiyoh"
why 2 or 3 months? any reasons?
"i'm sure the mmtf have made calculated decisions based on available data already. with all said and done, they're not fortune tellers and can't see the future.  all of us have to play our part against this virus."
christmas and chinese new year otw dunno wat will happen.  while you choose to earn more overseas be prepared for the consequences    be safe
tomorrow will always be tomorrow.
we need to test the efficacy of the vaccines..
lim doris  observe safety protocols and live normally  don't let fear take over your life. all countries are having this problem.
"why can't wait 2 to 3 months.....if you grow money plant at home, you can wait in your bedroom for another 10 years."
money. johor and malaysia no more money. so many business in johor shut down. malaysia begged singapore to allow this vtl despite high covid cases
"pakalu papito what a joke.. m'sia didn't begged at all.. it's about the workers and singaporean who have house and family there.. this border opening benefits mostly malaysian and singaporean who have property, business and family.. such a stupid commentsyoupost."
sweetkiller xx hahaha clearly no job in malaysia
omicron is coming….. faster than getting the data
ishaki kenobi ya hahah until their people have to cross border. they still can scold us when we are the reason some of their people got rice bowls
pakalu papito hello dont put blame on malaysia ....see both sides k...
sinkies gg jb don’t cry father cry mother if got robbed or raped
it's a matter of time! such news make good read.
prepare for infections rates to go up again. f&b will bear the brunt of this decision. good luck to those not vaccinated.
great news
"🤣😂🤣😂🤣  it means jobs for malaysians,  more virus cases for singapore residents."
troll shut up lah
des chan -----up --up -up and up --more and more may ko
finally our malaysian bros and sis will be able to be reunited with their families. stay safe my siblings ....
deschan yes but you guys can go malaysia buy cheap2 ice cream and groceries 🤣🤣🤣 typical singaporean
des chan is a troll who objects everything
so it's a win win for both countries.
our virus cases are not little as well. to say this is just turning a blind eye to our own problems.
please don't mind him guys. this is his entitled daily 2 hour entertainment from his permanent stay in the imh.
"this guy has a point, you guys cant even rebut him. what has that got to do with buying cheap grocery and whatever? dont deviate from the statement. why dont you guys come out with a valid arguement?"
"monka eternal mine is not valid? singapore also got cases, we are also bringing cases over (if pcr tests dun work)?"
"jacq low i cant really tell who is from where btw, if you think yours is valid, sit yourself out. im waiting for those who mentioned about what imh and what not."
monka eternal nothing to do with you. don't kaypo.
"monka eternal  you're absolutely right. don't even know why they comment when they don't have a valid argument. it's always the same old nonsense. i guess they like to hear themselves talk, that's all."
"you guys must be new. this des chan have been spreading lies and nonsense in many videos. when faced against facts, he will ran, hide and resurface on another video.  many of us already tired of reasoning with him. he posts nonsense, we post nonsense too =)"
"keonz  even the mmtf says that as we open, we can expect more cases. you disagree with the mmtf as well? just put up your argument if you have any. we can decide who makes the better argument. you don't need to tell us."
"jp phua sigh, another illiterate. when did i say i disagree with the mmtf? i don't have to put up anything? i post as and when i like. as mentioned, already tired of presenting facts to people that just don't accept them. now i follow des chan style and post only nonsense. i don't care what you think. problem?"
keonz  you agree with mmtf that cases will increase. he also agree that cases will increase. so what's your argument then? and guess what? he has 23 likes. you have zero. why is it my problem when you admit you're posting nonsense?
monka eternal  the guy who mentioned imh admits he's posting nonsense.
by population singapore case much more worse than malaysia.. even johor total case much more lower.. don't be salty..
"sweetkiller xx  agree. without quarantine, who spread to who also don't know."
jp phua a nonsense troll have like only show more nonsense people
"jp phua you must understand that people cross border with testing and only those tested negative allowed to go, nobody here letting them roam freely, i think the government knows what they are doing, both countries have their ups and down.. live with it."
"sweetkiller xx  again i agree with you. you need to chill. not everyone is against malaysians. both governments are taking risks. johoreans get stereotyped by singaporeans. singaporeans get stereotyped by johoreans. it's always been that way. we, on both sides have to live with the decisions both our governments make. we have no choice."
"jp phua lol like i said, you must be new. have you seen all his other nonsense comments in other videos? all of them have dozens and even hundreds of like. so? do i look like i care about the number of likes? nonsense is nonsense.  he got his antivaxx friends in youtube to ""like"" for him so? they're only 5% of the population. guess who is majority?  again, this has nothing to do with you. unless you're one of his antivax friends then well, screw you too =)"
keonz  did you not just admit to posting nonsense? why then should anyone take you seriously? i rest my case.
jp phua you really can't read can you. at which part of my comment did i ask you to take me seriously? 🤣
keonz  why do you assume i took you seriously when obviously i did not. you made it very clear you were posting nonsense. it's bad enough you're posting nonsense. but you don't have to show us you're stupid doing so.
jp phua lol maybe because you're still replying to me despite being told not to? you.must be really illiterate 🤣
"keonz  if i cannot read, how to reply?"
jp phua omg! mind blown
aiyoo telling malaysian nly...wht abiut singaporean who coke to jb makan makan tidur...jalan jalan they r not ha...dont just keep blame them nlylh...see own side also aiyooo
great news. thanks to the responsible and capable s'pore govt for taking a calibrated approach to opening up.
capable yet covid cases 3k daily lol.
dear god…just zip it already.  spore is on the naughty list of high infectious nation to date per million.  they have no choice…opening up everywhere but not malaysia will end up with a riot in their hands after 2 yrs of not seeing families for malaysian workers.  that thanks should go to the healthcare professionals frontliners essential workers food delivery plus all other people in various agencies trying to make sense of the knee jerk measure of an incompetent mtf n the pmo. they only read scripts…don’t even know how to analyse data.  make their own conclusions based on their political survival not on science n research.  here you are thanking them!  just stop ✋  just make things worst by their lack of intelligence to confuse the public.  not an ally of usa yet does everything that comes out from their cdc n biden administration.  total bs at work!
shiela tee you then bs
shiela tee sorry singapore govt how along is based on science
lisa lim  go help grace fu plant a tree 🌳  she has about a million of them to plant after china construction companies cleared the land in kranji protected area. her pledge during cop26 where no one was listening to her to do list😂 make yourself useful.  don’t waste my time with your incoherent posting!  it is just exhausting on top of listening to lawrence n his team excuse explained themselves away every other day.
lisa lim  whose science??? their political appointees experts n scientists.  that is what bswork looks like.  you will not see it coming if it hityouin the face… just stand down already🙄
woow
good job everyone almost over
it's just the beginning.
so many died already since we started going forward in the past 1.5months..
this is making me reconsider going to korea in april... seems like a hassle
"and now (10 dec '21) south korea is having its worst outbreak since pandemic. thank you vtl, i guess??"
don't you really know yet that vaccinated people infect each other and transmit the coronavirus? how is it possible?
singapore is spreading virus through vtl. first germany now s. korea. both countries are having its worst outbreak since vtl was established 2-1 month ago.
need electronic visa? im travelling for 7 days only
kankokujin.
"korean’s performances in tokyo olympics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf1udbpvxjyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf1udbpvxjy"
"well, we might as well maybe a few more months waiting to travel as what you seen here such troublesome getting everything paper in order and the waiting in long time will so tiring especially for the senior citizens. unless there some matter important things to do then okay but if going for a holidays better wait a few more months rather having situation like refugees chaotic trying to go somewhere."
few more months then omicron
it is a good move to have vtl with south korea. a lot of people like to have a break after 2 years of the trauma. living with covid is like this
too much trouble but south korea is still safer than india. at least i don’t have worry about my daughter being gang rape on a public bus.
"last year before the existence of the covid vaccine, 1/5 of patients were covid patients.  but after the vaccine existed, almost all patients were detected covid, the majority of patients in the hospital were those who had already completed the vaccination.  the phenomenon is found now where patients (who are fully vaccinated) are hospitalized with problems such as:  -micro-clots of blood at the ends of the legs/arms, in the intestines, lungs  - heart attack  - inflammation of the heart  - stroke  - blood problems ... etc.  direct hospital protocols are ineffective for treating covid patients, while burdening the patient’s body.  remdesevir is given in doses, contributing to multi-organ failure including kidney, lung and liver.  ards lung injury (lung injury), pneumothorax (lung damage) due to forced ventilator machine.  all of this is due to medical protocols!  not the result of covid disease!"

"in short, unless you are a bit of a self hating sadomasacist with little or no self respect,dignity, but lots of time to waste,lots of money energy and resources to waste, enjoy hassle, agitation, irritation,misery in general?  then one shouldn't even consider a trip to south korea. a trip to north korea seems more welcoming and less awful at this stage. the madness , absurdity keeps on going. the brave new world of covid19-84. comply, conform, obey and believe, or else!"

"scientists mystified, wary, as africa avoids covid disaster - 18 nov 2021 “covid-19 is gone, when did you last hear of anyone who has died of covid-19?” ndou said. “the mask is to protect my pocket,” he said. “ the police demand bribes so i lose money if i don’t move around with a mask.” earlier this week, zimbabwe recorded just 33 new covid-19 cases and zero deaths, in line with a recent fall in the disease across the continent, where world health organization data show that infections have been dropping since july. when the coronavirus first emerged last year, health officials feared the pandemic would sweep across africa, killing millions. fortunately, such catastrophic scenario has yet to materialize in zimbabwe or much of the continent. our mainstream media try to hide the fact that covid mysteriously out of sight in the african continent."

"a western australian police officer has been admitted to the hospital following an adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine which saw her suffer a stroke caused by blood clots. the officer confirmed in a facebook post that doctors concluded her transient ischaemic attack was an “adverse effect from covid vaccination.” plastic surgeon and australian medical association (wa) president, dr mark duncan-smith, said there was no scientific proof the pfizer vaccine caused the stroke and at present the tga does not list blood clots as a possible side effect of the pfizer vaccine. “it’s like saying i had my pfizer injection and within two weeks i had a car accident. therefore, pfizer injections cause car accidents. there is no evidence to suggest that pfizer is associated with strokes or tias,” duncan-smith told the west australian. this is a good illustration of the brain make-up of vax fanatic."
"restrictions will be totally lifted in the next upcoming year towards 3rd quarter 2022. going now is no point, many place and shops still closed ifyouexit seoul. in seoul, also not everything is open. and too many restrictions still in place, better to wait til mask off."

millennium thinkaporeans in red dot 🔴 majulah kita singapura 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬 are all doomed. all over malaysia 🇲🇾 states is affected by massive flooding and yet thinkaporeans are still thinking about traveling to and fro to malaysia 🇲🇾 states. where are your brains 🧠 🧠 🧠  🧠 thinkaporeans living in red dot 🔴 majulah kita singapura 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬island 🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝🏝
those travelling to malaysia are mostly malaysians working in singapore who have not seen their families for long period of time. that is the main purpose of this vtl about; to let families or long distance relationship to be together.
"if there was a contraceptive vaccine. after taking it, you still needed to wear a condom, and you could still get pregnant.  would you still take it? yes people. it really is that stupid."
excellent analogy to wake up those deeply hypnotized by vaxxine snake oil salesman.
"with the increased and imported spikes in covid-19 cases, where did the omicron and other viruses come from? who brought them in? it cannot be the unvaccinated since they are not allowed to travel. hmmm... why are they discriminated then? &lt;i not stupid! lol&gt;"
then why allow vtl into singapore. all affected are coming in to singapore to aggravate the situation. disingaporeusting.
only complain complain please la pathetic
please la who are ask you all to go overseas now and now changes complain please la
"today do one, tomorrow do two, another day did three???? which to follow ????"
whats the point of asking people to take covid test before taking a flight if the infected are able to board the plane
"""............ but it is an essential and prudent measures to protect public health."" - iswaran sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore."
fk off la why vtl still need so many effing testing?! the new procedure makes no logic and sense. stupid govt.
"to live with virus or not......this is a really hard decision to make. while we are proclaiming to learn to live with the virus, we are not doing that."
not suprised to hear this
must close again 6 month singapore  much better and touris can not antry untill  1 year 2023
that's a very responsible and capable s'pore govt.
sheep
completed disappointed for such decision.
"""but it is an essential and prudent measures to protect public health."" - iswaran  sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore."
so singapore's government completely lied about living with covid as well. i wonder if their citizens want to shut off to the outside world or open up?
"can't stop omicron, only slow it a bit"
"instead of temporary shutting down the vtl when omicron was detected, we are now  paying the price due to our reckless govt. lucky the virus is less severe than delta otherwise there will be more deaths."
it will be the usual relaxing and tightening cycle to propel us into the new world order agenda.
well said. that's exactly their playbook from day one.
"the masses will be incepted into the matrix of the dajjal by leaving behind their culture, race, religion, caste, social status etc. that is the motivation we're experiencing now."
so during this period till 20th january are we still allow to travel out of singapore?
full flip government la want to open don’t want to open . kana sai
this guy is repeating the word ‘like’ dozens of times in this interview. he must have repeated this word million times a year . take this positive feedback 👌
"very observant. psychologically speaking, this kind of person is either seriously lacking confidence or in extreme case pathological liar."
don’t you know that millennium thinkaporeans in red dot 🔴 majulah kita singapura 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬 island 🏝 is doomed nonetheless. don’t bother to think about any revivals of the millennium red dot 🔴 singapore 🇸🇬 anymore. what’s done cannot be undone. millennium red dot 🔴 singapore 🇸🇬 is already hopeless and worthless. all the government wants is nothing but cash 💰 money 💵 true and factual
"this is quite ridiculous... open and close, open and close... if booster is so effective, why are we closing again? these knee jerk reactions are disruptive... as long as our leaders are not decisive, we will forever running in this covid loop."
exactly. just like a drunken man who lost his way couldn't get back home. keep wandering and looping with his bottle on hand at the liquor shop.
makes no sense ! million dollar ministers making billion dollar decisons.😣
more like making billion dollars mistakes.
we should welcome not stop😁
the omicron is very transmissible but it is not more dangerous than delta. don't panic.
nothing is certain yet... its just to avoid panic...
omicron still cause death
just summarising fm what you read in media?
"first and foremost, do you have a reliable test to identify it in the first place ? secondly, by taking all those tested positive while disregard that they are healthy with no symptoms of any sickness, that itself is against the fundamental principles of pathology. many people were misingaporeuided and misdiagnosed for cancer using those cancer marker genetic test. the same applies to pcr test as well."
ifyouhave any underlying medical condition...wellyouhave to pray hard to survive.
"its o,k can use sampan row to selangor, no need land or flight"
now having a booster shot every 3 months is a high possibility from 2022 onwards. my concern is...will we ever become addicted to the vaccines? will we have withdrawal symtoms if we stop taking the vaccines?
simple.  don't listen. don't comply. be yourself.
booster shots machiam apple iphone 1 to iphone 13.  akan datang.
"just my humble opinion. one third very much into it. one third follows the tide. one third very much against but as time passes, those one third in the middle would drop off either because they get tired of all this repeated jab or some unexpected events happen to them. and don't forget, the vaxxinated status automatically become invalid after 6 months. so who is on the winning side is pretty obvious. no matter how many variants appear in the world."
valid questions which they don't want to answer. taking vaccines so regularly is like the boy crying wolf all the time. we won't know what is the impact on our immune system. i have remained unvax throughout. can you? stay strong.. its doable. stop following their stupid orders
yes. that’s true. i agree with you completely leslie lim. to the morons from the pap union they only know how to enforce crap shit rules because their families aren’t affected at all. they have never even spare a thought 💭 about the commoners suffering here in worthless red dot 🔴 singapore 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬
it has been the pap way of governing
alot singapore citizens dont realize.that the pap government always pass laws and things go wrong they change.
"they are always on trial and error. like a person who fail his driving license test but somehow got it through some means. has no clue on the direction to any destination, no gps device to guide, just going round and round in circle.🤣"
no accountability.
hang tuah hastinapura good analogy. they lost their way. like a blind fold man.
"""............ but it is an essential and prudent measures to protect public health."" - iswaran  sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore."
"ya lah obviously, everything in this world is trial and error. if something go wrongyouobviously want to change to improve the condition, then what? just leave as is to make the problems worse? if you are any better thenyougovern urself lah i think everyone die alr."
"hang tuah hastinapura do you think the human race is already so smart at this age and we can prevent anything from happening? everything in this world is trial and error. what we are experiencing now is very new, it is not like the sars virus back then. no one in this world can play god, not everything is determined. we can only learn and improve ourselves through trial and error. singapore’s actions against this virus is already one of the best there is the entire world has to offer. if you are not happy then you are free to go to other countries where their leaders are much more ambitious and do whatever they think is right and end up killing thousands. governments can make mistakes, but their decisions are often well thought out with many people and there are more pros and cons, plus and minuses, and trade offs that we still need to consider, something that your little mind can’t think of before making that comment."
"""the government is simply the biggest corporation, with the monopoly on violence"" famous quote from elon musk. i think that certainly applies to pap government. just a corporation that single-mindedly focus on money at the expense of citizens. what the heck is all that rules and regulations for ? it's nothing but to make sure that no one escape from the net of being lab rat 🐀. of course when some rats died and when their own narratives working too well for their own benefit, they inevitably had to pull back again. that is the reason for all this on off on off. but think about it, they're destroying their own pap next generation as well. no proper schooling, saf without proper training for 2 years.....every day fooling people just go online. pap is in for s long decay and certain death."
"obviously some pappie lapdogs believe they had tremendous reserve that can last them for hundreds generation to come without even have to work, or ensure all spore citizens have gainful employment without all this unwarranted disruption in the name of covid, that is where their arrogance come from."
tis happen to the transit flight in the fis place y allow to transit????
"stop cross border travels, stops the spread. simply: ifyouknow of a place that has the virus, don’t go there. if ur there, don’t leave."
压力。。。。stress
mtf has failed again on the timelines of the execution. sloppy job yielding abysmal results.
no good
"omicron 5 weeks in uk, 20k cases and how many ""related"" fatalities again? just one? it's ok, close the world, jab little kids, how very proportionate."
aiya those who hungry to travel and looking for hell please don’t complain la .👏👏👏
"gibraltar more than 99% fully vaccinated + 77% boostered. cases spiking again. portugal, and israel are also on the uptrend for new cases. in a particular football team, there are a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated players, in the same training ground and same dressing room. given the same environment and time frame, some unvaccinated players never got infected whereas some fully vaccinated players caught the virus. there is no consistency to either the vaccines or covid-19 altogether. keep this in mind and lets observe further."
"while vaccinated may still get the virus, this is because it is not 100% effective. the vaccines are much more effective against preventing death or serious illness than remaining unvaccinated"
"mi p even so, enough data already showed the risks are also very very low for unvaccinated ppl, especially for generally healthy bodies. perhaps the urgent push for mass vaccination is to cover up the inconsistency i just mentioned above. i’m not against the vaccination so far if a person is convinced to take it. but the direct and indirect mandates are seriously unethical"
mi p 2 month account
"good observations. this is how all this lunatic pandemic of variants getting so much attention. instead of focusing on one self immune system, assuming every single person has aids and with that assumption forcing or coercing everyone to accept the experimental jab."
"​malaya harimau thats right. the media and govts have been turning our awareness away from ourselves. sadly this is a mountainous habit, that is to put excessive significance in the external perception. they are assuming ""everyone is infectious"" and made us forget about the abilities of our own immune system."
"you know what i gonna say right? just say ""boh bian one mah. lan lan one mah"" this will make you surrender to adversity and accept your fate"

i prefer the bus company to refund the ticket cost….…. hard to get the way back ticket from 20/jan/2022 onwards for sure……😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

"bbc news: the great resignation wave. millions of americans quit their jobs, saying they feel liberated and that the covid has shown there is more to life than slogging. this quit trend is spreading in canada and europe too."

countdown to tyranny 2022
"living with c19"" is ""mutation grounds for dummies"""
"this  virus has the ability to mutate into more harmful variants unlike malaria from nopheles mosquito, as the breeding grounds which can be controlled and destroyed. i am saying therefore, this virus must be treated with zero tolerant and human cannot coexist with it. for example, from wuhan virus to delta variant which have already killed millions. given time, the mutation may wipe out human."
"i am saying the usage of the word ""endemic"" is misleading singaporeans for others selfish gains while the elderly are dying everyday."
"as i have said long time ago, and it's proving to be correct; gambling over a ""theory"" that the va.xed will protect us? that's outright risky. endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure."
ttkoh123 you think covid can be eradicated like malaria or polio? hah
"c brtdgh firstly, go get a proper education in english comprehension."
"65 omicron covid cases detected in singapore. single party is unwise and dangerous."
"as i have said long time ago, and it's proving to be correct; gambling over a ""theory"" that the va.xed will protect us? that's outright risky. endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure."
"basically ifyouchoose and had to travelled through vtl, no need to complain, basically this is the post pandemic travelling pattern or sop, else forget about travel. visible fighting against invisible can and will never be easy. no human on this earth right now right here knows or can know how the next moment can be,  upon the mercy of the virus. unless really urgent and critical, don't waste time and money as inconvenience there will be."
the border measures against this virus are futile. we should not let this virus control our lives. it is endemic and is going to stay with us forever just like the cold or flu. i quickly booked my flight today while vtl tickets are still being sold.
"mi p now is pandemic, not endemic"
"these days when pap says ""effective"" i want to laugh."
"cop for the word ""effective"""
"singaporeans will remember the vtls despite the emergence of new variants. stop pretending and evading."
don't travel for frustrated visitors to singapore.😷
hahaha coming soon 4th booster on the way for adults 🤣🤣🤣🤣💉💉💉💉 this is definitely some kind of experiment already
active is preventive measures while reactive is waiting for things to happen despite worldly information.
"reactive ministers? vtl without quarantine is illogical anyway. also art seems also illogical as compared to the more accurate fisher scientific pcr test anyway, the question is the objective? what is the objective? cheap human lives or enterprise business more important?"
"regarding the drugs/vaccine, i heard goes thru tamasek [unless i heard wrongly]. my question is why cannot govt buy direct instead of passing through another middleman hand? though in words is own by government, but it is operating like a private entity enjoying profits and benefits and other rewarding remuneration. or you think they work for free or non-profit organization? singaporeans on the chopping board? do they have private investors funds manage by temasek? are the drug/vaccine one of such investor funds?"
"also, why award to termasek and not goes thru tendering process? and they will say termasek own by govt. but then salary cannot review or declare and secret. then they say is private. transparency or opaque?"
"that's why i said; no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine. it's simply is illogical in the context of citizens life-safeties. the virus mutate is a known fact. a modicum of senses would have erred on the side of citizens safety as priority. that's why i have been saying; single party is unwise and dangerous."

please keep selling the tickets. please send all of them back. then after that we closed the vtl lane so they cannot re-enter back.
meaning from 23rd dec till 20th january we can't travel out from singapore also??
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
good job close country two year to travel er untill covid 19 dispear
"living with covid-19: virus climbs up, we duck down and vice versa"
action should have been taken as soon as omicron surfaced.
"this is a nice ""ride"", so shiok??? open close open close. up down up down. on off on off. so song!!! http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wakeup#wakeup"
rational decision.
so everyone has to stay at home to celebrate christmas....
good n decisive move to ensure all are are safe.
what's happening to the high efficacy western vaccines ? a true baloney ? omg
boring
a bit slow to react and to curb the spread of omicron.. 🤦‍♀️
"don't freeze, people complain. freeze, also people complain.  singaporeans really love to complain. :)"
too late !   too little
why was i forced to take vaccination then 🖕
in light of the forecasted antcipated spread of omicron. mayhaps about 2 weeks too late to reduce the vtl flows & seeding incidents by a meainful degree. better late then never. hopefully we vaxx enough & boosted enough to do the trick & the reaction was unnecessary on hindsight.
"on, off. on, off. open, close. open, close."
omicron = moronic
so sad vtl on hold after things were looking up…wanted to visit seoul or istanbul….  singapore & malaysia should try form a bubble ..it’s only separated by a 1km walkway
unfortunately msia cant handle any epidemic nor natural disasters. else the bubble could have been formed long ago.
spaide man singapore is better in handling natural disaster. doesn't rely helps from neighbouring countries. singaporeans voted reliable political party as the government.
new scam in process. vaccine for what. get just heal. most die. 99.991 percent get ok
omicron already occur when the land vtl occur. and how stop ?
they didnt hold their nerve..so much for living with it.....good thing they can still draw their salary w/o fear of money coming in. rgl not brought back...how to run businesses...
use this comment as a dislike button
juz open the border.. no point
only ft will go take vtl. vtl for foriegners. not for singaporean. pap serve them
"of my friends and relatives here in singapore, 90 % travelling are locals. in particular travelling to countries with winter season, such a skiing in korea, i have not the slightest sympathy. seeing the own family, that i still understand."
peter kroll so ? why should a govt go serve ft ?
of course. have you seen pm lee facebook page? all the comments from his posts are praises from fts. this is what motivates him to wake up in the morning.
blizzaroxxx lol how do you even know?
next up will be the gyms closed down again
a very responsible decision by the capable s'pore govt.
"well done, spring cleaning before cny."

"just so you all know, african nations totally dismissed the ‘dangers’ of omicron and the numbers are going down. cna: the cnn of asia."
many poor countries also 'dismissed' the covid danger; as if nothing is happening.
"african nations also dismissed hiv, ebola, tuberculosis, polio, measles... c-19 is breakfast in bed."
god bless singapore
right move
open close open close open close. what's going on in their minds? didn't they learn a lesson after the outbreak?
"thank you cna for this report on the vtl situation in singapore due to omicron, from me and the gospel music ministry i serve in. also thank god, one of our recent songs ""lost without you"" fits in very well with the urgency of your report, this song i hereby dedicate to you and all viewers with fervent prayers for god's swift intervention to end this pandemic: https://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbghttps://youtu.be/bb4sxyoydbg"
singapore making the same mistake like the previous variants. then blame unvax.
nonsense
peter kroll no it not.
do you have any better suggestions? this virus is tricky and approaches must be nimble.
bs. no point when you still have vtl travel .
"what's the use for these "" 4g "" when even a kid can see it coming...import over local.."
why cant we just stop flaunting to the whole world that we have got everything 'under control' and than make a fool of ourselves??? when will we ever learn from  our mistakes? it is a no-brainer that opening checkpoint is a no-no at this point in time. why are we so impatient to show the world that we have that 'special formula' to break out of this pandemic just to go back in it deeper than before....spare a thought for the healthcare workers.
what makes you think it's for showing the world anything? your way of thinking is so skewed.
"rick his thinking is justifiable considering our sop kept changing from dining in groups of 2 to 5 multiple times. as soon as the cases drop, the government relaxed the rules and declared that it as an endemic phase only to tighten the grip again when newer variants are discovered. this trend of repeatedly going back and forth with the sop will continue in the future. they shouldn't rush and move in a steady pace instead"
violent cabbage that doesnt mean that the policies are made to show the world or to flaunt anything. policies change all the time especially in this pandemic which is very unpredictable. should any policy be rigidly unchanged despite the changing conditions simply to show that the initial policy was perfect?
rediculous they just don't learn or adapt the virus is less virulent and too fast to contain. plus people are vaccinated but treated the same as if vaccine never existed.
stay home is the best.
i think is abit too late ..that time discover first case of omicron in singapore must already stop the travel. some may had got omicron but without symptoms going out to eat and spread to others. with mostly haven’t got their booster shot is quite dangerous.
"this is a continuous relaxing and tightening cycle to transit us into the new world order agenda. anyway, be prepared for a cyber pandemic which will made covid-19 look like a walk in the park."
"should have happened earlier, and listen from all experts, but not only the western experts. or else omicron will be called ohmygod !"
"she is sitting in a high rise office building, you really think this travel companies towkays would feel any pinch if this safety measures is taken...!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is a virus emergencies....do you think government should give this towkays any leeways... offf course not.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"is this what their so called ""living with the virus"" looks like? 😂"
leceh peh!!!
"why am i not surprised?  just look at the active vtl (air) countries/regions: australia, brunei darussalam, cambodia, canada, denmark1, fiji, finland, france2, germany, india, indonesia, italy3, malaysia, maldives, the netherlands4, the republic of korea, spain5, sri lanka, sweden, switzerland, thailand, turkey, the united kingdom6 and the united states7 1including the faroe islands and greenland.  2including all overseas departments and regions (drom), overseas collectivities (com), overseas territories (tom), and new caledonia.  3the vatican city is an independent city state and is not considered part of italy.  4including aruba, curaçao, sint maarten, and all special municipalities.  5including the canary islands  6including the crown dependencies (guernsey, isle of man, and jersey), and all british overseas territories.  7including the us territories of american samoa, northern mariana islands, guam, puerto rico and us virgin islands.  among them, the covid-19 worst hit countries are on the list. smh!"

nice for opening 😊 i like singapore
"taiwan halts 2nd-dose biontech vaccinations for ages 12-17 amid concerns of myocarditis november 10, 2021 by george liao (cna photo) taipei (taiwan news) — central epidemic command center (cecc) head chen shih-chung (陳時中) said on wednesday (nov. 10) that a panel of experts has decided to suspend administering second doses of the pfizer-biontech (bnt) covid vaccine to children 12-17 years old amid concerns it may increase the risk of myocarditis. cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported after bnt vaccination of children between 12 and 17 years of age. according to u.s. statistics, the risk of youths experiencing myocarditis after receiving the second bnt dose is 10 times higher than after the first dose, cna reported."

"opening of causeway border is too much of a risk to take, controlling and handling the traffic volume with detail checks is highly impossible. hope government can seriously this decision, not creating another regret again. now with opening of various vtl and stabilising on local measures n system is already good enough and strenuous on the team, on the people. opening of causeway border is going to create a big bang to us again, all vtl all social measures for locals will be affected again..... singapore might still remain the vtl but other countries might not want singapore. we need a stable opening up, not a huge risk opening up, risking what hv been achieved 😔😔😔"
"when there's a lot of movements along the causeway, we know that there's no way it can be controlled. like it or not, quarantine is a must for all entry by land or even air vtl. in view of recent reports of a potentially more contagious variant of the covid-19 virus, i don't think either side of the nation want to take the risk just for short time access."
"the lancet november 20, 2021 volume 398 issue 10314 covid-19: stigmatising the unvaccinated is not justified in the usa and germany, high-level officials have used the term pandemic of the unvaccinated, suggesting that people who have been vaccinated are not relevant in the epidemiology of covid-19. officials’ use of this phrase might have encouraged one scientist to claim that “the unvaccinated threaten the vaccinated for covid-19”.1 but this view is far too simple."

our art kit  is like our vehicles prices. it is a few times of the factory price. what is the cause of this. why are we paying so much more. who is making money on the horrendous mark-up!
the factories that manufacture the art kits don't get their materials free. the carton the art kit comes in is not free.  the truck that transport the cartons out of the factory is not free. the store that stock and sell the art kits are not charitable organizations.
"thulomanchay freaking pea brain. just for an example,  those similar art kit is selling one quarter of the price in malaysia as compare those selling in singapore."
thulomanchay clown always say or argue anything to create a joke. some lie due to political ground.

my opinion is that it should be open for tourist and those returning home. not day tripper that will make it difficult to control. perhaps 2 to5 days minimum visit. hope wont return to pre covid nightmare going through the custom.
"malaysia cases still high, stupid idea to open the land transport for malaysia. and even our cases are still not stable yet don't bring in more cases!! stupid government !!! not time yet! don't take the risk.  can't imagine malaysia motorcycle coming in makings alot of noise again!! and  bringing the bad air pollution to us !!! ban malaysia motorcycle for coming in,  they're  too  noisy and bad air pollution!!"

how to get below 100 ? do another circuit breaker ?

chitchat maybe we should learn from sydney. they did it
sabrina c what do you think they did right ?
chitchat they locked down for 4 months straight until the numbers went down.
sabrina c so do you suggest we lock down 4 months or 4 years ?
chitchat lock down until the numbers are low as per my initial comment

mumbai hospitals witness 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks hospitals across mumbai are witnessing an almost 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks compared to the peak pandemic period in the second wave. guess what's happening in singapore hospitals  with 86% fully vaccinated.

"it is wrong to force the non vaccinated to receive experimental chemical vaccines like pfizer and moderna.  the healthy younger non vaxxed group do not pose any danger to the community.  leave them alone.  all your experts have been echoing only what pfizer and who say on paper, but did your local research teams validate the efficacy of the vaccines? if vaccines so effective,  why 3000 infection cases a day ? that's the elephant in the room!"
not just talk cock saying they already help singapore pls dont lock them they are human
let the f workers all out( all already vacinated why only 3000 daily let them all do daily life routine.

oyk and his bicycle. still going down slope after one week. wonder where he finds such slope that you still don't reach flat ground after one week. please don't try to be a smart alex. oyk probably came up with such name as circuit breaker. think of reaction before making any more analogy.
faulty brake bicycle going down slope in a dark tunnel with no light at the end !!!! smart ministers smart nation
oyk is considered the smartest among all the smart alec within the rank. his bicycle analogy hides the fact that he is actually an unlicensed driver of a bulldozer. the bulldozer he drove now mowed down many people lives. what's happening in mumbai is worth our reflection though few appreciate how serious the matter is. 28 sept 2021 - mumbai hospitals witness 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks hospitals across mumbai are witnessing an almost 50% rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks compared to the peak pandemic period in the second wave.

"sample sizes not large enough only in the context of singapore. i remember reading an overseas study where their results were different, and their sample sizes were larger than ours. i think that study was done in the uk, and it showed that p-p-p resulted in a marginally higher level of protection vs p-p-m, but the same level of increased protection was not seen in m-m-p. overall, the results of that study seemed to suggest that those who took p-p for their first two doses, would do better with a pfizer booster shot vs a moderna booster shot, while those who took m-m for their first two doses, would see no significant difference in protection regardless which booster vaccine they received. i don't remember the link as i read this back when singapore first announced the offer of booster shots. that was several months ago when the elderly were the first batch so i can't remember already."
"i think you’re right, talking of ppp, that’s why they’re using p as booster for pp-vaccinated. i am not sure with moderna though, i mean what options are available for them."

bmpcos as long as i'm a singaporean it will always be my business. being ruled under a bunch of clowns that do things without considering the consequences of their actions is indeed both worrying and frustrating.  how about you be the first one to go overseas for holiday (preferably the ones that are experiencing winter now to get the best effects of covid)? let me know if you get sent to the icu because of covid yeah? all the best!

check under expensive persian carpet  all there
update yourself please...
yes update yourself

evrything else can update..this 1 cant.. why?? think everyone will chk? especially the elderly. evrything do sure theres agenda.. not honest
they're don't dare to report if after reporting ppl die of vaccine then nobody want to go for it then they cannot open more borders too earn money 💲💲💲!
"snoopy the problem is when they don't report some will go to social media and get not accurate results or worse fake results. like the day before there were some so called "" unofficial "" sources that said that 90% of those who died are fully vaccinated."
no need…if they say ~ those died cos of preexisting conditions n complications are the ones who are vaccinated.  they are the best at play word.  all this play mobil politicians are waste of space.

"every 28 days about 90k over people are infected. in just 10 months, at least more than 1 million people would have already been infected with the virus. no wonder; singapore removed from eu travel list, may affect vtls - on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country, the eu said: ""they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid-19, as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources. ref: asiaone miw failed internationally? hide hr numbers, hide total accumulated numbers, hide vax / non vax? or what? bloomberg’s covid resilience ranking, singapore drop 20 places to rank at 39 even worse than africa. according to us cdc, singapore at level 4, very high risks of covid level/infection. r-rating [reproduction rating] is not even internationally recognized regardless how they want to ""re-invent"" the data maybe only can fool some 61%, you say?"
"always handpicking examples from other countries to meet their “i told you so”narrative. yes netherlands is reimposing some social restrictions, but that’s after giving their society 6 months of freedom and letting them enjoy life! and their restrictions are still nowhere close to as strict as the shit show we have here. this 🤡 show of a government hasn’t given its people anything close to a quality of life worth living… after these same people did everything that was asked of them for 2 years."

"ßpęřm  coe was designed not as a form of tax. more to control traffic. by the way how much is coe contributing to the revenues? do you know that spore is running a budget deficit for a very long time already? what we collect as revenues are not sufficient to cover our spending on defence, health, education, social etc i am in favour of raising gst to 10 or 12 %. it's a fair taxation"
"coshinc so you are elitist? only those who pay the most deserve to be treated equally? are you discriminating against the less wealthy? what kind of bigot are you?. coe may not be designed as a tax, but its a form of tax in my view and many peoples views. you can call shit chocolate and eat it too. gst is also tax. income tax may be paid lesser by the less high income earners but its still tax. or are you discriminating those who pay income tax but lesser than millionaires? someone should educate you better. so tell me, how much tax do you want to be paid by a person for you not to discriminate against?"

"you should say earning good money in singapore. many pr riding little motorcycles in singapore, back home they can own premium cars for cheap or own bungalows or landed for cheap. if not lucrative why would anyone endure the chore of crossing causeways regularly to work? nothing to do?"

"lisa lim your parents should fall into the counts for you to wake up your ideas to help build and push for a safer environment for everyone, especially the poor singaporeans elderly who are dying everyday and not malign others by convoluting life-safeties with politics."
lisa lim it’s never too early to prepare.

promotion of booster shots
"vtl is exciting but the more important thing is to set a target time for clearance per passenger. otherwise the queue will be very long with the excuse more checks is needed due to covid. the gov to gov should be able to share by now who has been vaccinated so there is absolutely no need to check these at custom again and waste everybody’s time. if security is a concern, treat all travellers as default vaccinated and only share bet gov for those who are not yet vaccinated. for the swab tests results, custom officers should check early before the passport booth."

"prof teo on the 19 nov 2021 said, ""but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate, i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources, because at this stage, the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening, given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore, many people who are infected will not be tested with pcr test to confirm, and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers. and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection, it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community. and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly, we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require icu care."
"bloomberg’s covid resilience ranking, singapore had drop 20 places to rank at 39 even worse than africa. according to us cdc, singapore at level 4, very high risks of covid level/infection. r-rating [reproduction rating] is not even internationally recognized regardless how they want to ""re-invent"" the data maybe only can fool some 61%, you say?"

good to see malaysian malays and indians coming back here 😏
all cheong in to do security jobs! guaranteed 3.5k in few years time. 10k ringgit! can buy nice car and stay in semi detached! woo-hoo!
are you jealous? why don't you try to do? no ability?
"basing on the data, i think either the miw is too complacent at the expense of citizens’ life-safeties, or they are only focusing on business and enrichment for a handful of people."
i will give those in the pmo this… they are indeed consistent in working for foreigners n foreign entities.  cheap labours vs safety of singaporeans.  since 70% of our economy is foreign owned…plus 60% of the country gdp is from the global market.  they will continue to gamble with our lives.

repeating the same falsehoods.
justfair are the death rate falsehoods?
a tan can you prove that they are falsehoods?
"let me ensure? ensure nothing basing on the daily infection rate and the number of daily demises, as we speak. these days, it's getting harder to trust anything from them."

"vtls and open gates to influxes but metered freedom, new coined up terms, more protocols and fines for citizens? that's not mitigation, that's mere illusion and croc-tears would you say?"

"lawrence wong said [26 jul 2021 in parliament] - “as we do so, we must expect cases to rise, partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level. also, as we open our border for people to travel without shn, we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time, but at that stage as you heard just now, [our main focus will no longer be on daily cases] numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus, they are much less likely to become very ill.”  [ note: capitalized words ]  lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there would be leaks from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “risk” because as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore?  and during that time, not many singaporeans were even vaccinated.  to make the matter even worse. mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew.  why must they keep importing from higher risk countries?"
as i have said yesterday; i think they will relax curbs for business context while implementing more protocols and fines for singaporeans.
please refrain from falsehoods and slanders

"mati ke cedera ke tu semua takdir ya benar, ianya semua takdir allah. jika itulah hujah yang kita guna untuk tidak mahu berfikir dalam hal ehwal dajjal ni, maka hujah di bawah ini adalah lawannya. naik motor dalam keadaan tidak bertopi keledar adalah amat bahaya dan semua orang tahu benda ni. jika jadikan ‘takdir’ sebagai alasan untuk tak mahu fikir kenapa kita kena pakai helmet bila naik motor, takdir boleh jadi kenyataan. polis bukannya selalu ada di jalanraya. sebab itu, kalau orang bertanya kepada kita “kenapa tak pakai helmet bila naik motor, bahaya nanti boleh mati?”  kita sepatutnya menjawab:  “takpe lah, mati adalah takdir tuhan”.  tetapi realitinya kita tak menjawab begitu malah kita sendiri pakai helmet sebagai langkah berjaga-jaga kerana takut mati atau cedera.  tindakan memakai topi adalah tindakan berjaga-jaga agar kita “tidak ditakdirkan dalam golongan yang tercedera”.  analogi faham ke? samalah juga dalam hal ehwal dajjal, berfikirlah untuk tidak tergolong dalam kelompok yang termakan fitnah dajjal."

am amazed at how our dear singaporeans still want to enter malaysia when the cost of just entering in and out already almost singapored$500 liao... and that's excluding the malaysians there that can't wait to rob the shit out of your money lmao.
"this restrictive mobility on human volume only encourages human traffickers to resurface again, just the same as contraband cigarette."
black market inevitable. govt is not clever by only providing so little entries. even if ten thousand on both sides it is insufficient. a modest 30000 will be more reasonable. however people are at the mercy of this cruel and heartless government will just have to be contented with whatever is been dished out. if the government is hoping for appreciation and gratefulness they are dreaming. only hatred and disingaporeruntled people on both sides of the causeway are waving their fancy fingers to celebrate this ugly gesture to their respective government in treating their beloved citizens. people are not human but digit to the both government.
may peace be with you.
bye bye go home ... don't come back.

"put your trust not in this world nor the things in it. it's not going to last. but lord jesus christ, the risen savior suffered, bled, and died on the cross for your sins. he was buried and rose on the 3rd day according to the scriptures! he is the only begotten son of the living god of the heavens and earth! he is the only way to eternal life. he bore your sins and wants you to come by faith and believe on him. repent of your sins and trust in him. confess him as your lord and savior. he's coming back to earth soon to gather those who have put their trust and faith in him alone. you don't need to fear  the end of this world he's going to judge evil people and those who refuse to trust in him. they experience god's wrath and they will be punished  eternally. those who trust in jesus christ are safe! he is our only hope.  no good person, good behavior or money can save you!!!  no earthly plan can save you!!!  only jesus christ gives you the chance to be born again through faith in him and security.  his gift of eternal life is free, but it costed him everything.  don't waste your chance to be free from sin and receive eternal life!"
"2 corinthians 4:1-18 [1]therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; [2]but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of god deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god. [3]but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: [4]in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ, who is the image of god, should shine unto them. [5]for we preach not ourselves, but christ jesus the lord; and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake. [6]for god, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ. [7]but we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of god, and not of us. [8]we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; [9]persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; [10]always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus, that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body. [11]for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus' sake, that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. [12]so then death worketh in us, but life in you. [13]we having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, i believed, and therefore have i spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; [14]knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus, and shall present us with you. [15]for all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksingaporeiving of many redound to the glory of god. [16]for which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. [17]for our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; [18]while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
what's your point?
whoever design omicron virus need to burn in hell

i think too troublesome and expansive just to jalan jalan in jb for a day.
hopefully the system goes well....
"bermunda  it will not be possible to eradicate the virus, it will remain for thousands of years, but acting in the right way. that there may be another occurrence of infections is the fault of the leaders of each state who allow, without any precaution, the non-use of quality masks and the moving from one person to another. this, as well as the stupid 2g and 3g rules were thought - without really thinking - that they are therefore useless, because many of the supposed vaccines are completely useless, that's because many of these supposed vaccines are only used for profit purposes, although they do not contain no real active ingredients against the virus, but only consist of distilled water and also saline solutions. the other vaccines, on the other hand, are products that have not been fully developed and insufficiently tested and, consequently, are harmful to health or even lethal. many people vaccinated with such substances believe they are immune to a corona virus infection, but this is not true, because with distilled water or saline, as with other sham vaccines, no immunity can be achieved, which is why many people are vaccinated. 'with sham vaccines they present the so-called 'vaccination relapses' and get sick with the virus. many of these 'vaccinations' – which number in the millions and pretend that so many people have actually been vaccinated – are completely useless and mislead even the heads of state and responsible epidemiologists, virologists and physicians about something that is not really there."

"to: minister ong ye kung  [open letter for immediate distribution] sir, i plead with you to follow the example of our courageous pm  (going against reckless experts) and do an immediate u-turn to save lives. every 3 hours, a singapore citizen may be dying from covid-19 from the lack of ivermectin.  the above is my sincere opinion as a fully registered medical practitioner, it does not reflect the views of my employer/s.  dr iw yang (m08851z)"

"hais... such a dumb rule. might as well allow back to 5 pax per table  despite of the household. either way we must not go back to 2 pax again. if we do, it will just show that the govt loves being wishy-washy."
if singapore don't allow dine in.  their citizen's economic will collapse.

"the relationship between viral dose and covid-19 severity: tulane researchers chad roy, ph.d., and dr. gregory bix --- this review found that the virus is primarily transmitted through the inhalation of particles containing virus    and that the ability of those particles  concentration of viral particles plus the length of time one is in  contact with those particles ultimately determines one's exposure. importantly, the team concluded that the viral dose, or amount of infectious virus transmitted from one person to another, does not appear  to affect disease severity. in practical terms, this means that an individual who inhales a greater number of infectious particles will not  necessarily experience more severe disease than an individual who is infected with a smaller amount."
thw easing is a freaking joke!.
so what when infected rate fall below 1 but death rates shoot up. 17 more deaths today.
it’s obviously a joke. the infected rate can be manipulated easily. less tests lower number. ownself affirmed ownself. pap mantra.
you fack with civilian's lives and now like that. maybe you should use the mouth wash given out in your mouth and on your brain.
tyranny will not have happy ending that's for sure.
yes when ppl not trusting them anymore.
not allow unvaxed people enter shopping mall is league?
did they say it's our choice to vaccine?!...but now all restrictions r focus on unvaccinated ppl! unacceptable punishment to the unvaccinated! this is too much!!
none can above law. us citizen already started sue biden.

you can't just rely on the infection rate - you have to consider the absolute numbers too. it's one thing if we have only double digit cases but now we're talking about 4 digits! so what if our weekly rate drops by 20% - we still have 2-3k cases which is a very high number for a population of 5.5m....

人在做天在看。。。 you know i know
you know i know all know
meanwhile in our daily moh reports we no longer dare to report how many unvaccinated patients died the previous day.
i feel some are related to vaccines complication.
because there are none https://youtu.be/1vujkgtinvghttps://youtu.be/1vujkgtinvg
"if there are evem one non-fully vaccinated, it will be reported."
"i don't live with my family and not vaccinated. because i am waiting for novavax, or the new pfizer oral drug which they said will be a game changer. i don't reject the other off label safe drugs that has been around for many years. i take zinc, d3, selenium, omega 3, quercetin and nac daily.  can't eat at the outdoor foodcourt is a big depressing factor to me. i feel like wasting time at home doing nothing, used to be busy before retirement. don't feel like visiting children too often too because of the virus. (food court are empty and cud separate a corner for 1 table 1 person for the seniors that is bored and going nut at home，very possible in old time spore) i used ozone and silver water to reduce the chance of getting the virus outside. wearing mask with copper that is known to kill virus. i find small 1mg melatonin to help the mood. also nac, passion flowers, l theanine, maca. i find having to pay for medical costs if i got covid is not entirely fair, especially if i got it from 85% that was vaccinated. the gov will be much more respectable if i were to pay 25% or 1/3. because getting it is not entirely my responsibility. even those vaccinated cud get it too, and passing the virus to those not vaccinated. i may just refuse medication if i got virus, why cure ? only if vaccination is at the same time for 100% which is humanly not possible, then the risk of mutations cud be lowest. so the unvaccinated sud not be discriminated esp they are mostly seniors who contributed to singapore for many years.  just my own feeling."

"5 from same household ok to dine in at restaurants, same as 5 foreigners ( probably not from same household but maybe same country) coming for bloomberg forum. a married couple can dine in at parents’ house but they are restricted to dine with their parents at restaurants. i wonder why?"
are you sure every country will send 5 delegates? …..bloomberg will more likely 5 participants from different countries sitting together dining and probably more talking amongst themselves than having food in their mouth. i think most restaurants will follow what they did last time …. continue to restrict all diners to 2 persons a table to be safe from violation regardless whether they are from same household or not. this rule hard to enforce and is a fail.

"sir :  from 10 nov , we r allowed to dine in of group of five from the same household or family in f&b outlet. respective f&b outlet to ensure their chk on these five members to be fully vaccinated. however, this does not apply to hawker center where we r only allow two dinning in. very confusing?  why not apply to both f & b outlets & also hawker center too? public will not be confused. by controlling the allowed tables of the hawker centre to a certain percentage  then it would not be sending mix info or feeling to the general public. meaning eg like 10 tables of the total 100 tables are allowed to hv five dinning in at these hawker center... while the rest is still allowing two sitting in. like a testing stage ...  the safety officer will still be going ard to monitor the situation still right ?  then the covid mgt team would not be question."

the vaccinated won't spread the virus?! anyone able to ensure?
keep your body immune system and internal organs free from toxins!!
"as grandparents , we are fully vacinated plus booster dose but still have chronic sickness to move around jw to punggol"
have it occurred to you what may be causing your constant sickness?
nothing for the unvax again? jesus help these people
got something for the unvaxxed now that is pay your own medical bills if you are infected  😁
yeah we used to call people unvaxxed and without covid. healthy normal people. now they are like lepers as the fully vaccinated with boosters keep getting covid.
they will go to heaven staring down at mtf
"i am waiting for my daughter, son in law with 4 young children between 1 till 9 yrs old to visit us at different estate...so far no changes for visits to household only 2 guest per household a day"
can meet outside ?
haha double standard task force!!! will pay the price of higher virus spike in due course. highest paid ministers who know nuts.
hi children come the clown show have started 🤡🤡🤡
<b>it</b> 🎈
boba fett yes very suitable 🤡😜
lmao accurate
"meanwhile in circuses everywhere... ""hi clowns come the politicians show have started 🐷🐷🐷 learn from our very best!"""
woofwoofchs 😂😂😂
our govt taken boosters shoots yet?
looks like need botox booster more 😁
"disclaimer- i live alone and the dining in does not affect me.  however i do know people who are not in the same family but are renting rooms in one hdb flat... so they dont look alike, not siblings, how to prove?"
when you live alone just mind your own business then bother about other people affair 😁
"with so many question marks on their policy only means one thing… it’s not a coincidence but an intention to push thru agendas that cannot be openly announced. no one is innocent, including the 70% voters giving their mandate."
"boba fett ok sure. do spread positivity, be blessed."
which gov in the world speaks the true to the citizens. poor citizen shake heads & listen to them or else no shopping no work no dine in  😂
i think its fair for the bigger good
nk gov speaks truth to citizens
play recorded music at f&b outlets? are they crazy? such a dangerous move!
the music is not necessary at all.. it just makes people speak louder and more moisture hang in the air
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
hamidah ahmad then why some funeral and parade can play music ?
why recorded music in f&b dangerous ?  virus will dance and mutate is it ?  urghhhh !!!
james lim lol nice.
😂 haha
for travellers. they like entertainment. look how european & american has started with concert and huge gathering( even w/o mask). think they give a damn what will happen to others ..🤣
alzario what about those open disco party without mask in wuhan last year isnt loud music being played there ?
hamidah ahmad do you live in a plastic bubble scared of your own shadow? jeez always wondered what kind of craven people would allow fascism to save their own skins at any cost now i see clearly what type that is.
😀
t 2017 what he said is true tho research was done last year that when one projects one's voice more droplets will be expelled tgt with virus
mark zuckerbird so recorded music can spit out droplets is it ?
jillybean jillybean recorded music funny is it ?
boba fett because people have to raise their voices to talk to one another be it recorded or live music.
mark zuckerbird people going to f&b to eat and not to talk loud so dont confuse yourself what is ktv and what is f&b ok.
boba fett you mean people only eat and dont talk while having meals? lol. delusional
mark zuckerbird so those diners eatimg with their mask on is it ?  how silllly billlly  you are.
"boba fett what are you talking about? you are drifting further and further away from topic. with loud music be it recorded or live, one needs to talk loudly to be heard whether f&b outlets or ktv. geddit???"
mark zuckerbird so that means music to be banned everywhere here it ?  so you mean people will talk loud only when recorded music being played ? go visit coffeeshop and hawker and gymn you will hear some loud stuff over there so now you are the one got drifted away from reality geddit ?
no comment on government is always right even they are wrong
🙈🙉🙊
vaccinated should not wear mask since mmtf claim they are protected n unlikely to die.
enemy of the state.
you mean the virus or the unvaccinated?
bmpcos mmtf.
bmpcos vaccinated. they are the super spreaders without knowledge of their own ability to spread because govt gave them false security
irene lim  let's name them fmtm
mark zuckerbird  govt did not vaccinated don't spread  get this right
bmpcos your broken english i dont understand
"bmpcos when you mean virus, im guessing its the authorities."
whenyoulive in punggol then you hv to take ur swab test weekly at irregular time weekly. that's so convenient. thk u! can tyouallocate hougang at least?
not enough medical personnel so need to deploy tactically.
so many dislikes. kiu
sinful mortal beings trying to revamp everything earthly by using the nwo agenda are eternally condemned already!! final judgement of god awaits you for your eternal destiny!!!!!!
"lol if there's a god, pretty sure he'll smite you first for toxicity"
nwo agenda !!    these conferences are merely a facade for the masses who are in deep coma!!
"more people vaccinated and more people infected and died, what is the point of vaccination? if residents are not vaccinated at all like last year but got very small figure in infection and death compare to the current situation, which you prefer? obviously, wrong vaccines are being used and wrong strategies and tactics are being applied is the main causes behind, look at hong kong, taiwan, mainland china, macao, singapore is the worst affected region with chinese government, shame on you pap, and now you shameless ministers trying to push responsibility and finding excuses some more, government should responsible for the death and the current serious situation."
wait till you see them target our most vulnerable children.
we have chinese heads but ang moh thinking
mark zuckerbird wrong  ang moh thinking isyouhave rights and nobody can forceyouto do anything  china thinking is must force vaccination  look at china they r forcing on children
lol
lol kl chan singapore doesn’t have a chinese govt  what ryoutalking lol
we are not part of china
djibicisse pity the people. pity the kids. but western is worse. they are hypocrites. say they are democratic but make people lose jobs and cannot go school if dont take vaxxcine. china is being evil upfront.
"the rule is simple, go to the toilet but cannot sit or squad, do it standing. ir you do it any other way we fine you. be prepare to pay, don't say we don't warn you. so please follow this simple rule."
stupid analogy
vaccine works? yes or no vaccinated person  the vaccine will minimised the severed of having  covid 19 ? yes or no   %  of singaporean how many % now? are we live with covid?
where is the easing of rules for unvax? no improvement?
"achilles, may i ask you something? since our gov cannot lead but always follow the u.s gov, can we, as citizens, also learn from the u.s citizens, to talk about human rights and protest? thanks."
aw deborah protest gets you jailed cuz pap
"achilles rodriguezxx thanks. then only pap got the rights to do n say? what about we citizens? nothing we can do? i mean our gov follow u.s gov n we citizens follow u.s citizens and we r wrong to do so, not fair."
they already going after the younger ones and already fired the warning shots with 2 new regulations taking effect from dec and 1 jan onwards.
that just means they have no confidence in the vaccine.
"pfizer sponsors all the major news networks in the us pfizer's credibility up to you to decide, but ask yourself 2 simple questions.  1. why does pfizer need to fund the news? 2. how accurate can media covered by the news be, when they are sponsored by pfizer."
f williams it is all about the money
slevin gaius bringing the young ones to firing squad too. so much blood on their hands
aw deborah us govt is our de facto leaders since we take instructions from them
ease for fxxk? to spread death?
yōkai 369 ignorant
mark zuckerbird funny coming from someone making multiple ignorant unproven claims in this channel.
"yōkai 369 funny someone who keeps bashing others without doing own research. i know of much info but cannot be bothered to show you. you are so rude, it would be good to be rid of you"
mark zuckerbird look at all the nazi queue scanning vaxpass. we sure act like we have been colonised
yōkai 369 vaxxed are also spreading diseases...
5岁至11岁，要强制打疫苗！如果对他们的身体有副作用，造成死亡！卫生部担当的起吗？为什么要冒这种险？ 现在辉瑞制药厂有出冠病口服新药，能降重症死亡率近9成。如果有人患冠病就去吃药，不需要打疫苗！ 如果要打疫苗应由他们的父母决定，有什么事，卫生部也不会被人们怪 罪！
"watch them on live only expecting more bad news than last, yet they talked like sharing great news to people? 🤔"
how did they get less than 1. change the demominator from 0 to 3000.  how long is this new 5 pax-form same family in dine-in - 2 days  or until 31st dec. !!!!????
it's all manipulation!!
indonesia reported yesterday 207 cases and 14 deaths. nearly 50% of the population are vaccinated.
indon and msia are doing well now.
vaccined or no vaccinedyoustill pay ur own bill
don’t keep open and close like chewing gum better open out singaporean already suffer enough we are not scare to die now we waiting for price increases. sian liao
tell it to the whiners.
death rate increasing. some things are not right.
icu bed fully saturated
"they are showing that, we are simply relaying on foreigners."
"yea you did , use your logic la , did you really think such small singapore will rely on singaporean that have proved to the world with only hdb complain phenomenon?"
bullying the seniors
peter chew the vaxxed seniors are supporting the g. not the stupid unvaxxed ones
other helping our airlines and airport the rest of the business and industries is punish. soon all these eating outlet is going be memories and bankrupt.
singapore airlines must not falter. lky legacy is at stake! <b>+9000 singapore social credit score</b>
"lky walked out of parliament the minute "" kate spade "" tin started to speak back in 2012. he knew then singapore is finished"
"are they sure it's safe to open up? in the past, there were 60,000 tests per day. as of last update, only 20,000 tests per day. fewer test means fewer case, does not mean the covid situation getting better."
indeed
test yourself. no country can have such resources to test so many people dailiy
"the icu n deaths will tellyouwhere the overall trend is. 17 deaths so it's going up, ground cases are closer to 5k "" 45-year-old among 17 more covid deaths, 2,553 new cases in singapore "" source - yahoo 7 nov'21 still pushing for boosters n vax the kids mr moh aka biz/econs major, areyouinsane  ?"
justfair it is not about the test but the statistics. they aren't even transparent. how are they going to convince others it's safe to open up.
positive cases using art test also not included in the numbers they report so actually not accurate
"vincecarlo you can also base it on infection rate. there are 15.9% positive out of 20,000 who gone for pcr test. in the past this was 0.1%. clearly the situation is getting worse. taken from google stats."
"des chan to make it worse, there are 15.9% positive out of 20,000 people who took the test."
"nothing new!  the same ""words"" manipulation. the so call ""experts"" is again use to evade responsibility and accountability. they are repeating, what they have been saying times over times. nothing  new!"
why singapore is not reporting the breach of data integrity in pfizer vaccine trial? south korea has already expressed concern publicly.
"they have invested in pfizer stocks, you think they will shoot themselves in the foot?"
"160 media "" hear only the good stuff """
vincecarlo  lol your comments are hilarious
i hide my test paper from my mom when i fail the test! so that no one know i'm lazy.
south korean are seeking justice from the murderers !
"colourful banana die,die,must push the agenda otherwise hv to put the gun barrel into their own mouths😰🤕🙄"
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
james lim  i will vote even more. thanks for the reminder
what has gun barrel got to do with covid? quite imaginative in the wrong way
justfair this pap government internet brigade dog is totally thickskinned
because lee hsien loong pap government is no longer in control of singapore. through ho ching the new world order has infiltrated and is now in full control of singapore. we are nothing but social and medical experiments now.
coz they don't want the stupid people to become smarter lol.
"just wait till the mandate comes for everyone to get their daily pfizer booster shots. ooops, not a mandate, sorry. you can either get the daily shot or not be able to step out of your house!"

justfair hey paw lum par..:} how are you doing? it's been along time since rock & roll. how is lhl fart lately?
james lim justfair is a paw lum par bro. now he even go smell oyk farts. every minister farts he will smell it and smell like roses to him. just look at his comments.:}
foghorn d  thank you for your small contribution of showing how an uneducated and deprived person post. too much pains and no remedies in sight. blame who? told you once before and they will tell you no more. what is it? education and ability. lacking one is bad enough. you owned two. congrats
justfair yes. i 'bo tuck che'. no study hard. but at least i know a fart is a fart. smelly. but it seems to all here that your master fart always smells like rose to you. hmmm..how could you tolerate that. i wonder :) could you kindly enlighten me.
"foghorn d  don't take the good times for granted for things keep on changing each day.  sorry it seems you have no good times, only bad times. too bad. wasted lah, why bo tak che?"
"justfair halo.. let your horse come over..' fang ma guo lai'.. just use colloquial english, no need text book-perfect english. after all we are asians. most of us use a potpourri of languages anyway. unless you are not a singaporean nor malaysian. justfair..fair enough or not."
"foghorn d  the tribal syndrome. different opinions mean someone is not singaporean. haha, quite scripted who says asians should not learn english? you want everyone to be like you?wrong does not cease to be wrong just because naysayers share it. grow up please"
"justfairdo yourself a favor. before you criticise others' england, make doubly - sure your own prose is accurate and faultless. and fair. understand justfair?"
foghorn d he lost his sense of smell because of covid
"justfair halo, you gabra already ahh? which ear of yours heard me say that just because you have a different opinion means you are not singaporeporean, huh? think you have a real problem understanding english. and who, pray enlighten me, says that asians should not learn english? but just because one has learnt and speak english doesn't mean we forget our asian culture. much less, strut around insulting people, branding them as being uneducated. that is arrogance personified!  sheer, unabashed arrogance.  wow, you are truly a major deluded dude! of course, i don't need everyone to be like me. neither should they aspire to be like you too.  cos it's people like you who gives singaporeporeans a bad rap overseas."
foghorn d  by your stupid comment that say i am not sporean or probably a malaysian. keep suffering and don't blame too much lah. i know you are suffering but don't blame too much. nobody can help you. and don't announce your pains here
justfair do you hear the people sing?
covid will get them soon
eases restrictions on foreigners but restrict own residents
"dear ministers, thank you."
卫生部应让已接种二剂疫苗的缅甸，菲律宾...的女佣可以直接进入国内工作，不需隔离！若还要隔离，那打疫苗就等同没打！
high risk
美国辉瑞制药厂宣布出冠病口服新药，可降低重症死亡率近9成。即然有新药，卫生部就让患冠病者去吃药，不需要强制没打疫苗的人去接种！！！ 应灵活处理，正如原本要在11月21日才开放堂食，现在又改成11月10日。 卫生部不应该强制不打疫苗者需自付医药费，对付税的人，尤其是为国家貢献一辈子的人，很不公平！强人所难，天理不容！ 未接种者有很多因素：因自身的健康自己清楚，恐惧因朋友打了疫苗死了！人命只有一条！将来有什么副作用？心肌炎，血栓，打了疫苗也会患冠病...... 若发生以上的问题，政府会赔偿吗？ 强制人民去打疫苗，是轻而易举的事！但是强人所难是天理不容！要做一个明君，不要忘记初心，人民有自由的权力！要对他们公平！才会受人尊敬！请三思而行！
shd not ease so fast till cases are low.why mp keep making things difficult fr unvaccinated ppls ??? not fair !!!  infection can be spread fr vaccinated ppls. pls give understanding to the unvaccinated ppls who hd no choice at all !!!
"if you want fairness, then go and get vaccinated. infection can spread from anyone, vax or no vax. no choice? your own guess? medically certified?"
irene soh     they hv turned heartless
"how long will it take for the cases to go down? lockdown is the only way to get the cases to go down but for how long?? then when they ease the measures, goes back again. then what’s the point?? it’s endless already la. covid is here to stay. just face it"
summer gal so big pharma is now the ruler?   colonized by bug pharma

f williams they have always been the rulers since a century ago
summer gal what kind of vaxx-cine requires unvaccinated people to vaxx-cinate to protect the vaxx-cinated people?
mark zuckerbird it's like someone bought an umbrella but they need us to buy one to protect them from the rain lol
moh must ensure that places like non air con coffee shops are well ventilated .. and air circulation.  as far as aircon premises .. there should be some clear guidelines.
"you mean all big malls, theatres and supermarkets?"
"soo tuck choong the important thing is that there should be air movement .. turbulence ... so that particles are dispersed and diluted.. when people cough, sneeze or talk loudly ... to dilute the particle concentration."
"talking for so many months, yet everyday still seeing thousands of covid-19 cases, really unbelievable!"
"not months,  its 1 year 9 months"
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
no better improvement
bravo to the task force for opening up in a cautious manner.
so 👍
👍👍
"""5 fully vaccinated members of the same household""  means that they can bring their maid for a dine-in."
in the other news  : 5 total strangers can dine together at bloomberg new economy forum in nov. discrimination at it's finest.
vincecarlo  this one different it's all about big 💲💲💲👀
boy or girl  two kids maximun ifyouwant to bring maid.
the government should have ensured booster shots were rolled out to more people before they start opening up.. this would have given more protection to those whose vaccine had waned esp in those people who are elderly or who had comorbidities and helped to reduce the severely ill and deaths. on balance i think the government was hasty resulting in unnecessary sufferings and deaths.
if main vax doesn't help why are you suddenly feeling that boosters   make all the difference? can't you see your own blindness here?
do you really think these boosters work?
"please also realize that many die / suffer permanent injuries from boosters due to ""preexisting conditions"" daily too. these are not reported!"
check out vid by geert vanden bossche insidious face of pandemic variants and you will see why boosters and vaxx-cines are harmful
"let's face it... whether you like it or not, the peasants cannot do a thing about it.  the elites will do what is necessary to grow the economy even at the cost of a few peasant lives (5500 per year at the current death rate).  so it is up to the peasants to protect themselves.  some peasants are still not wearing their masks properly and even chatting on the trains and buses.  these peasants deserved to up lorry !"
if they say the moon is square they make sure we say yes
thats how sheepo your beloved island is.
you are the only one to think that way . you know why? you are a yakkers
5 total strangers can dine together at bloomberg new economy forum in nov. discrimination at it's finest.
bmpcos and you are yakking to the yakkers. so it makes you a yakker too
talk this talk that by end of the day still want tp earn our money hy finding fault n fine us
follow the rules. no need to be fined
need to open to bangkok and bali also .. than more tourist will come to help boost tourism
why not?
talk like cases 10 or less. open up so more n more cases target hit 5k la
stabilise.?  better position? everyone of us knows at least 1person or 1 whole family  who are covid http://positive.you/positive.you  walk the ground then you know .when the healthcare system got  tired blame the ppl not the policy. sigh………………….and keep saying we are getting better. you should pat your own self on the back
i don't know anyone in singapore who had it before..
i don’t know anyone got covid
"rip seniors, you voted them in, kept them in power and now they leave you behind."
the irony ... hahahahahahahahahahaha
many seniors gathering downstairs playing checkers without masks….they don’t care.. they want to live life
brutal truth  well said. these false concens are almost laughable.these are the ones who are scared
"more people vaccinated and more people infected and died, what is the point of vaccination? if residents are not vaccinated at all like last year but got very small figure in infection and death compare to the current situation, which you prefer? obviously, wrong vaccines are being used and wrong strategies and tactics are being applied is the main causes behind, look at hong kong, taiwan, mainland china, macao, singapore is the worst affected region with chinese government, shame on you pap, and now you shameless ministers trying to push responsibility and finding excuses some more, government should responsible for the death and the current serious situation."
"brutal truth 68,000  seniors insingapore unvax...you are not alone.🙏"
joe kerr wanna say they deserve it but hindsight is 20/20.
minister :youmean foreign worker are stay in same hsewhole also allowed right ( if the stay together and same address???)
"those seniors who still live till next ge, be smart(like new generation) to vote more capable representatives. 😆"
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
teo boon wah see what happen on eve of deepavali when mtf give leeway to them? they crowd at the side of the road like nobody business. and how do we know if many didn't wear mask. smart decision by mtf. 🤣
meanwhile albania says life is normal there with hardly any change from 2018
"kl chai to achieve their target, they can keep blaming others so that they are always right. blaming the unvaccinated for spreading the virus and ignore the fact that vaccinated spread the same amount of virus too! ignore the fact that number is much higher now before we are vaccinated."
<b>am confused now cos during parliament house meetings all members  will have to wear mask when they are not speaking but why such rules are not adhered in this mtf briefing ? why is this so ?</b>
because they need to lick the nwo feet before and after this talk🤡
because the virus is dangerous only to the peasants and not politicians or celebrities on tv shows
"one rule for me, one rule for thee."
madhan “rules for thee and not for me “another way of putting it across 😰😷
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
"they are the kings, don't you dare to question!"
asara haeh king kong ? 😁
coz they are the boss n we are juz a normal ppl...they can do n will do everything as they like...haiz what to do🤷‍♂️

"it’s like how the smart virus is able to kill betw 10-20 person each day, now already trained to recognise who not to infect. so hard for me to believe those stats these days."
bernard ong our brains are all not immune to inconsistency anymore.
dirty lousy liars and hypocrites. you only eased up because of the increasing backlash about your double standards for the bloomberg forum delegates. total strangers whom you allowed to dine in groups of 5. lousy hypocrites lee hsien loong pap government
"mtf...well done n keep going!🤩🥳 296 need oxygen + 134 in icu = 430 cases not alarming, the rest are asymptomatic n mild cases won't die have recovered or recovering✌only spore is reporting daily other countries dont bother to report after vaccination😂 thz for the update n appreciate..👏"
well said.our govt is transparent
bmpcos haha 50% transparent
my world  50 upon 50 is full marks
vaccine is not 100% they know but they refuse to accept the reality
between a rock and a hard place we are....
we are stuck in the mud  😁
wrong  61% voted to be screwed
"boba fett in cement, you mean.😜"
boba fett quicksand more like it😭
puthu said that measuring immunity level is not relevant... or he meant not important?  which fake medical university he graduated from?
strange. the opposition are very quiet. all at sea. taking notes. i expect the coming election to be lively & very bloody. all pap mps. the safest ward is tanjong pagar. try to persuade mr.. chan to swap places. but mr. chan can't be that willing to prove himself.
in line with promises when ratio becomes 1.
"since when did stupid comments ever make a difference. shuddup n follow, ok?"
<b>define stoopid comments please and its never nice to shut down others</b>
"after giving 4k as ‘pittance’ money to our healthcare workers - which can only be credited in december, they have now decided to tip them further off the cliff. no wonder we are ranked 100 in the covid 19 recovery index with indonesia and malaysia ahead of us. the ‘leadership’ lacks empathy, direction and is clearly discriminatory against the unvax. where is the transparency in reporting numbers? hiding something?"
rubbish
hope ong ye kun and kenneth ma will be thrown to jail soon. these son of beaches now wants to push kids for the vaccine when there is not even 1 single death cases among kids 5-11 years old in singapore. how to even justify the risk benefits ratio?
why are they all not wearing masks when not speaking??
they are robots immune to covid.
because they are all hypocrites with double standards
they are elites... elites do not wear masks when speaking.  only peasants have to wear masks...
"mask is just precautionary measure ,.. look at ang moh countries… full house stadiums singing & cheering standing side by side each other maskless"
they need to lick the nwo feet before and after the talk thats why dont need wear laaaa
brutal truth  well said
brutal truth i know but can you see the double standards? there you are asking people to wear masks and failure to do so will lead to $300 fine. but here you are not practicing what you preach. how to take them seriously?
andrew lim bcos 61% voted for them. errr
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
it's hard to breath and they know it
as we all know how effective masks are especially when viewing formite transmission compared to air vector. but hey keep doing as your told and watch as your owners do what they want.
james lim whatever you vote wont decide who is in power. their puppet master nwo the one to decide. not only in singapore but everywhere in the world. wanna be free from them? then risk like war in mid east🥴
hmmmm....next election will have mail-in or vote online options... for election integrity....
just like how joe biden and the left wing liberal democrat liars stole the election
singapore pap government used the same dominion machines
two fools spotted
andrew lim bingo!
bmpcos it takes one to know one.even a fool who don’t open his mouth looks wise.
dolly tan  haha you just did 🤣  opened 2 times
bmpcos typical pap government internet brigade dog. thickskinned bastards
andrew lim  haha nothing better to say? wp and sdp approved all that the mtf are doing  isn't it sad?
"opening up = disturbing the equilibrium, i.e. an endless cycle of cases ☠"
do not vote pap. do not vaccinate your child.
what equilibrium? haha. what equilibrium? kick these clowns out and theres a chance we'll get closer.
not anti-vax but waiting for the novavax vaccine.
"in hokkien is  "" wait long long "" in the other news  : pfizer jab for kids"
"many unvac are waiting for novavax. unfortunately, this govt does not care enough for   its people."
honest query! why novavax?
pfizer first-quarter 2021 revenues is an astounding $14.6 billion  year will close in excess of $60 billion. amazing isn't it. temasek-led investor group in $250m vaccine bet on biontech. wife of pm is ceo and executive director of temasek whyyouthink they are pushing for pfizer mrna on national program; booster 3rd jab n for kids ? 💰💰💰🤑🤑🤑💰💰💰🤑🤑🤑 cha ching cha ching
same here. unfortunately cant hold out any longer due to the happy new year ruling.

slevin gaius hold on longer. these vaxx-cines got lt side effects major illnesses like alzheimers parkinsons etc
mark zuckerbird i would like too if choice was given but it's a top down regulation. the cost of pet is worth a days wage.  and the option to be fired from company by hr is already in play if compliance is not met.
"slevin gaius have you tried looking for alternative employment in the meantime? your health and life is worth much more. once you take the poison, it is a point of no return."
mark zuckerbird you do realize that this will be enforced island wide right? it's only a matter of time.
slevin gaius there may be some compassionate employers. mtf said fire as last resort. some will use this as excuse to get rid of certain employees. but perhaps there may be some who will show compassion and hire unvaccinated people and may those employers be blessed
"mark zuckerbird not worth it imo. catching the virus and landing in the hospital will incur financial troubles. and its getting difficult to move around.  personally i wish governance didnt have to resort to such measures if their words were ""encouraged"". it is what it is."
"slevin gaius vaxx-cines got lt side effects that are even more costly to fix. alzheimers is one of side effects and recently a drug was approved for emergency use for alzheimers that cost 56k. for 20 years no drug approved for alzheimers. but they know vaxx-cine will cause alzheimers (1 of major illnesses caused by vaxx-cines). so, they quickly approve drug in time for vaccinated people who will get alzheimers soon"

brutal truth depends on which sector and industry you talking about. only few are affected by non-opening of vtls
need open up allow foreign workers in not just open for vtls… due to shortage of workers govt stop issuing new tenders until workers situation improves…  by apr 22 some of my colleagues & workers will be out jobs already as their old projects are in final stages

dont throw away your masks yet!
omicron is an anagram of moronic 😝
"singapore govt is strange.  when its time to make quick, decision, immediate action.  they are silence.  this omicron virus is highly contagious, it has shown to replace variant d quickly in some countries.   it has mutated 32 times, making existing vaccines ineffective. fully vaccinated were the carriers n spreaders.   immediate action needed to curb entry n quarantine,   they sit on it hoping for miracle.   if omicron ever enter singapore,  it will spread very quickly and is not the bunch of highly overpaid incompetent can manage"
"if the government can prevent omicron variant from spreading to singapore  then they have at least  redeemed themselves.  but i doubt it. their track record is not good ! ""jerusalem, nov 27 (reuters) - israel on saturday said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country, making it the first country to shut its borders completely in response to a new and potentially more contagious coronavirus variant, and said it would usecounter-terrorism phone-tracking technology in order to contain the spread of the omicron variant."""
"haha opening more travel bubble  will perpetuate more spikes, as the new virus nu is more contagious  than delta. nu will not give a damned shit to what our  virus task force may think as pap is  always  reactive but not proactive. a proactive approach is to close out borders now instead of letting it  remain open. look at what china did recently when the whole world wanted to take the endemic path but instead stuck to their zero virus policy. the only reason i can think of is that china  being the originator of the first virus spread and have already found better  ways to contain it and that they cannot be complacent and rest on their laurels  but always be on high alert aginst any new strain  which is the hallmark of a proactive govt unlike  the pap getting fat on their salaries and just following the american/european ways of handling virus issues  with emphasis on vaccinations  which to them is the cure all against virus spread. good governance calls for being open to alternative medicine  to solve virus issues which none of our task force have that aptitude to take corrective steps even they may be wrong in their initial prognosis. vaccination programmes will only benefit big pharma companies with $ signs and i doubt will solve the virus issues.  now is the best time to work on alternatives instead on hyping on the benefits of vaccinations."

as a lot of countries is pulling back traveling. our ministers is still promoting it. putting the our country into the highest risk. we know now that the new omicron is very highly affectionable and is immune to the vaccine available. can we start to recall our vtl?
and because of our governments greed. new variants enter singapore. they are really only thinking about their own wellbeing. it's time for a change no more corrupt officials and that particular family that controlled singapore for centuries.
"can we invite someone with a medical background to speak on the new variant? the focus was completely off for me - with this new variant, what seems to be the concern here is the impact on travel. that is not having a big enough worldview. what about the impact on our society, healthcare and our people as a whole?  i came here to find out more about the new variant. didn’t expect to hear some stats on travel."

"the only sure thing is if people themselves are responsible, thoughtful and proactive."
"the rich is not rich enough.  need a new variant to transfer more wealth from the lower and middle class (taking from their small pensions and forever print money and low interest that the rich can afford).  feel sorry for  rich people, doesn't own everything! the shameless global politician following the rich instructions."
that's the very nature of globalists. it's all about 2 things. one is gaining all the wealth and power over the world. two is fearing that they may lost it. so they need to constantly create more fear and strive among ordinary people for them to succeed.
"ms mawii’s friend went to a 24-hour clinic after getting a lump on her underarm area, which allegedly appeared after receiving her covid-19 booster shot. however, when the patient went to see a doctor and tried explaining her pain, the doctor reportedly didn’t listen and said, “your english is so poor, which country are you from?” conclusion : never go and see a doctor for post vaccination injuries."
"and they think just bcs they speak better english make thm great n trustworthy. the main concern here is the patient's concern, nt english. moron"

congratulation singapore for letting malaysian worker home then close the cause so they canot came back to work no more dollars only ringgit canot proud already😂😂😂
but many africans in thailand cos many flights between thailand and africa..sure to open??
la
his strategy?  what strategy? he is simply  increasing the risk factors.
"singapore should not start the travel so fast,  once the deadly come to singapore it will be  worst affect. the only worry is the front line people. traveller or citizen  coming to singapore should shn at the destinated hotel for 15/20 days. for singapore citizens they should not shn at home. if you want to travel then you must think of those living in singapore."
cant escapee frm the unseen enemy.
"please include philippines also. we are so super stretch, drained and stress away from our family. i hope you compassionately consider it."
"omicron is mutated 32 times ,  thats making existing vaccines inffective and useless .   it is highly contagious, several times worst than d variant. if it hit singapore the spread will be quick n unstoppable.   it is irresponsible to ignore new variants and continue to open up freely."
"they are welcoming omicron into singapore !!!   when they screw up,  they will push the blame and punish  singaporeans.  they never apologize, resign or take responsibility n accountability!!!   thats dictatorship system !!!"
singapore so small.  one  mth omicron sapu all.
more vaccines are being developed and produced...just to convince people worldwide that these vaccines are effective and are needed to protect people against corona virus... at the same time scare everyone of the discovery of new covid variants here and there... yet another sly tactic to market the vaccines to make money...
exactly. that's the very nature of globalists. it's all about 2 things. one is gaining all the wealth and power over the world using virus and vaxxine as excuse. two is fearing that they may lost it once their ruse is exposed. so they need to constantly create more variants after variants which is nothing but only fear and strive among ordinary people for them to succeed.
"more jabs, more mutations.. endless boosters till you collapse.."
just open lah to foreign country so bored no foreigners here
no need to worry
a bunch of incompetents
incompetent yeah
upto 500% more infectious than delta.

singapore: welcome omicron! we would like to sincerely welcome you to our country. here you are exempted from any taxes and are free to roam.. if you get what i mean! hope you enjoy your stay!
singaporeans just can’t wait to welcome to the new variant.
sarcasm for?
"just like d variant,  the only means for new variant to enter singapore  is from external.   only those who has the power to do so can welcome new variant.   not singaporeans!"
when they screwed up (failed to block d variant entry)  they blame and punish pple.   nv apologise.   truly incompetent!!!!!
des chan really? they supported the system that economy over lives and thus responsible for the virus!
"des chan if you must know,   the present lot of government will never learn! just wait till january, we’ll be back to square one again. too many people in this country are too selfish, self centred and ignorant to know any better."
they will come without invitation.  no need to welcome
des chan incompetent yeah😅🤣
"new covid variant have likely reach singapore, will know in two or three weeks time."
a flight from sa to holland yesterday was found to have 39 pax who were infected.   this virus is reported to be 500% more infectious than delta.

"everybody travels for a different reason out of necessity. some are forced to travel by their bosses. many are returning home. malaysians come for employment. with 27 vtls and no quarantine, singapore is just a melting pot for the virus to mutate. no sane tourist would come here for holiday at this time as vacationing is meant to be a pleasurable experience. meanwhile our mmtf is inviting deaths from all over the world without quarantine. not only are they showing us they do not care for singaporeans, they don't care about the rest of the world too. you come. you go home. you die. not our problem. so, buyers beware. please come party in singapore. and don't forget to bring your own version of covid 19 as you would your 12 year old johnny walker."
tim loo1 do you really understand what he is saying???
tim loo1 never mind. no need to waste time.
boosters...here i come.
omicron is coming ! oh my god !
only covid ends the world will be normal tis vtl all useless . traveling means happiness tis vtl traveling must travel with covid in the mind
it's ok. the mmtf will safely import in the latest newfangled strain from all over the world as a leading aviation hub 👍
yes we will live with them. it's perfectly normal
good to vent some frustration here. to have some control in this scale of challenge

if the nu variant is not serious. the world stock exchange would not reacted to it with the bearish mood. moving into a big slip.

in a rush to open borders to so many countries almost all at once. risk of losing control of the situation will definitely increase. singapore is such a small country...where is it going to get the resources needed to properly manage the situation?
we are a rich country
yes.. the big big risk is losing control .
every country will get this virus eventually
we do not want this happen in singapore but they want what can you do? nothing we can do right?
the big problem is that we are snall and overcrowded. secondly too many people coming in and leaving.
fiost delta and now omicron doesn't care whether you are rich or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssvem6uogec&t=0m15s0:15 exactly how i look each time i get my nose poked
sure there are some ahole will misuse the vtl bypass and spread the virus...
what happen to the dislike?? is ytube controll by the f... king pap s'pore govt??
please believe whatever st says they have absolutely no conflict of intetest. they are trustworthy arbiters of truth. they have not a sliver of biasness and are a shining example of free speech. they report as it is without an agenda or a narrative. yes! its true!......  take my word for it.

govt didn't procure yet. perhaps one more booster might help?
fiost all vaccine makers are currently testing the effectiveness of existing vaccines against new mutant. it might take around 2 weeks. there is possibility they might tweak the chemical content of  current vaccine to account for this new variant.
just in time for christmas. based on gdp and equality

wow stella i’m really having trouble understanding what you are saying. maybe express properly?
bryan wang a scam! clear? 🤣
wuhan virus started of this plandemic you still haven’t catch the ball 🤦🏼‍♂️
teenage <b>mutant</b> ninja turtles
new strain in africa and african lion? i urge not to use the term african to avoid some from misperceiving racist remarks. we should can the new strain mutant x. that older strain found in india we also call it south asian right? so we must continue to welcome and support ceca
its only a matter of time before the new variant gets in through a vtl
all the variants travel by airlines.
absolutely true and no cause for alarm. every country including china will get it live as usual and get vaccinated
fiost 👍
"i hope for once the singapore authorities and medical experts are ahead of the curve to proactively manage the advent of the ""nu"" variant because the vaccine may not work as well ....for one, vtl from the uk should be modified with some form of supervised quarantine as this is a country most exposed to travellers from the african continent ...."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssvem6uogec&t=0m17s0:17 you see! he is in pain!!!!! which dumb doctor came up with this torture method to test covid?!?!?
"cannot close border forever, if planes go bankrupt people can never travel ever again."
"okay, let anybody who wants to travel, travel. anyone who scared covid just self quarantine at home. problem solved!"
exactly. already a better solution than the mmtf.
"the guy who wants to travel, is the problem, dude. the new variant will come into singapore from changi airport."
"thulomanchay dude, there will always be new variants. the virus only becomes weaker with each variant, never stronger by any standard."
best solution ever.
meanwhile the unvaxed can't even earn a living.
"woofwoofchs  oh yeah, this is what robert bollinger, md, john hopkins medical says: ""bollinger explains that it may be more advantageous for a respiratory virus to evolve so that it spreads more easily. on the other hand, mutations that make a virus more deadly may not give the virus an opportunity to spread efficiently. “if we get too sick or <b>die quickly</b> from a particular virus, the virus has less opportunity to infect others. however, as we have seen with delta, more infections from a faster-spreading variant will lead to more hospitalizations and deaths.” (emphasis are my own) the virus become weaker because more people die and the virus has less opportunity to infect others! great."
"thulomanchay actually, if you look at dr steven quay's lab report during the hearing at covid gop conference, he mentions that with each mutation, the virus becomes weaker, never more effective, that includes the rate of transmission. the chance that it becomes more effective is less than 1% even through very clever used of 99.5% optimised forced combinations of the covid hotspot gene code sequence is almost impossible."
woofwoofchs its true the other way too...it just need to combine/mutate with another to make it more transmissible/more deadlier..shrugs.
woofwoofchs bruh that's untrue...
"auyong ah meng did you watch the hearing? even if its done cleverly under perfect lab conditions with multiple successes, and not a single failure throughout several years, its still 0.1% chance aka almost impossible for it to be more transmissable or deadlier."
"avijeet well, tell that to the doctor who presented his work and lab studies at the covid gop conference. the guy has been working on covid since sars, is unbiaised, & has one of the best credentials with regards to this virus."
"it’s not in yet. it will spread like wildfire since it’s new. please dun use one key for all locks. it’s not going to work, my 6 year old knows that"
we will use many keys and many locks. get vaccinated is one key or lock? ask your 6 year old
"fiost for yours, we use one lock and one key. however we throw yours into the sea. end of story."
is just a matter of time. 😢
it will come here eventually.  be prepared
"yeah right. so by introducing vtl in singapore 🇸🇬 changi airport, delta variant clusters won’t mutate right ?????? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣seriously!!!!!! naive and gullible thinkaporeans in majulah kita singapura island 🏝🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
lion also kena swab test ah? xd
"most likely, they sedate the lion and in his sleep he is in pain like the man in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssvem6uogec&t=0m17s0:17"
🤣🤣🤣
"a responsible, capable and cautious s'pore govt. bravo!"
cheers. you are a positive person great role model
lions having covid is sooo wrong.
"yea, considering from who they got it from."
"vaccinated all the animals, so there protected from the asymptomatic humans with breakthru infections after vaxed."
govt should start preparing for hospital capacity to be ready for this. being more severe n immunity to vaccines would mean stay home recovery would not be possible
"we dun even get delta, so no worries."
delta is scared of our whining
clicked because alex karp is in the thumbnail
"so now the spike protein has been improved and made 100% more lethal, knowing that the virus was never isolated and thus lab-manufactured. welcome to covid 2.0 upgraded version."
"we can't lockdown forever.  how many kids are depressed? how many small businesses were destroyed? how many domestic violence or unspoken unhappiness? people be virtue signaling that they care about the little people while they work from home and order foodpanda, mcdonald's, and all the other big companies. long term repercussions.  we are f**k**. globally, this is not good. incase people don't want to hear the cliche 'inflation'.  we all will own nothing and be happy eh?"
they expose us to the virus then they punish the unvaxx.. nice...
safety is just a word only
so is fear
"why only from sunday? should be closed to travellers from those 7 regions immediately. it was first detected in mid-nov and one infected traveller each has already gone to hk and israel as of today. who knows how many they have already infected by now. if the target is to prevent entry of the variant into our country while more research is done, then border closure to these 7 regions should be done immediately. the worst factor is that the four cases found in botswana were all foreigners on a diplomatic mission and have all already left the country. diplomats! they could have gone anywhere since....and might even have been accorded special quick access based on their status as diplomats."
time difference?
"and so we roll the dice again, hoping against hope that we do not find disaster at our door once more. i am keeping my fingers crossed."
"nothing is free. when something is free, you are the product."
yeah that’s true indeed. absolutely right. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
the product is either good or bad depend on the materials
"fiost in ths case, it's bad material.. so, bad product"
maria maria  the material is you. good or bad?
"fiost ifyouadmit tht ur bad, thn ur mad. same goes to marketing products.. especially whnyouforce n threaten people to get it.. then ur really really bad n evil!!"
maria maria  marketing is different. no money can't buy. vaccines no money can buy
fiost nothing comes for free.youhave a price to pay fr evrything especially when it comes frm the garment
now being a human have to live on jabs booster to keep  them alive just like robots have to rechange to keep them moving. now the delta variants from africa  our life have to carry on living with the disease to  fight for it could it be something do with the climate change the world will the weatherman know to  focus the reason why for safely reason time to change to better mask n95 went outing.
"if more singapore residents recover from covid, does it not mean the more singapore residents have natural immunity? is natural immunity good?"
immunity is good. though the worry is whether the new variant breaks the immunity
"this is what happens when you rush to open up, discriminate the unvaccinated, risking more lives. back to square one. we should cancel the vtl, once it infiltrates, its hard to eradicate."
ah shit here we go again….
"variants? spikes? oh no, well when china had and has those but it didn't stop pap from letting them in freely."
still open to uk wow
"ease restriction within the country, close down flights from new variant countries, its that easy"
hk closed like hell still the virus sneaked in
this vaccination has no data or what so ever.
let’s roll the red carpet to welcome the south african variants into the lion city since we are so hospitable and liberal to extend vtl to more countries.
yeah that’s right. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
don't forget the band and pomp pomp girls too😉.
let's welcome them. hk don't welcome also virus arrive
or let’s just shut down the economy and lose our jobs. maybe that works better for you?
"bryan wang yeap, you can shut down your life and then you can go work in hell. good for all your buddies are there as everyone will agree with you."
angel s not sure if you got my point. anyway
bryan wang maybe you don’t understand what you are talking about and what you will be getting!
"angel s  nobody knows what he would be getting. this is the sad world today. if getting vaccinated can help the country, do our part and try best to overcome the virus. i guess we don't have much choices and livelihoods are important  nobody is going to feed us. they don't owe us anything"
"rs lin do you think that opening the economy will really benefit the common people? don’t you know that even before the pandemic, how many singaporeans in this country have been infected with the present system? guess who are the people who really still having their time of their lives even during the pandemic? what is really happening right now is called karma!"
"angel s  of course it benefits the common people. more employments. f&b, retailers, daily wage workers, self employed all will benefit.  you haven't seen poverty yet? look at philippines, malaysia, myanmar, srilanka, etc in philippines, there are people who live on trash. you are too comfortable to know and probably feel too entitled"
"rs lin ignorance to the core! don’t worried, you will soon learn what is singapore really is! it is called karma!"
"angel s  we have many karma students here. no, in fact karma preachers. those who can't win a debate will resort to karma. threatening others as if they are gods.  shameful behaviour and primitive"
angel s  an angel flirting with sins. correct name you gave yourself
rs lin you poor soul! you will learn soon. not everyone can make things come true! let’s find out soon!
angel s  how soon is soon? still flirting with sins angel?
"rs lin shame shall be upon those who lives  in ignorance! soon! very soon! it is so unfortunate that one never knows what he gets into with such arrogance! even with the virus, one still never learns! sad. be patient. sooner than you think."
angel s holding your tongue and saying molasses on the table isn't as hard🤣🤣
rs lin papies out in full force! can see why one needs to be on the ground for so long!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
rs lin told you to wait already. so impatient for karma to deliver! maybe tonight?
"angel s very superstitious, nothin' more to say, very superstitious, the devil's on his way,🤣🤣🤣"
"angel s when you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no😍😍"
bryan wang the answer is a big no!
"""couple from china sentenced to jail for obstructing covid-19 contact tracing in singapore"" hopefuly not repeat these cases again. since the covid first import in from wuhan."
how many more life you incompetent pap government gonna sacrifice!!!!
and what happened to living with covid? i thought that if we all got vaccinated there would be not more problems with people bring in new variants. wait. maybe we need the 4th shot? can the ministers please immediately make the 2nd and 3rd shot invalid and go straight to the fourth? we need all patriots/glassloots/pa/frontliners to take the 4th now before the new variant arrives.
"you can have antibodies level up to 500,000 and if the spike protein doesn't match the antibodies it just ain't gonna protect you"
"sigh. anyone can comment, but not everyone should be allowed to comment."
bryan wang  i agree with you fully👍

😂🤣😂🤣😂
booster jabbing strategy????
today's lesson:  living with covid is understanding it will mutate. we can't halt the economy and our lives everytime there is a mutation of the covid flu virus. can we please open up and follow thru with the plan of living with covid?
have you been infected before? lost a loved one to covid?
"shadostorm and what is your point? every day we assess risk when we cross a street so we avoid being hit by a car. daily life is a risk assessment...cars, trains, airplanes...we don't need a totalitarian government to control us."
vtl to and from south africa please!
why not? it will come here eventually like delta. let it come sooner to get some immunity.
should quickly bar travellers from hong kong too
no problem lah you can't ban every country  the world is linked and inter connected
congrats to kean yew for defeating the current world no.1. good luck going all the way in the final 3 rounds.

ttkoh123 mutants. what are we? playing in the x-men? teenage mutant ninja turtle. woa. so scary.
woofwoofchs watch?v=xdtcjakwtye
"richard wong the simple fact is ""delta"" itself is a variant of the c19 virus."
"woofwoofchs  no worry, the link is for educated singaporeans who will certainly know how to watch it. if you for a moment think that i would waste my time to educate you, you must be out of your crazy mind !."

"why do these people keep lying about covid variants. its already known that delta variant or any variant will only ever be neutral or weaker, almost never more effective by any standard."

talk cock... kid go away ! us now has more deaths from covid than their civil war.
protests across the world for freedom? solution: invent another variant
next they say variant will give people mental illness so everyone have to quarantine at imh.
"absolutely. that's how simple it is to play the variants game. over and over again and still millions believe it. lockdown, facemasks, never ending  vaccine etc etc.  but when i watch countries like méxico, tanzania and many african countries people already get on to their normal life."
"that's already the solution, it didn't work, so they invent a stronger variant."
"as long as we all stand firm against all form of coercion, threat, propaganda etc let them invent and re-invent thousand or a million kinds of variants, that is not going to help them win the battle at all. in fact, as more and more corporate or organizations realize, sudden deaths and long-term debilitating side effects among their employees is no more coincidence. those who stands firm eventually win the battle."
ucmcgl1lxt31trher_dicj6g the worst ever thing one can imagine in singapore is they're actually young parents who followed only government propaganda and voluntarily send their 5 years old kids for the trial jab at the kk hospital. and they actually feel proud for themselves... gosh.  i'm utterly speechless.
kai yin 😂
趙子龍  really ? mexico and tanzania are okay ?
"""invent"" another variant ? talking like a kid ! it clearly shows you know nothing about this virus ! go away and stop displaying your complete ignorance here !"
joe kerr  too much false intelligence are harmful to you
fiost  talk cock...kid. i doubt you know much about the new variant.  do you think who double promoted this variant from  vum to voc for fun ????
joe kerr  stay calm and see how it goes. no amount of g bashings will help you. it's habitual
joe kerrwell given i have had it i probably know more about it than you joe. go hide under the bed and let the rest of us get on with living life....
peter taylor no kid...you do not. people like you with your half-baked conspiracy theory can go and take a hike !
"joe kerr must be miserable under that bed. i feel sorry for you. actually, i don't..."

"if the fear of the new coronavirus variant comes true, many nations may have to reintroduce the economically painful lockdown restrictions."
singapore authority must immediately acts to stops all visitors that had been to seven  countries ofsouth africa. also must ban singapore citzens to south africa will bring back new deadly south africa corona virus variant that causes major disaster to singapore community. singapore authority must implement more control measures to prevent the deadly variant corona virus from south africa to enter singapore. singapore authority must always immediately ban all visit south africa during certain duration and some visitors might not tell the truth that had visited south africa or throw away old visiting recording and get a new document that didn't shown that the visitors had been to south africa. singapore authority must never never be complacency that testing will able to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa and must have ways to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa.
trying to fool the public again and again.
because they are most easily to be fooled.
"趙子龍 wumao are easier fooled than singaporeans, since their access to information is blocked :p"
sky what does that have to do with this?
what careful safeguards?  we are still importing cases from who knows where?  how sure is the minister that the african variants won’t creep into our society like the delta probably causing thousands more cases and hundreds more deaths?
you already gave up peoples lives lol. what a fake concern
besides giving up singaporean life...our jobs our future and our pride too...
"they are concern with ensuring the sustainability of the sales of  miraculous covid drugs  !  for that to be successful, first and foremost they need to release more new media-sponsored deadly covid variants !  first, the pfizer mordena as well as all the sinovac sinpharm they all wane within 3 to 6 months. worst still they knew darn well they are fighting a war with those vehemently against the vaccine mandates.  secondly, with this vaccine war going on there would be casualties. they need to keep finding alternatives to distract the attention of doctors who had wake up and realize all their scams.  thirdly, before people start falling away from their booby trap by advocating, using, smuggling ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.. they would certainly come out with as many miraculous covid drugs  for the hospitals."

side by side???? safely reopening with new variants
"we let them in one by one, so can manage"
safely reopening singapore is a contradiction in terms. it's an either-or situation. new s.a. variant just one of many new variants to come. that's a given. the question is: how long do we have before we get a new variant that makes vaccination useless?  food for thought.
this new ones is the one which make vaccination useless
vaccination is already useless
yes. i agree with you strongly at this point.
there's nothing to fear. the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant. more mutations better.
your boosters are already obsolete
even at europe countries increased covid19 especially england!
are these new variants introduced by the smart virus itself or some....????
seriously the virus is not smart. a virus is not a living thing outside our bodies.  the variants are created  through faulty replications.
"be prepare for your 4th booster ,new variant is coming in soon ,the old variant welcomes it gladly!!"
fark their booster bs...
yes 👏🏽 indeed. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
hopefully the pharmas will be able to quickly manufacture a proper vaccine for this variant
how many years are we going to do this?
"for a life time, most likely."
jerry money  any idea how to overcome this? are you a goat?
2099 years to see god
it is not how many years we are going to do this. it is not we who are doing this. it is something thrust upon humankind and what “we” are doing are to try our best to rise up to the challenge despite the flaws and weaknesses that we have. that is what “we” should and are going to do.
bryan wang  well said👍
bryan wang who care ?
aiyaaaa wakanda
is that alex karp in the thumbnail?? shall buy pltr tonight…
must be from lions
"is the new variant from s. africa, like mu which is reported to bypass the spike protein defences which most of our vax are jabbed with.."
it has over 50 mutations and feared to bypass vaccine defenses .
new variants. singapore's covid direction will be expected to tax our already exhausted health care people.  hope the govt are prepared.
"don't worry. the govt got enough money from pfizer. in business, nothing is free. if something is free, you are the product."
take care
"new s.a. variant has 30 mutations and fears of vaccine evasions. cases detected in s.a. , botswana and in a passenger in hk who arrived from s.a."
there's nothing to fear. the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant. more mutations better.
"read carefully what those msm like reuters say : ""according to local media reports, at least one case of the new strain – the b.1.1.529 variant, which the who named ‘omicron’ on friday – has been detected in the country. the virus was reportedly found in a young woman who recently traveled to egypt via turkey. the patient reportedly had neither been vaccinated nor contracted covid-19 in the past. if confirmed, the belgian case is set to become the first one detected in europe."" obviously, the blame is on the unvaccinated again ! its all because of this unvaccinated young woman blah..blah..blah. and within seconds, millions of such messages would be spread across the world by the msm."
woofwoofchs the who scientists have stated this is the deadliest variant discovered so far.
jo marko please present your source if you say so.
"woofwoofchs out of 32 mutations in its spike protein, 10 are in the binding domain .. those that attach to the ace2 receptor of the cell - an indication of high transmission and infection characteristic. the delta had only 2 binders in its spike.  there are lots of material on the net to read up."
jo marko no shit sherlock. of course theres lots of material on the net to read up. its the net for god sake. source.
"jo marko  who knows it's deadly  ? another concoction of mr fauci "" gain-of-function "" experiment  ?"
"in s korea, 800 people had to wait for 24 hours for a bed in hospital. in singapore, we let them die at home. the mmtf bluff us they want to be with loved ones before they die. they think we born yesterday? with the covid being so infectious and dangerous, shouldn't moh insist that they go to hospital? no admission. no record. nobody knows.  that's why our icu beds are not filled to capacity. people die at home. that's what living with covid means in singapore."
african lion got the new variant
hong kong also kena

"please go ahead with the kid's immunisation as fast as it is possible. the dosage of the biontech is 1/3 of the adult dosage. if it is true there is no other change - which should not, otherwise it needed again all 3 phases of clinical testing - please evaluate, if diluting here in singapore is possible."
see how this goes? every year a new scary variant around the corner. no one seems to care that singapore's all cause excess death rate does not show any signs of a health care crisis whatsoever. they can keep this narrative going forever. this virus is gonna mutate forever.
"minister iswaran, hopeyouhave the tools ready, having spore learnt hard lessons, last 2yrs..mtf on hand.."
"to the most, he flood our healthcare systems and mr ong will also need to answer for it. stay tune."
hong kong is very closed.  now have this variant.  why?
"tim loo1  haha, they have  lost their sense of reasoning..they must be disappointed that worker's party is also in favour of full vaccination and boosters. must be a big blow to them🤣🤣🤣"
tim loo1  by the way i asked this many times. none dares to reply me. what happen to the raeesah khan's case after worker's party form the committee to investigate? silence is golden🤣🤣🤣
tim loo1  i agree with you. no wp's supporters will come near your posts🤣🤣 tongue tied liao
raise concern?   shouldnt the concern be raised before opening up?   blindly opening up then raise concern?   sound like rob the bank without thinking of the consequences!!!!
same like you commenting without using your brain?

"living with the virus is wrong. it is a breeding ground for mutants. who said """"the more covid 19 circulates, the more opportunity this virus has to change to mutate and develop different forms, it is essential that we all continue to work to reduce the circulation of covid 19."""""
ttkoh123 that's cool! i've been looking forward to teenage mutant ninja turtles since forever!
"ttkoh123 everybody knows 1.)  virus mutation has not stopped 2.) existing vaccines are not effective in preventing infection , critical condition and death 3.) effective medication is not available.  only rumored medication ivermectin  (denial by authority).  given such conditions,  they choose to open up and live with virus.  now they raised concern!!!  thats strange and puzzling!!!!"
"des chan rather than to complain, which everyone with half a brain can do, any positive suggestions to provide that doesn’t result in tanking our economy and the livelihood of the common singaporean?"
bryan wang complain?  to yr pea brain everything is complain !!!
"​des chan lol everyone that has a brain knows existing vaccines has proven to be effective. data have been provided to you many times and you called it fake.  yet, you believe in the unproven and untested horse drug - ivermectin.  to me, this is more strange and puzzling."
"des chan spoon feed you with data again =) but too bad your pea brain can't process it. well, hope other people that viewed this can.  over the past 7 days, the number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated cases who are critically ill in the icu are at 0.5 and 4.5 per 100,000 population respectively. over the same period, the number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated cases who died are 0.02 and 0.5 per 100,000 population respectively. among seniors aged 60 and above, the number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated cases who are critically ill in the icu are 1.6 and 41.8 respectively.  the number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated seniors who died are 0.1 and 5.5 respectively."
des chan lol that the best you got? pathetic
albert pang thanks
tim loo1 hahahahaha!
tim loo1 nah...you think des chan is capable of giving an intellectual answer even if i asked? 🤣
money is the god. it will grant protection. hopefully we can pay the price down the road.
keonz you just answered your own question. so brilliant. i will only clap👏 when death rate goes down to zero.
keonz no need to insult people when they have genuine concerns. the size of your brain is a grain of sand.
"bochapliao thanks,  they r just released to bark brainlessly.   not worth our time"
"bochapliao lol you must be one if his antivax friends. at least i have a brain, you guys don't don't have 1"
there's no such thing as safely opening singapore... either you do it while considering our health and safety or without. period.
hk closed very tightly.  it still came
"fiost simple. you knock, they open."
new restrictions have been placed on travellers from several african countries by the ministry of health (moh) amid reports of a potentially more contagious variant of the covid-19 virus circulating in that region.
be prepared for the inevitable. south africa variant will come like how delta did.
dun worry lah....since our mts...are so elite and smart ...they always r the best leaders in this world ...but i disappointed lol
we 100% trust pap <b>+100 social credit score</b>
"what's this, 4th time already"
yeah that’s true indeed and strongly agree to that too.
there's nothing to fear. delta variant is nonsense. the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant. more variants the better.
delta came direct from india. omicron will come indirectly. already it is in hong kong.
edric yeo  there will be many times. nobody knows the virus
albert pang  what did wp say?
sarcasm from the replies does help to provide an avenue to vent the frustrations we are feeling now. hopefully you guys feel better after venting
"whether we like it or not, it will come here eventually. again mtf is to be blamed i suppose. we can't reason no more"
fiost you have already reasoned yourself. what else to say?🙂
wuhan virus
"rs lin that say nothing becos none is virus experts,,,, better than those self procliam virus handling expert"
tim loo1  he can't even afford a ticket let alone the accommodation and food.🤣🤣🤣
"huang er li  we have to change all the who experts too, is that what you mean?"
dhiren dev  you must be a fan of palki sharma upadhyay.
"tim loo1  they are not democrats. any one who stone, burns and beat people whose opinion differs from them are not democrats."
thulomanchay no i’m a fan of the wuhan clan
tim loo1 yes especially for people who have no voice to speak up. make noise so they can be heard too. not just your gong.
"rs lin true, no money to buy ticket, hotel and food but got friends to sponsor  him out. any problem?"
bryan wang yes🙂
huang er li which group you belong to???
"dhiren dev  there is no such thing as the wuhan clan, you must be a wumao, in other words a traitor."
the best thing to do now is for all the patriots /pa/glass loots to take their boosters as soon as possible. and get their kids into the trials. then boost them as well.

teniers lai why should i? all patriots are not losers and must stay to volt for changes and for the benefits for all singaporeans. singapore belongs to everyone.
"teniers lai well, this is a democratic country and it is all based on numbers and choices. we can't allow the falsehoods of ""growing the economy for the rich"" while the majorities have to suffer. we can't accept the falsehoods to enrich only the elitist, the powerful and the rich. again, this is a democratic country and it is all based on numbers and choices. when people trade your means of livelihoods and risk your family life-safeties, will you rest your children future with them? 2025 what's up?"
"ttkoh123 beside talk and talk and talk, what is your suggestions?"
"teniers lai as i have said multiples of times before; vaccination should never have been used as an excuse to risk singaporeans’ lives. it does not confer immunity and still exposes singaporeans to the virus. stop the imports from higher-risk countries and the leaks into the communities. safe guard the life-safety of all singaporeans, particularly the younger ones, elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority."
"teniers lai lawrence wong said [26 jul 2021 in parliament] - “as we do so, we must expect cases to rise, partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level. also, as we open our border for people to travel without shn, we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time, but at that stage as you heard just now, [our main focus will no longer be on daily cases] numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus, they are much less likely to become very ill.”  [ note: capitalized words ]  lawrence wong said [4 may 2021] in defending the imports – “we knew that there would be leaks from time to time. we know that these risk could happen”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “risk” because as early as april 2021, singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid-19 variant was already spreading in singapore?  and during that time, not many singaporeans were even vaccinated.  to make the matter even worse. mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew.  why must they keep importing from higher risk countries?"
"teniers lai  in short, sacrificing the life-safeties of the citizens to benefit and protect the wealthy and their cronies companies with cheap imports from higher risks countries which backfired to the current situations with mounting deaths everyday? 61% in deep shock. what's up 2025."
"be quiet. if you're afraid, stay home and live in fear for the rest of your existence. the rest of us that want to live our lives will do so without your fear mongering. get the shot, take intelligent precautions, live your life and shut up...please."
s m... may the undertaker receives your parents soon so that you can wake up your ideas to work together to build a safer environment for everyone especially the elderly singaporeans.

s m... dun be a clown or join the circus. they are recruiting.
richard wong you have already accepted the invitation as you live in continual fear and believe the government should make decisions for you.
"ttkoh123 if you truly care about the health of singapore then you should be a vocal proponent to end all cigarettes sales and fatty foods. are you aware of the annual deaths from heart disease? once again, we all need to assess our own risks...some people smoke, drink, cross busy streets etc, so let us all assess the risk of going out and living with covid... government need not be involved. to advocate a strict policy of restricting our personal freedom because you are personally afraid is wrong my friend. don't impose your totalitarian ideas because you are afraid of a flu virus."

ttkoh123 haha you copy and paste your previous comment. you invalid yourself as a free thinking rational person and incapable of addressing my comment. you make singapore a worse place with your emotional comments devoid of substance. please lock yourself inside and keep yourself safe. you do not belong in public.
"s m... incidentally;  singapore ramping up vaccine manufacturing capacity – [cna 5jun2020 before election]."
"besides banning the 7 aficians countries,  countries that open to the 7 countries should be banned too."
"yes please. banning based on historical travels is very ineffective. a person that has never traveled to the 7 african countries, but infected by a peer that has traveled to the african countries is a loophole and opens a big vulnerability to singapore. fix this lousy travel restriction that has been put in place dear mts!"
exactly right. a traveller returning from egypt brought the virus back to belgium. mtf however is more concerned abt opening up to as many countries as possible and restoring its global travel hub status. have vaccination will travel. money matters more than lives.
"haha, lockdown lah. hong kong very closed.  what happened?"
y  how do you know?
y prob he didnt hv access to privy sources like you...
"omicron will arrv sooner than expected. "" six deaths due to the disease. nine imported cases."" source- yahoo 27 nov'21"
"the notice still say ""digital meet-the-people session (from 26 sep 2021 till further notice)"", siam of what? expecting all the elderly and people with problems to be tech savvy? what the h. i think all the ministers should resume the mtps and personally face to face serve their ""fully vaccinatted"" residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face-to-face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october."
"so, let's give you a figure of measure so that you can understand the situation better; from 23 oct to 25 nov alone [ref moh updates] children 0-11 years old = 7,829 infected children 12-19 years old = 3,509 infected total infected children is 11,338 numbers"
"the safest is safety by avoidance, for example no face to face mtp session while gates are opened for enterprise businesses?"
yeah that’s true indeed i agree with you strongly at this point too. ministers from the pap union are all doomed. incompetent imbecile and arrogant and refuses to used their brains 🧠 too.
"no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine. it's simply illogical in the context of citizens life-safeties. single party is unwise and dangerous."
"these days, trust will not be granted easily for the basis were eroded.  voters deserve to be respected with the truths and not cherry picked data to benefit their narratives."
"who said """"the more covid 19 circulates, the more opportunity this virus has to change to mutate and develop different forms, it is essential that we all continue to work to reduce the circulation of covid 19."""""
"why the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening? why are we relying on inaccurate ""r"" numbers?"
"prof teo on the 19 nov 2021 said, ""but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate, i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources, because at this stage, the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening, given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore, many people who are infected will not be tested with pcr test to confirm, and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers. and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection, it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community. and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly, we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require icu care."
"therefore, moh data are inaccurate or misleading?"
"basing on the revelation, i think either the miw is too complacent at the expense of citizens’ life-safeties, or they are only focusing on business and enrichment for a handful of people."
"as i have speculated few days ago; ""i ""speculate"" that numbers will continue to fall from the recent updates and that the actual counting are intentionally lagged or only the majority of unvaccinated are counted, so as to re-blame in onto the coming festive seasons for the lacks of compliances with sudden big jump in numbers, the purpose of which is to dilute and cloak the blames of the original reckless imports from high risk counties which backfired to the epidemic situation with mounting deaths everyday so as to exonerate themselves.?"""
please add philippines for vtl
"for opening of gurantine free land vtl, i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than 50% of its capacity. all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings. for every private vehicles, it should only be allowed to carry not more than 3 paxs (including driver will be 4 persons). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated. that way, safe distancing can be maintained. should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in jb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches."
i think we should just mind our own business 1st before putting our nose on other nation's affair on how they want to proceed with the vaccinated travel lane...
"yes, agreed,,,worried about those corrupted, country certificate of vaccinations,,,,travellers coming to my dear singapore. pls pls get our hse in order,,mtf."

"i was ignorant doing so...so i decided to try mr robert and ever since then he's has made about $33,000 for on every $4,000 i invested just in 1weeks."
robert martinez has really made name for himself
"i'm not here to converse for him but to testify just for what i'm sure of,"
sylvia clara he's trust worthy and best option ever seen.
sylvia clara he has made success easier than we thought.
sometimes i wonder if he's uses magical powers to trade.
i've never heard or seen any of he's clients complain of lost....i think he's just too perfect.
i doubted it too before i gave it a try...and it was of no regret
he's not like other brokers that will start telling you stories and excuses why they trade didn't go well after collecting your money.
"jackson mayer a friend that i referred to him just received €61,050 profit after 7days of investing.... i became jealous.. lol"
my first experience with him gave me the assurance that has made me to invest without fear of loosing.
"allen jessica natural, there’s a lot of math involved in forex trading,"
"allen jessica but this is often presented in forms of daunting technical charts, indicators, patterns."
when i saw testimonies all over the place i thought it was all made up stories till i was convinced and gave it a try.
and honestly i don't regret the move i made because i invested in a big way.
"i'm from switzerland, i and two other of my friends tried him immediately we testified ,"
he's strategies is awesome. he's trading last week was boooom!!!
mary smith do you know that most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advised them against investing and trading forex
mary smith while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially.
ellen white i thought i'm the only one he has helped walk through the fears and falls of forex trading.
"12th winning thanks to mr robert martinez , he's really the best, i've made a lot."
"marilyn linda really you know him too?,"
"i just withdrew my $33,000 of my $3000 i invested 7days ago"
"i met mr robert last year for the first time at a conference in london,"
"vee london i invested €9,000 and he traded it in 1week making close to €170,000"

these joker are destroying the country. yet they are saying the situation is under control
🤬🤥🤷‍♂️omg! how come the coe can still keep rising in singapore n in tis pandemic ⁉️ now most ppl staying home n work from home n less travelling n there is less need of cars . 🆘 market manipulation ? government trying to turn a blind eye on it ❓or are they oso in it ⁉️to collect more money 💰 n as reserve are low ❓can squeeze n squeeze is it ⁉️
get ready for 10k cases daily if the gov continues to open its legs wide apart to foreigners
come on we we still have over 1000 cases. dont bring in more.
"hello 50 cent army, how are the comments going today"
stupid government
i am conflicted because i see both sides thinking.
"can't even handle the recent spike, want to open to more countries."
"​seal young he models his policies based off america. i wish we had the old wp's leadership back instead of the new upstarts parroting america's horrible woke liberal agendas.  you realise singapore is a very small country. removing the mask mandate would be a disaster. the endemic was forced upon us without asking whether we want it. i'm pro vacc but it's painfully obvious the vaccine isn't doing the 94-95% as advertised from the start. if you want a true endemic, you'll need an effective treatment, simple as that. mask fatigue? i have chronic asthma, i still wear my mask properly and i don't have wfh luxuries. don't see what's the issue."
"ha, mr ong luck just like jacky chan😁. moh have to work harder."
"pfizer vaccine is posion, 2nd dose will make you sick, please don't trust the government"
"the travel, tourism and hospitality industries are doomed. and, do not expect a v-shape curve recovery anytime soon. this is a result of the great reset agenda."
seal young the ground expect an economic collapse followed by civil unrest.
don't worry. getting better day by day. 😁
eric phua we've enter the tribulation and will be getting from bad to worst.
dayy logg . already worst. can only look forward to get better. wish jobless local can get a job quickly before the ceca flood open again. hope gov give a window period of at least 6 months before opening up the ceca flood gate. we needs to create more jobs before bring more workers from india.
eric phua more big crisis coming our way for the next 7 years.
"dayy logg . jobs in aerospace is now make available due to the vtl. hopefully, it will benefit the local who are jobless due to covid.💪"
"eric phua i already said before, more crisis coming out way. you should not be deluded and deceived."
dangling a carrot on a string in front our eyes
"bunch of fearmongerers are having their usual fear-fest in the comments. i hope the government doesn't mistake their opinions for what singaporeans really think. with 82% vaccinated and hospitals in no danger of exceeding capacity, singapore will never be in a better position to deal with endemic covid. lets face it, almost everyone will have covid eventually, and there will always be a threat of new variants. there's no real choice: life must go on."
you cant just open when we are yet to stabilized in our number of case! does money place a more important than human lives?
not a matter of money. we can't escape from the virus live with it and join in the national effort
"i agreed that we have to live with the virus, but to the fact that they are ramping up so fast in opening is something that i don't understand."
hyun man  because the world is not still. staying closed and being late have long term implications to our nation's business which means the future generations may suffer
jerry money  which country doesn't look for money? see some of the poorest countries where food is scarce?big head big tummy...malnutrition.  why would we want to cut off our own survival?
how are you doing today. hyun man?
"pretty sure the plan is for everyone to get the virus at some point. booster shot for the old so death rates won’t be so high even if that means they go into icu. once everyone pretty much got it, they can call it herd protection and just proceed to booster shot everyone and ensure everyone’s got the antibodies so they don’t end up in the icu. if everyone is infected but don’t have much symptom and more like just the flu, everyone goes to normalcy💁🏻‍♀️ tho tbh, to bet that the virus won’t mutate to something more deadly….that’s quite a risk to take. which seems like something the govt is willing to take."
singapore so lucky to have pap govt. my country malaysia is hopeless. give me pap govt anytime!
ask ttkoh123 to exchange our government with your.
please take them away from us la...whyyouwanna exchange trash for trash. both should be in the dumpster
so you apply singapore citizenship? 🤗 nato not counted.

"japan, taiwan and rest of europrean countries are next. we have swiss banks here, swiss are welcome too."
we demand singaporeans to able to go out as well! they only want economy to come in and not go out. so they rather continue to cage singaporeans within singapore irregardless of our sanity! it is almost like putting virus into a chamber trapping us as we are not able to leave. other third world countries performing better than singapore already. what a shame!
you are free to go out .go ahead and dine 5 pax everyday ( all vaccinated). govt only asked you for cooperation to scale down activities but you have the right to go out within the rules. don't complain too much

"the covid infections among kids in the usa are increasing rapidly with 240,000 cases per week on average."
aiya. please stop la
hope from india also open for vaccinated valid mom  pass holder
in 2929....u wait ah...keemok nyo kling!
"india not trustworthy. if they can fake education cert, why not fake vaccination cert?"
"summer galwhen can open to china then why not india, atleast india not created virus."
summer gal it is possible to verify the authenticity of the vaccination certificates.
"akshay maldhure sure can verify. by the time it is detected or verified, virus also came in too"
"summer gal in case someone detects positive even after presenting an authentic vaccination certificate, there's a provision to quarantine such a traveler. no?"
"summer gal also, i saw multiple comments from you suspecting the air india and air india express flights arriving from india into singapore daily being the cause of increasing cases in singapore. if you still think so, please read about ""vande bharat mission"", which is an effort by the indian government to bring home its citizens stranded abroad in countries including singapore. please also understand that singapore has imposed a complete ban on passengers having a travel history of india in last 21 days, so no direct travel from india to singapore is possible at the moment. so there's no way these air india and air india express planes could carry even one passenger on incoming flights to singapore. hope you understand."
"akshay maldhure if you’re a multi-billionaire putting your investment here in singapore, we welcome. if you’re thinking of job opportunities here, don’t as we are still in recovery mode. also we don’t have enough hospital bed to house covid cases from foreigners esp india being no2 in covid worldometer. stay in your own country or go elsewhere. pls also don’t bring your father or mother over too. bring down your country covid cases first and don’t pass the burden to other country. thank you and hope you understand too! interesting, so these air india and air india express don’t carry india citizens from india to singapore. so empty planes and waste fuel, huh? if carried folks from other country, will be interesting  to know who took these planes."
"summer gal yes, the planes are empty from india to singapore just to get the stranded citizens back to india like i said earlier (unless there are any singaporeans wanting to travel from india back to their homeland). there's no way to get any indians on these planes to singapore due to the ongoing travel ban and air india is charging double the usual airfare to avoid any potential losses (you would have understood this if only you could do your research completely). and with all due respect, you're no one to specify who should come to singapore and with whom. the singapore government and officials will decide that. talking about the numbers, india is a country of 1.37 billion people and yet it has administered around 0.84 billion doses already, so you don't have to blame only india for the number of cases. afterall, india isn't the one who created the virus (oh, please don't even get me started on this). also, from your multi-billionaire remark, you yourself are trying to imply that money anyway stands higher than lives for people like you. i can sense a lot of insecurity from the way you're talking not just with me but with others too. but i don't blame you for this, this pandemic has changed the way people think about each other now. peace."
akshay maldhure say what you wish but sentiment on the ground from many locals towards your country men remain unchanged. our government has to open up economy because we need investment to come in and we gladly welcome them. however it is a different ball game for people coming for job opportunities and especially from high risk country like india.
"summer gal very much understandable. if i were in your place, i might have had similar thoughts about this situation. so i sincerely hope that the people from both the sides work in making the sentiment positive for each other. and i pray for the well-being of singapore and its people. 🙏🏼 talking about india, the population is so humongous that keeping things in control is extremely difficult. so i hope mass vaccinations help in some way. thankfully, countries like singapore have imposed a complete ban to avoid any cases from india getting in. not being defensive, but india saw a massive outbreak during april to june this year, but currently the number of cases is quite low."
akshay maldhure thank you and i hope all of us emerge safely out from this global viral infection.
"currently singapore unemployment & under-employment for singapore local still high, so we don't needs more workers from india to displace local now. we now open to countries which are investing in singapore first to create more jobs. 🚫please wait 6 months for singapore covid situation to improve, and hopefully everything return back to normal."
"eric phua i understand what you're saying, but why specifically target india for the jobs? i'm sure there would be many work pass holders from other regions as well?"
"akshay maldhure . other south east asian countries are same as india. currently, only us, uk, canada, korea and eu. next will be japan and rest of eu. 95% of our mncs from these countries. so we needs to start with these countries first. we hope these mncs will shift out some of their operations and jobs from china & hk ( since they have power outrage) to india and singapore. then that time we can bring in more workers from india  into singapore.😁 also, our mr ong also needs some time to increase hospital icu beds and bring down our covid 19 cases.🤦 somehow his luck like jacky chan."
eric phua understandable. thanks for explaining your perspective. i appreciate and respect your views.
akshay maldhure . modi doing an excellent deal with taiwan semi-conductor investments in india. hopefully the deals would be successfully implemented as soon as possible.👍
those working in airport need to take all type of vaccines for protection. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jhwxten6yahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jhwxten6ya
"fauci insists 3 shots will be needed for ‘full vaccination’, after fda advisory panel rejects universal covid boosters does anyone here trust faucie ??"
"thank you, mps, for risking our life and bringing in more possible virus variants to this country."
dunwan risk life then stay at home la. stay at home your whole life. then wont get any virus. maybe depression only.
"just stay in your home, you will feel safe"
silly replies...  residents are tied to home while tourists are free to roam freely??  whose country n home does this belongs to??
"seal young any mps can say what they like.  ultimately the residents are the one who suffer, especially those who have young children and elderly with underlying illnesses. and whenever there is a cluster, the businesses are closed for cleansing and the livelihoods of these workerd are affected.  when they cannot even handle the recent rising cases properly, they still want to create more virus variants.  here you show pitiful to the healthcare workers, there you continue to subject them to more inpatients.  😆👏👏👏"
"here they show concern about global warming and water conservation, there they continue to kill more forest to build condominiums with swimming pool, then build more underground tunnels that require more electrical powers for aircon and train to run and then generate more warmth to the envrironment.  dont you think they nato about all these concerns that they brought up in the past??  here they mention about drop in fertility n marriage, then how come got demands for more houses?  of cause to cater to the foreign investors but at the expense of damaging our precious land and forest."
seal young haha...
tourist don't roam freely in the country then they come singapore for what. stay in hotel is it. you go another country you don't go out? everyone else advised to minimal contact to protect yourself wad. can still get covid from fellow unlucky singaporeans. or is it you ok with getting from singaporean but not from tourist.  you think singapore is the only one that open travel? close country then complain no money no investor forced to take leave. open country then complain risking your life.  you the kind that just want to complain the government always going against you is it
lol use your brain it’s an endemic
"daniel s it is a pandemic, not endemic.  we are not the only country with this particular virus."
layla your reply shows you lack of life experiences to see through the issues
"justice honest agree - but we need to learn to live with it. life goes on. esp with 80% vaccination rate. no point shutting off like a hermit crab. our economy is dependent on free trade flow, people, services etc."
"foreigner can come in easily, but locals can't even go on holidays without shn after returning..."
sure can travel to countries which singapore have vtl with.
"are we ready for mass infection scenario?  the gov needs to have a preparation plan for the people if they want to open up? what next if we tested positive?  where is the medicine that we can take to help ourself !!!  if we get infected, hospital full, quarantine at home to infect our love one? kids below 12 ? parent &gt; 60?...how many such family in the likely case scenario? the gov appears unprepared for mass infection but they are steering us toward the storm."
"nus prof, one of the experts worked on function gain with wuhan. sure gov have confidence in opening up. maybe they know virus is just vaccination scam."
lai liao lai liao. must wear bio suits liao.
crypto insider err
"seal young i just saw st report. news sate lim said review the rules for mask fatigue. some ppl really have these and cannot be denied. for me it ok because i always at hm. but those who need to work, needs rest from masks. government should look into auto decontamination areas, where individual can take down their mask to rest for 10-15mins. auto decontamination, before the next person can use the facility. as long as there is more then 1 person, mask should always be on. that's the only way as vaccine does not work!"
why still indian's not allowed???
"huh, wahyouso entitled ah....keemok nyo kling! wait till 2929!"
"sorry guys ,,, bcoz, you can get fake certs of any kind. the world knows this,,wake up my friend. jai hind"
"walk away i didn't ask your permission mr, just walk away"
"🤑 for countries with investment in singapore first. next we will have japan and rest of european countries. currently unemployment and under-employment in singapore for still high. 🚫we can't accept more workers from india to displace more local citizens at the moment or pap may loss next election.we needs to create more jobs first. our pm say covid situation will improve in 6 months time. hopefully, everything back to normal by then. please wait."

"seal young 👍 whether you like it or not, the virus has made a home here on planet earth. by closing our borders, we can have zero covid eventually. question is closed for how long is sufficient. the minute we open up, virus from other countries will come in. so can we afford to close forever and ever with no ending? ask yourself if this is a workable solution. can we revert back to pre-covid time?"
seal young agreed totally!
so vaccine and 4 swabs up my nose to visit expensive forced masked singapore. no thanks. i'll stay in europe where we have common sense to live with the virus.. good luck with your 900 tourists i'm sure that will help revive your business and tourism sector. i'll only visit singapore when you require one test upon arrival and no forced vaccinations on me. also why is natural immunity not taken into consideration? it's already proven people with natural immunity have 13 times better protection than the vaccine

"rs lin true. but the statement ""it's only deadly for old people"" remains false. we have to move on, but not being guided by misinformation. statements like that will only promote complacency amongst the young."

"incredibly amazing singapore govt.   what give them the confident to open up freely? 1.)  vaccines is not effective against variant d 2.)   virus mutation has not stopped .  just variant d alone, those guys are struggling to support 3.)    there is no foolproof measure to filter virus infected effectively. 4.)   medical system to support has limit 5.)   age below 12 and those with chronic sickness are vulnerable."
wang lei give them and us the confidence.. li pa zam bay? https://youtu.be/oprv6wrpthihttps://youtu.be/oprv6wrpthi so what variant variant... delta mu... even barca psingapore variant also like that.. most importantly already proven it lessen a lot of serious symptoms and diseases. just shut up and get vaccinated la.. so much kpkb for what?? prolonged lockdown has worse effect on mental health and marriage. this is proven. even us going to open for all fully vaccinated international travellers.. look at football in europe.. stadium packed.. look at nba and even wwe.. arena packed and people cheering and yelling.. you antivaxxers still here kpkb kbkp kpkb.

allen chua vax works singapore wouldnt hv so many daily cases
"des chan  works la... if not working, you think government dare open this open that for vaccinated people only?? and opening up international travelling? don't forget still got about 1million people not vaccinated. if everyday 1000 unvaccinated people is infected.. wow.. also need 1000 days... (almost 3 years) to clear.. but give you discount since over 80% vaccinated now.. if 500 cases from unvaccinated.. wow.. need 5 years to clear. so don't kpkb everytime when there is good news for vaccinated people.. just get jab as see the maximum effect of herd immunity."

des chan wrong. no vaccine protects against infection. vaccines protect against the effects of infection. this is why rates of death and serious illness are so much lower amongst vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated.
dennis bloodnok so?
don't we need to get our house (local covid situation) in order first?  wouldn't this create more strain on our already strained healthcare?  how many travelers would dare to come to a country with high number of covid cases?

"for countries with investment in singapore first. we needs to create job for our jobless local first. 🚫 students and workers from india have to wait till singapore covid situation improve. our pm say needs 6 months. please wait. mr modi should provide for indian student education, not singapore."
eric phua then i think singapore should return the fee of indian students. still your colleges are taking money from indian students. why singapore is not stop them to collect fee. without foreigners your country is nothing.
saale bol to ese rhe jaise singapore inke baap ki jagir hai paise lete hi kyu ho indians se tab nhi pta tha  ab hamarhi country me corona nhi hai abb tum logo ko hi fti huyi hai
pardeep chahal . yes. please write to the school to ask forvthe fee back. why are you paying tge school fee if they can't secure you a ticket to fly in.
eric phua if school listen to us then i don't think i need to waste my time for ur comments
eric phua they know to take fee don't know how to return
eric phua now ther forcing the students to di online classes from their home country now a days every country started the flights to india only your country have problems not your country only you have problems with indians i think
pardeep chahal . why you pay when can't travel to the country? anyone told you to do so? the school told you to pay up even you can travel to singapore?
eric phua i paid in january they give me approval for april last  in april india face second wave of covid now everything is okay but now singapore facing growth in covid cases  who has fault now  by the way what you have problems
"when will the gov acknowledge that vaccines don't prevent transmission?  makes little sense to assume that vaccinated travelers will not carry the virus when moh own stats (which has since been quietly removed) showed that 80% of infected were vaccinated people in the rolling avg of the previous 28 days.  since, as of last month, more than 80% of population has been vaccinated, the stats don't support the 40% effectiveness in transmission reduction as claimed by oyk.  not that the strategy would make sense either even if 40% was true.  understand the need to resume travel, but this strategy of discrimination based on vaccination status is highly dubious.  wouldn't pcr or art testing be a much better determinant of infection in any mitigation strategy?  the stats are all there, from israel and other countries, and more pertinently, from moh itself on the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing transmissions or delta (not alpha) infections.  why are we deliberately acting as if we are dealing with the alpha variant where the initial trials showed a 90% efficacy rate of infection prevention, when delta is the predominant strain?  and why stop publishing the stats without an explanation? it all does not add up."
new world order!! global agenda
"now they let foreigners with public announcement. previously,  they just allow the foreigners free flow. even blind do realise that malaysian bike and cars getting more on our singapore road."
we welcome all foreigners.  make our country vibrant
wahhhhh.. nea fumes the chutes and a lot of dead cockroaches around.. nobody sweep leh... singaporeans complain leh... you want to bring tour family to help sweep first until you think the foreign workers can come in and work??

"everyday sia/changi/aviation industry is bleeding millions everyday. sia use to have 18-20million passengers a year pre-covid, now its operating at &lt; 3% capacity. so 900 passengers is a joke/token number. that's why singapore got no choice but to go full burn on endemic mode. i honestly think the mot minister don't know what to do, i didn't hear any solution to get the spread of covid in public transport under control. all i heard was the gospel that things are hard and here is what's happening. singaporean's don't want to hear whats going on, we want to hear what are you doing about it to arrest the spread of covid over public transport (mrt/buses and in stations/terminals). here again making speeches and putting an over reliance of vax program."
"he was temasek holdings overseas investment ceo,who was involved in buying shin corp for $2 billions,but it was later slapped with illegal purchase of a thailand company with restriction of a maximum of 49%.temasek holdings suffered a financial loss and had to return the illegal purchase back to the country.however,the whole team was terminated,except http://iswaran.it/iswaran.it must be amazing that he still remains a millionaire minister.....no accountability,transparency,integrity and honesty whatsoever .singaporeans have been told to socialise in companies,eating out restricted to two persons per table in open-air space or five persons in airconditioned environment.yet,the door is opened wide for visitors from some countries without any quarantine.imported cases are reported daily on arrival or after shn quarantine are not considered crucial in managing this http://crisis.living/crisis.living in the new norm of the pandemic comes with regular vaccinations and tests,even though spike of more cases in the thousands will be http://inevitable.safety/inevitable.safety and health of the people matter less than opening up of the country to boost the economy reigns supreme."
buy low sell high? but in free fall mode where is the low? buy low sell lower.
"shawn you bring up a good point, what will be the consequences of sia stock collapsing on our reserves. how much of sia is on temasek's portfolio? we have a high debt to gdp ratio, if our reserve's valuation falter by as much as 50%+ we could default on our national debt."
"cv hawkeye this is the result of short-sightedness, thinking we can put all eggs into tourism, spending million dollars to build so many airports, mbs, sentosa facilities, etc.  haha.. in the end bleeding in investment but ceos of sia and temasek holdings continue to get highly paid despite poor business returns??  how not to bleed internally when they do not look inward to stop the bleed but instead look outward for more funds.  furthermore, in this covid era, how much money can you bring in through tourism when our rate of infection is so high? we cannot expect earnings like before from tourism now but such decision will in fact cost our country even more when normal livelihoods are affected by more clusters and closures of restaurants, shops and markets just to halt the spread."
"justice honest big corp with big assets cannot turn on a dime, time scales are often many months 12+ ; years. everyone wants to enter the markets with high margins/roi, most of these eggs are just that, but of course they are also the most covid prone (which honestly it become from (jan 2020) zero to a world pandemic in 6mths). so base on sar-1, decision makers thought we can go on a holding pattern for 12-18mths. our hsk was over generous and spent $100b without much roi. any asset on hold still burns money. this year lw has been scraping the bottom of the barrel with much less support vs 2020. because i don't believe we can afford another draw down on our reserves. our national debt is biting us atm and the valuation of our reserves is also uncertain. that's why die die we are moving towards endemic mode. no choice, if any valuation of our government link corps collapse eg sia keppel etc. we could spiral very quickly to economic disaster. i doubt that will happen, but there is always a chance. its not inward or outward looking, you can't make money if you close your markets, so sad to say g has to force a reopening asap there is no more time for most businesses. individuals of course want safety first, but to a point we can't afford to go full safety. so pick your poison health risk or financial ruin, both is not good for our livelihoods."
"cv hawkeye hsk is just a puppet and had to listen to his boss to release the money and so now shoulder the blame.  sigh... all these years they have not been prudent with our reserves, cheated by foreign investors. distributing money like there is no tomorrow  and then collect more money from us or steal local insurance businesses by creating their own insurance policies and forcing everyone to buy their own medical insurance using our cpf.  what good business have they created so far??  even businesses set up by first generation of mps are now sinking by 3rd generation till now. cannot see any future of singapore now."

"welcome lambda n mu; both resistant to vaccines. booster jab ain't gonna save u, just put ur life at higher risk"
you a doctor or epidemiologist?....or just an armchair scaremongering local?
"oh nooooo..... how? let's dig a hole, put a coffin in and hide ourselves inside the coffin from the variants forever...  so that we can stay safe and live for 100 years inside a coffin. 🤣"
fda reported not enough data shown for booster shots efficacy & safety
"clarilyn lim  mainly because only 1% of the world is vaccinated.  those poorer, developing countries can't afford to be vaccinated for now.. the saying goes.. everyone needs to be well for the world to be well.  we also have these antivaxxers with mindset of people in the  poorer, developing countries."
"no see coffin, no shed tears"
hide in a hole is also shedding tears  which is worst?
justfair he want to be safe from the virus and live till 100 years old inside a coffin. 🤣
allen chua  haha good  one bro👍 these people are scared and showing their fear here. they only know how to blame govt. in fact bullying. what kind of people these people are?  wonder can call them people or not.
"justfair  exactly... even they got constipation also blame government. they ask opposition parties for solution. the opposition parties also say ""vaccination and open the border."" simple for them la. they can move to n korea.. under kim jong un.. he sure give them free citizenship. their border is closed forever so safe from covid 19 forever and on one dare to complain the government. 🤣 so mean they are happy. 🤣🤣🤣 they can live there happily ever after."
"allen chua  yes, they are habitual whiners.nothing is enough for them. very sad because they do not know what's happening in the world. like tortoises living under the shell. they will spite and mock. under achievers who missed out the good times of spore"
"no country can stay closed and yet achieve economy sustainability. perhaps only n korea who doesn't even have an economy.  china will ultimately open up too. the world is all linked, supply chains, trade, etc these guys don't know and don't care"
"justfair yes.. they got the government to thank for having this luxury... easily seen they are still surviving happily during lockdown and border closure. but they don't know they will also suffer the chain effect if this closure prolong...  poorer countries... for example our next door neighbours,  malaysia, philippines and indonesia.. the people are begging for economy to open just to put food on the table. most importantly, the vaccine already proven it is effective enough for the economy to reopen. look at the sports star playing in full packed stadium and arena.. all ok all healthy and all happy."
"allen chua  i agree with you. these are weaklings.they do not know what's happening in malaysia, philippines  and indonesia. tortoise mentality  and they really think the world owes them a living"
"justfair  1. sustainability - why our pioneers decide to have foreign reserve? they are meant for rainy days like this pandemic. even with zero growth, our reserve have no problem feeding our people for the next 50 years. 2. know how these 2 new variant, alpha and delta occurred and spread to the rest of the world causing our current state today? india and uk initially adopted the same ""herd immunity"" policy and that caused these new break-thru variants that haunt the world. we, singapore, will soon have our our singapore variant that help keep the virus alive and spread to the rest of the world. if countries adopt such ""herd immunity"" measure, covid will be a never-ending pandemic as new variant will keeps surfacing.  3. economy - look at the long run, the world economy will crush if it is always haunted by new and more deadly variant. (more deadly variant are bound to surface in each evolution) so, shouldn't we sacrifice our economy temporarily to achieve long term gain? people who support ""herd immunity"" are ignorant. covid virus is a whole new and totally different species from any other flu virus"
allen chua you and justfair are employed pappy keyboard warriors......only the two of you rebuke my comment....very obvious;;;;;heheheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"focus  peope who rebuke your comments are pappies?how narrow minded and self centred you are. the reserves are saved for rainy days .i agree. but its not a never ending tap. we have responsibility to the next generations. moreover, keep tapping from the reserves will make the principle smaller whichever less risks adverse investments which means less returns.and do you know that spore is running a budget dedicit for many years. meaning the revenues ( corp tax, personal income tax, property tax, stamp duties, customs and excise, coe, road tax, etc cannot cover our expenditure.we need 50% of our nirc to balance the budget. so just digging the reserves and make it smaller? how to get the 50% of nirc for budget?"
justfair if current generation can't survive due to decision makers mistake. where got future generation?
focus  sacrifice my son. cannot be so selfish as if the world is only about you. that's why we need nation building. must be able to see 3inches far.
"if everyone thinks like you based on "" self"" and me and myself, the country is finished"
"justfair yes, you're right. keeps importing, opening, easing and you'll find that we all can bring our foreign reserve into our coffins before it can be utilize..."
"focus  wrong. you don't understand what spore is.without the investors here making us global and regional hqs, we would be reduced to a fishing village.and you don't even have your own chilli to mix with rice to makan"
justfair i've read the comments. well said.
"justfair guess you don't really know much about singapore. due to our strategical location, which currently no other country can replace, we have no problem feeding our people. our success is base on our island location and pioneers hard work. not which party is leading singapore. as long as we keep on making good use of our good location, and that kra canal (thailand） isn't in operation, we would have no problem making a living. people who oppose lock down are the rich and politicians, cos that wud affect their wallet. bear this in mind.  drop in profit and value of their assets are inacceptable."
"patry pat wow, all of sudden pappies garnered likes???? errrr........lolx, we all know why."
"focus  nothing is cast in the stone. a good geographical location means nothing without a good govt, security , infrastructure and agile manpower. we would just be like a batam or bintang. and obviously you are not aware that peace cannot be http://free.you/free.you need a strong govt and a good defence force. and challenges are coming like the bri who will be taking away our marine business.  nothing is everlasting and we should protect our strengths"
patry pat  thanks
focus say what you like. short sighted fellow
"focus no investment will come in if you remain close. even how much reserves we have, will one day dry up if we keep on drawing out without replacing it. where do our reserves come from, do you know? its from our open economy where  investments can flow into singapore pre-covid time before you say that i’m a pappy, i didn’t vote for pap in the last election. however we cannot discount the fact that it is they who lead singapore to what it is today, from 3rd world country to 1st world country and raise the  standard of living for you and me else we are still in the 1950s era. so due credit must be given to the pap. strategic location, yes we have. however if we are close indefinitely with no activities, nothing will happen, no trade, no funds and we are just an empty shell. according to marine insight, shanghai has already become the no 1 busiest  port in the world overtaking singapore."
"summer gal agreed, but not in our living years, our reserve can last singapore two generation if properly allocated.."
"patry pat opening up without deep and thorough consideration are clearly short sight, not vice versa. fact is, infected cases have rise from single digit to current 4 digit since easing of measure from aug. not only our ppl suffer, but we brought this disaster to other country like china. how many lives have to be sacrifice before they realize their mistake? and, i am sure a new and more deadly variant will evolve bcos of this stupid mistake."
focus any good suggestion from you?
focus 2 generation cannot lah! we’ll be lucky if can last 5 years
"if i am the finance minister, i can. get rid off unnecessary free loaders like pr, new citizens. redistribution of wealth like what xjp did, retrench unnecessary benchwarmers, drastically reduce number of minister and their pay to match commoner, reduce number of law enforcers by half (as compare to hk, we have twice the number of police officers but 2mil less in population)......and many more. remember, ideas are always more than problems."
"focus first of all, let me ask you. have you do any research before your ideas pop? what are the conseqences? what are the implications? not so easy. many things are in grey area and it takes time to resolve. you have to compare an apple to an apple and not a watermelon"
"focus good.. but have you thought thru the implication of your suggestion, the practicality and feasibility as well as the economic and social impact of each of your recommendation?"
"​summer gal one can't have best of both world, especially during current situation. 鱼与熊掌不可兼得。 a temporary lockdown would put singapore in a better position to achieve future growth. easing, tightening, easing, and then tightening will bring us nowhere. bite the bullet, we will be the first to recover. or, adopt a 50-50 half-cooked approach. which wouldyouprefer?"
"patry pat ​one can't have best of both world, especially during current situation. 鱼与熊掌不可兼得。 a temporary lockdown would put singapore in a better position to achieve future growth. easing, tightening, easing, and then tightening will bring us nowhere. bite the bullet, we will be the first to recover. or, adopt a 50-50 half-cooked approach. which wouldyouprefer?"
focusin your opinion what is the timeframe of the lockdown? how long is sufficient to consider as safe for everyone? and what will take place after the lockdown?
"summer gal refer to my previous reply. btw, look at uncle sam, look at boris johnson, look at xjp. us & uk basically adopted what singapore is practicing now, how is their current situation? they don't need import case to boost their numbers, their own community cases already killing them. now, look at china, if not becos of singapore (imported) , they would be able to maintain their 0 case record."
i hope singapore open by 2250..
"hawkers and fnb how to survive until then with covid. open 6mth close 6mths + 25-50% capacity. $20 cup of kopi quite possible. at that price you might as well make kopi at home and carry and thermal flask. in fact, we should do it now, cook at home, eat at home, no take aways. stay safe, stay health ... go into pandemic robust industries (eg fully automated manufacturing, info com, banking finance remote operations). 50% of all fnb will go bankrupt by end next year if covid is still around causing this level of mayhem/disruption. you see certain food courts and hawker stalls (some as many as 3/4) totally not reopening already after some deep cleaning scare. don't know where bankrupt or don't want to take financial risk (because if your reopen .. you order stock for food supplies then suddenly 2-3 days later lockdown/covid closure). so many stalls got played out, pre-order food for reopening ... suddenly not as much customers the first few days ... suddenly deep clean bs. in the end lose $1000s of dollars on supplies you can't sell (literally thrown away, yeah talk about food waste). that has been the sad story of most of our hawkers over the last year."
cv hawkeye that’s the reality we need to address immediately. either we die through virus infection or we die by suicide or we die and become hungry ghost
"summer gal  well written. life is about choices. we can't have all the good choices every time when faced with these not so good choices created by the virus, we should take the best one and be ready for the battle to earn back normalcy.well can't be like before, follow our leaders to get the best out of a bad situation"
good the world can’t go on like this anymore for such a mild ‘virus’
vaccine works hor?
vaccines is not 100% but life cannot be 100% guaranteed if we closed
rs lin this is how a failure is been brain wash!
ong ernie  now living with the virus doesn't mean we pretend they are not around just face them with precautions
what about incubating patients who test negative on arrival and subsequently test positive? more mixing of the gene pool means increased chances of new variants. do the opening slowly
how do you not see that they are opening slowly? snail's pace.
is israel traveller part of the opening for green lane?

vincecarlo well... lap dog is better than stray dogs.. oh yes.. stray dogs don't get vaccinated and hate vaccination. they roam along the street barking making a lot of noises and spread diseases... and even rabies..  enjoy! stray dogs... 🐕 🤣🤣🤣 hope someone will spay these stray dogs then give them some food. don't let them multiply.
"while it's good to get more of these vaccinated travel lanes opened,  but with cases now rising (or who knows maybe another set of alerts kick in, last minute as usual), who'd feel safe and relaxed enough to come? can't even organize outings with local friends as they are all scared to go out right now. (rightly so) if they talk about opening it when this spike has come down,  for sure."
"red carpet welcome lambda n mu; both resistant to vaccines. booster jab ain't gonna save u, just put ur life at higher risk"
"vincecarlo i agree to a certain degree. opening carefully is important, rather than believing only in vaccines, which are not strong enough to cope with different variants. at first the concept of living with covid-19 as endemic sounds ok, but how it's executed leaves a lot to be desired."
cases rising but you should be asking how many are critically ill. having it circulate around the community isn't a terrible thing if one only experiences mild symptoms. singapore can't stay shuttered. first steps are scary for singaporeans. i know.
"mike alessi thanks for the insight, next few weeks we'll know how the cases of severely ill are going? it will be reflected in the hospital system. i'm hoping things would be good by before xmas, so that we can all celebrate more happily (in small groups of coz)"
"wong francis prolonged lockdown have proven to impact on mental health.. depression, suicides and divorce skyrocket during the pandemic lockdown. these effect are as worse or even much worse than being infected.. look on the bright side.. look at football stadium in europe now.. packed and no social distancing with people cheering... unmasked look at us basketball nba and even wwe. the arenas are full and same thing.. no safety measure.. all along our government controlled this virus very well..  so when the economy opened up and social interaction are more.. the infection rate will increase.. this is the norm.. but most of us compared this norm with the earlier situation where the virus are controlled so we see a surge.. the bottomline is vaccination had proven that infected people are less prone to serious dieases and symptoms."
"allen chua i was thinking,  if we are vaccinated and still kana,  it's kind of like a “booster” shot for our bodies right? maybe it's not so bad after all, of coz nobody likes to get it. so long as we are all vaccinated and keep our symptoms to the minimum,  the world could indeed open up more...."
please dont open until 2030
wat abt tourism  which is also  a major  foreign  income.
good one.
panjimittai tourist can visit other  countries that are open

this whole covid fiasco will fgo down in history as the biggest lie to humanity and all politicians who took part in it will be held fully accountable to 'the' crime against humanity!

"patrick goh  you do know math right. there're only 10% or less of you anti-vaxxers. even if you gather everyone to support your cause, it still wouldn't be enough. good luck 😂"
keep voting pap ...this is what you all get  ...
"cases spike to 19k, omicron came through changi  before the spike, now the narrative is cases are too high for existing measures, so let's open up further. getting safer?"
what’s the proportion of partially vaxed here?  why did they stop after one jab?  they are obviously not anti-vax.
"pro vax, anti-vax or don't care vax all not relevant. what is relevant is absolute compliance. failure of which means you're are marginalized. excommunicated like in middle age europe."

i wore mask everyday also kena covid after staying home 5 days later test negative but it infected to the next person in my family member . this is what singaporean going to suffer at this moment.👏👏👏
still talking.
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere the world. god bless singapore.

hold this conference to tell me you are now doing in depth review to spring clean house rules? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯🤯🤯
you can mask our faces but never our hearts and minds.
we waste so much time n money maintaining a department of anti-scammer goons that tellsyouto take care of yourself!!!! a simple effective solution is passing a law that scamming against singaporean is a death sentence for scammers of any nationals scamming from any country and our most intelligent government with organise an anti-scammers unit that will travel to scammer’s home country to either arrest them or just terminate them right there! and notify the world through united nations of our law!
"now is the opposite. you don't get scammed you're sentenced to quarantine, you lost your job etc etc. that's when scammers hijacked the highest seat of power."
"masyarakat mesti bebas untuk memilih kaedah rawatan yang dirasakan terbaik dan doktor harus diberikan kebebasan dalam merawat pesakit. kejiranan, komuniti masyarakat tempatan mesti menguruskan diri sendiri dengan autonomi atau mandat daripada pihak yang dipilih dan bergelar wakil rakyat. kerajaan pusat tidak boleh lagi dibiarkan menentukan kehidupan dan keselamatan rakyat di atas nama “kesihatan”."
"kerajaan tak boleh diberi kuasa tentukan kesihatan rakyat! doktor kerajaan mesti dibawa ke pengadilan di atas segala tindakan dan saranan kesihatan sepanjang tahun 2020 hingga 2022.  “saya berpandukan kepada sains"" satu retorik serta ungkapan mulut sekumpulan doktor yang bermaksud, “saya mengikut perintah""."
"no government should dictate what kind of treatment or who do we seek treatment. now they're basically forcing everyone to seek treatment only from pfizer, mordena, sinovac sinopharm.  these vaccine makers are all owned by the same group of shareholders."
kat mana2 negara semua sama. ini semua persediaan utk the great reset 2030
"many of my fren all got covid even after they took booster, n some of my fren lung damaged, so i wonder what booster has done to them, no guarantee at all"
"real life experience is real science. brought to you from singaporelifeofunvaxxed unlike those fake narratives..... .....hi everyone, thought to share this. yesterday my parents, sister and myself, all got tested positive. my parents are triple boostered, my sister doubled and i'm unjabbed. we are all recovering well. i feel fine after the 2nd day, have some flu like symptoms.  thought to share to let everyone knows my conditions are not anything worse as they claimed to be because i am unjabbed. so have no fear. truth would prevail and the (false) narratives would eventually crumble."
don’t you feel like a muzzled dog with the mask on?it’s demeaning and cruel to dogs and humans alike?
discarded masks everywhere…maybe that’s how the virus spreads. thanks to masks indeed!
singapore famous for roti prata policy..
percentage of death due to covid. is norm. like old age and accident or cancer terminal stage..
"problem is singaporep gov’t has already started to ease many restrictions, adopted a mis-conceived “live w the virus” policy! 👎 leading to many self-relax of covid-19 “habitat” — seeing more ppl not wearing masks & moving around at hawker centres, bus stops, mrt, etc., posing risks to those who are obliged & responsible! 🙄"

mindless. no common sense at all.
endemic or pandemic now???
"maybe if we wear mask long enough, a flap of skin will form over our mouth and nose… this is the dawn of a new type of homo sapien. the mask prototype, no nose no mouth only eyes and ears."
besides who wants to take picture with the mask on?!! not me i’ll look like a sicko!!!
the mask mandate has taught me to be kinder to my dogs. we have to mask up just like we have to leash our dogs when we go out but i envy my dogs…at least they don’t have to wear masks.
u need to let dogs wear mask too.....any living thing that breathe..........need wear it.......ah bo tio fineeeeeeeeee.......many experts miss out this !
fully agree. moreover your doggy is not mandated to take the experimental jab or its booster also. blessed indeed.
dont envy dogs. they die young about 10 human years. same for the human dogs that like papayas.
3 ministers are responsible for the current dilema. i have been screaming for months not to allow indians into singapore. no one listens.
"yes and those are our money, it can be put to good use such as donations. building park for youth and centre of excellence and recreational for the community. but those money are more focused on scaming the people out of their lives for profit such as bussiness bussiness bussiness. those overpaid ministers are taking our money!"
"the only mandate that the party in power has is the mandate from and of the people. anything that circumscribes that mandate is a breaching of that trust, duty, and accountability. does the moh team answer to the people or the people answer to the team's contrary policies that people are questioning more and more now?"
absolutely agree. when government fear the people there is liberty. when people fear the government there is tyranny. - thomas jefferson
we have become puppets of wef
"jordan tan never trust your wef puppet government ! see austria, they tell at the same moment: ""we will in a few months lift all restrictions & you need a 4th shot!!!!!"" this governments work with all kind of tricks and lies... the say: ""one door we'll soon open and close at the same time ten other doors!"" we have the same situation in germany: they say we will soon lift restrictions and prepare at the same time 4th shot and digital id! just in - austria will lift almost all covid restrictions by march 5, minister of health and social affairs mückstein announced. in addition, a decision on compulsory vaccination is expected by march 15, which may result in a ""temporary suspension."" same time: more - austria's major general striedinger announces the anticipated need for a 4th vaccine injection this fall, with the goal of achieving a 90% vaccination rate in the population."
trust no one. especially you know who.

spot on.
minister ong...well said
you clowns 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
"new zealand omicron wave likely to peak in march with up to 30,000 cases a day, says  jacinda ardern, pime minister of new zealand. prime minister says number of people who get booster vaccines will dictate how high the peak will be. jacinda ardern told rnz, the national radio broadcaster, that she expected new zealand’s cases to peak at between 10,000 and 30,000 cases a day. nearly 67% of 5+ million new zealand’s total population, including children, have received a booster shot; 83% have had at least one dose, and 77% two doses. among the population aged 12 and over, 94% of new zealanders are vaccinated with two doses – but rates are lagging among māori, 86% of whom are double-vaccinated. while the vast majority of the country is vaccinated, some new zealanders continue to object to vaccination, particularly the mandates that affect about 40% of the workforce. new zealand’s high vaccination rates mean some people may not have any symptoms at all. the danger here is that they will still be able to pass on the virus to someone else. the home self-isolation period for cases reduces from 14 days to 10 days, and for contacts from 10 days to seven. the period of self isolation also applies to household members. ""we have seen that 90 percent of household contacts who were going to test positive do so within those first 10 days,"" with omicron, she says, so there are good reasons for the changes. she advises people to develop a home self-isolation plan, including identifying a buddy who can drop off supplies. ardern says the way to handle this omicron period will be the same as previous times - test, vaccinate and isolate if sick."
"japan is the latest country to face the omicron paradox as infections soar but serious illness proportionally declines. it is a challenge for a country that has dodged the worst of the coronavirus, leaving japanese officials scrambling to catch up even as some restrictions are being scaled back. japan is now seeing caseloads soar to record levels. the latest figures show an average of 76,800 new cases each day, double the number from two weeks ago and up from less than 1,000 new cases each day at the start of the year. this is pushing up hospital admissions even as a record 264,000 people nationwide are being told to recover at home. in tokyo, the covid-19 hospitalization rate is just below the 50 percent benchmark for declaring a full state of emergency, although the occupancy rate for wards housing the most critical cases is less than 5 percent."
and yr point?
"south korea on wednesday (feb 16) reported a daily record of 90,443 new omicron cases, as numbers nearly doubled within a week amid the spread of the highly infectious omicron variant. south korean authorities have shifted testing and tracing policy, in line with the less fatal omicron variant's spread, toward self-monitoring and diagnosis and at-home treatment starting this month ( february 2022)."
"obviously, south korean health authority realize where is the cause, and rectify the problem at the root. instead of chasing the tail of the snake like our government here 🤣"
obviously you are selling needles.
"how many suspects , how many left the body, how many recover after issolation. the age of the person who left the body.  compersation for the freedom lost during covit, anyone paying w.h.o. pubic need answer."
"ask the funeral parlors. singapore casket advertises 10 mins on yt  for its grand services, obviously competition is great.  unbelievable, to the elderly, its a jinx to watch ⚰️, it breaks chinese tradition for $."
"5.11 winter yesterday someone just updated. mandai crematorium 63 slot occupied for that day alone. simply multiplied by 365 faces you an estimate of annual mortality. compared that to the average of 21,000 to 22,000 since 2018. and this is only from one crematorium. there is another 2 plus one public burial service dedicated for muslim. so guess what's the excess mortality of 2021 until now."
"import, import virus in then those mild symptoms can go home then pass it to your family members then the family members went out to public pass it to others!!!🤦🤦🤦 don't know what pap is doing!!! because we have already vaccines so get virus is your business already!!! not their business any more!!!"
roti prata kosong!!!
"can we just admit that the mmtf have been fooled by pfizer/moderna/etc? from 80% vaccination to return to normal, we slowly lost the battle as they put their faith in an experimental drug with no long term safety data. don't forget how they never highlight the risks. only benefits."
"many of my friends , have coronavirus , thank to the pfe vaccine they got ,, it help them fight the virus 🦠, now everyone is ok , thank you pfizer .."
wen hui wong your comment has nothing to do with what i said. here's the question you need to ask: are the vaccines the only thing that can reduce severity of disease?
"demonthatgotlordkeith it helps reduce in reducing the severity of the symptoms, so take your booster when its offered to u. and the severity of the omicron is lower in vaccinated individuals compared to the earlier strains in 2020, because of the vaccines"
wen hui wong not answering the question: are these vaccines the only way to reduce severity of infections? yes or no?
"demonthatgotlordkeith yesyousee so many singaporeans eating and shopping despite the high number of case, thats because most infection are mild in vacccinated individuals and nobody cares about covid anymore because covid isnt a threat anymore in vaccinated individuals"
demonthatgotlordkeith doyouwant to be treated like a criminal and an outcast by 80-90% of the vax population ifyouarent vaxxed and boostered?
"wen hui wong your statement is not entirely true. it's abundantly clear that covid mortality rate is based on immune function and not vaccination status. if that was the case, everyone who had covid before the vaccines were rolled out would be severely ill, which isn't the case. omicron is also less lethal than delta, so to attribute what's happening in singapore (which honestly is nothing to write home about) entirely to the jabs is incorrect."
wen hui wong the fact that you think it's okay for unvaccinated people to be treated like outcast is exactly what's wrong with world. you think by listening to 160 you're somehow super updated and know what's going on when in fact you've been fooled all this while. 85% fully vaccinated and still cannot return to normal. let that sink in before you type your next ib response.
"demonthatgotlordkeith you do know math right. there're only 10% or less of you anti-vaxxers. even if you gather everyone to support your cause, it still wouldn't be enough. good luck 😂"
demonthatgotlordkeith yeah you can still get it but you are 90% less likely to die from it. why don't people read?
wen hui wong don'tt read? who's the one not answering the initial question: are these vaccines the only option to reduce severity of illness? after 3 messages you finally answered incorrectly by saying yes. lol. enjoy your jabs. if you suffer any adverse reaction you certainly won't be missed.
"demonthatgotlordkeithyouare totally lame. why don't you just come out and say you are anti-vaccine, anti-mask and anti-lockdown during the pandemic? your are being cowardly. if that is what your talking about just say it."
"it's most fortunate that the task force members are responsible, competent and morally upright and do not tell blatant lies. bravo to the capable s'pore govt. 👍👍"
"competent? if they were really competent and implement early treatment like ron de santis in florida, we'd have gone back to normal by last year. get your head out of their ass."
stop sucking up in the comments pls anzia
clown ong
i also wonder if the mask mandate caused more people to chain-smoke or pick up smoking cos they get to drop their masks when they take a puff. a much needed break! so one vice led to another.
"you kidding? there are healthier ways to take a mask break, eg. exercise or even dine in allows you to take off the mask."
totally ridiculous and no link. if ppl wanted to smoke they do not need to hav to use covid/masks as a reason to do so.
"true enough. when people want to take a break from that damn mask forcing upon them, they would subconsciously seek all reason to remove it. i would simply remove it when i am outside their boundary."
i wonder if there will a new mental disorder developing from this pandemic - maskuphobia (the extreme fear of wearing masks) or unmaskuphobia (the extreme fear of not wearing  masks). either way it’s driving us nuts!
it's going war for human souls. we are in the end times. 🙏 turn to the lord before it's too late.. 🙏 jesus is the only way to god and heaven.
"its endtimes too for buddhists, awaiting arrival of lord maitreya. many churches, mosques and temples have been vaxxxed! whats left are the bibles and sutras, when they are gone, lord cometh. you too , with your lord jesus, sir."
"just imagine… mask on sit here, mask off sit there…mask on stand here, mask off stand there. we look like idiots to the world🙀"
61% voted for 🎪🤡
"yeah we are. ny times wrote an article about singapore saying our govt got ""cold feet"". embarrassing."
absolutely agree 👍👍 those who are awakened and uprighteous would naturally feel such shame and do what they can to shun it. whereas those dishonourable would forever try to coverup for their master.
fomo
"so when can we get rid of safe entry app? serves no purpose other than to monitor our movements. was needed last year, but pointless now as vaxxed and unvaxxed get covid and can just stay home for 3 days. why not at least make it so no mask is needed when outside, like the rest of the world. singapore want the record for longest mask wearing?"
"mask mandate will probably be removed just before the next election. then everybody will be so grateful to have their faces, smiles, voices, oxygen (not to mention spirit back) and vote for the ruling party! so clever!"
"forcing boosters on people is unfair and unethical. people received their vaccinations. and you are flagging them ""unvaccinated"". that seems unreasonable."
it is time for a change in government.
"if you have over 20,000 cases a day without 'any sign' that icu beds are lacking, it means that masks and vaccines should not be forced on the people. lift those ridiculous restrictions. leave peoples' decisions about their own safety to themselves."
ikr
let’s wait for a couple of weeks. it rises to 3 digits. sometimes it’s like saying leave peoples decisions to themselves on the road and let them drive as fast as they want.
"firefox rocks yes. and how many car crashes do you get in singapore? this government is addicted to power. we're setting a very dangerous precedent by continuing restrictions and mandates when they have long become counterproductive. 20,000 cases a day and no healthcare emergency. if you do some math.. the only reason covid is still a pandemic in singapore, is because of the restrictions."
👏👏👏
"ht with or without traffic rules, with traffic rules, minimal, without it will be a lot more. driving fast will not only harm oneself but also others.i’m willing to take some risks but other might not. i think there’s a safer time to open up fully"
"firefox rocks  when i see your comment i am so glad lah see many people don't understand lah my ah loong make decision very careful lah that's why he handpicked all his chief lieutenants to the mtf lah whatever decisions they make good or bad just take it lah you let ordinary people make their healthcare decisions cannot lah how to grow your cpf money and make my temasek prosper  all depends on sharing profits with the drug makers lah like people always say lah die one million only statistic lah only counting $$$ safest lah for your wonderful comment, you are rewarded a family-packed of e-masks, courtesy of e-temasek"
absolute power corrupts absolutely
"so when no one is within my eyesight, i can opt not to put on the mask?"
"20k per day, 7 days = 140k, 10 weeks = 1.4m, most of the population assuming it will double soon."
is it compulsory? doctor doctor : ask your government?
"let everyone get it on purpose so we're all technically immune. no scientist has managed to find something more efficient than what the human body can produce to combat viruses. why fight against natural selection? if humans can't even survive covid-19, think of what the next one will do. the people that will die from it even after getting vaccinated, it just means they're not biologically feasible to survive on this planet. singapore should have its own crispr trials if it really wants to improve life expectancy."
wait till the fatalities up to 100 per day then these people wake up. they just like to play with human lifes.
"there could be 100 - 200 fatalities everyday, but if they're not categorised as covid, it won't be reported. how many people died of heart failure, stroke, heart inflammation etc everyday ? only the funeral parlor operators know."
"if you still need a booster after being fully vaccinated, and still need to get tested after being fully vaccinated, and still need to wear a mask after being fully vaccinated, and still get hospitalized after being fully vaccinated ... it's probably time you admitted that you have been fully conned."
absolutely timely reminder to all. we need kind people like you to pull out those who unwittingly bring themselves nor their loved one into the mouth of the tiger 🐯.
good reminder to all who are still asleep.
"many of my friends , have coronavirus , thank to the pfe vaccine they got ,, it help them fight the virus 🦠, now everyone is ok , thank you pfizer .."
"yawn.. other countries have already opened up but our mainstream media is not reporting. isn’t that truly living with the virus? btw, i hope oyk’s art test is accurate.. he sounds a little sick."
will there be a cop for mtf?
clowns of privilege...???
"wish this could become a reality one day. but in such an autocratic regime, that's hard to imagine."
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
anyone know if singapore is statistically the worse in the world on a number of rules to % number of cases per population?
can chandru b team inforner to get medicine
now the unboosted though protected are made the enemy. clearly they trusted the vaccine and now don't because they see it has little impact with omnicron nor is potentially safe as was first assumed.
they say doctors and nurses wear masks so they must work but we are not doctors and nurses! we are regular folks so stop acting like one! give us our humanity back!
totally agree with you. let us take back our rights to live life as we used to live. we need to gather all those like minded people like the canadian truckers in freedom convoy 2022.
"in spite of the mask mandate, cases are still sky high…they say that’s because people are not wearing their masks properly…what about the flip side which is masks simply do not work! think!"
that just proves that masks should not be forced upon the public at large but restricted only to healthcare frontliners.
"those 21,000 who steadfastly refused the booster jab are awakened one. congratulations 👏🎇👏"
good news to all who steadfastly fight back on vaccine mandate.
"no, they are foolish. let’s wait and see."
"no, they’re endangering themselves and others and shouldn’t be so selfish."
"no they are now the new enemy, 80%-90% of singapore population supported the vax and are pro-big pharma"
"joe pickford when i see your comment i am so glad lah these people are sooo soooooo selfish lah they don't know we had armed ourselves with the smartest anti-covid drug lah it's called mrna vaccine lah you know how much effort and resources our business partner pfizer use to develop this amazing drug lah it's like computer sofware lah we have a dedicated team to update the software lah every time new variants come out our team simply need to re-compile the code lah then come a new anti-covid vaccine lah wah biang ah ! still got people out there who reject our good effort i strongly recommend my ah loong to implement new laws to send them to changi quarantine centre lah for your selfless advice, you are rewarded with a family-packed of anti-viral anti-microbial e-masks,  courtesy of e-temasek."
"wen hui wong  wah biang ah, you are so smart lah this people want to become enemy of the state lah they want to use their grandmother self-remedy lah what all kind of nonsense natural food natural remedy lah while we are progressively moving forward to new mrna future ready lah that is why my temasek invested in so many bio-tech startup lah if these guys have their ways, then all my startup mati lah so those who refuse booster must revoke their vax status lah if all my bio-tech investment prosper, then only singapore can prosper lah so simple logic lah for your socially responsible advice, you are rewarded with a family-packed of anti-viral anti-microbial e-masks,  courtesy of e-temasek."
ho ching global covid university let natural selection take care of those unvax ppl.
ho ching global covid university so all those pro-vax trolls must be graduated from your much discredited ho ching global covid university. dispensing all kinds of malicious experimental jab propaganda.
"ho ching global covid university its not about whether these people 'choose' to be the enemy of state or not. if the state and 80-90% of the vax population deemsyouas the enemy for not being vaxxed, that meansyouare the enemy."
"why after simplify still complex?? safe distancing not required during mask on, meaning it’s required when mask off. lol. seriously i dun have time micro manage this kinda microscope details, and if you observe orchard road nobody does either. i have stopped reading protocols since hr kicked off and just pray hard dun catch corrveed. much easier this way"
"no worries, singapore only have that many people... soon all will get it and done"
actually true
last week our company asked us to return to office. after a week we found out that 2 of our colleague are covid positive now some of us are sick and positive. is there an sanction for these companies that seems doing trial and error if its safe to go back to work and risking our health?
yah its better to work from home by default rather than back to office all sick and cannot work.
singapore authority and health science authority must never never think that the omicron corona virus not very dangerous but if the delta corona virus will to combined will be delta crom will be very threatening to more human lives loss and more death will rise and health care will be overwhelmed. singapore authority and health science authority must immediately acts to prevent the delta and omicron corona virus to combined to spread in the community.

sang nila utama pendekar natural remedy is definitely better that the experimental vaccine.  dump the poison 💉💉
i think blood thinning drugs would be more helpful in coming months.
ahem...... not profitable! antiviral with 62% clinical efficacy... highly safe and affordable otc drug... ahem cough cough!!
"ivermectin not dead 🤣. actually the main concern for us was the healthcare capacity. after 2 years, we have found that natural immunity wins the race as it has always been. if the healthcare capacity is a concern, why not encourage and re-educate us on how to boost our natural immunity? and leave the vaccines to the vulnerable (which is a minuscule minority)? rather than hantam all of us assuming everyone is vulnerable? the other day i saw a forwarded whatsapp message addressed by dr. v balakrishnan, saying we need to get infected to gain natural immune response. from layman to dr, we don’t need to get infected to gain immune response. we need exposure. just being exposed is enough to stimulate antibody and t cell response. the health ministries around the world have brushed aside vaers. this shows they dont know what is happening on the ground level and they don’t care. there are always steps to verify the vaers reports. i hope that whatsapp msingapore wasn’t really from dr balakrishnan as it convey lack of immunology knowledge."
20k a day 🤦
"jus have to rem these goodus will put $ economy first before everything else, that's including your life & livelihood, which mean they only listen to what other leaders instructed them to better be a good boy to continue draw millions than standing up for their own fellow citizens. singapore got no true leaders. jus puppets"

how come dislikes numbers not shown again again  again...
nothing surprise when ppl are shoulder to shoulder in the crowded bus. with more than 40 passengers with mask on. like it has been 2 yrs. and they restrict not more than 5 visitors and dine in. 😂
"masks do not protect us, it only gives a false sense of security. masks kill us inside out and eats away our humanity making all of us faceless mindless individuals. don’t you get it?! it’s time to stop this insanity!"
"hanya masuk mrt, bas, kedai saje pakai. cukup dah. kat luar saya memang tak pakai mask. buat apa menyusahkan diri. yang nak pakai tu silakan saje."

"the new thebatman movie, out on march 3rd"
stop suffocating all of us with your stupid mask mandate!!!
when will the mask mandate be removed?!
"they will bring this matter up in their next ge speech. and looking back past years,  what a failure they had been. 😂"
"let us all begin it from ourselves. those who shared our views would follow eventually. once we grow big like the canadian truckers freedom convoy scale, they can't stop us anymore."
clueless & overpaid govt..
what do you expect from singaporeans?
garrison r not all singaporeans voted them.  it's new and seniors citizens who still think highly of them. new generation don't  need to know about the past.  that era is long gone.  now gen z era.
"let cases expectedly spike for cny, use other festivities to clamp down numbers, rinse and repeat."
money laundering is for cleaning illegal acquired income. now we have covid data laundering for hiding those evidence of medical fraud.
nbcb... i got my covid last friday. today feeling better. when is your turn...?
serious bo? what symptoms? vaxed?
still stuck in our “worst of both worlds” situation. high levels of restrictions and high case numbers. only the world’s “best” politicians can achieve such a feat. 🤡🤡🤡
"if non-singapore politician laughs at our ministers for the high $$$ during covid, this shows that our ministers had mismanaged the entire situation since 2019, and don't deserve the high $$$."
as we all witnessing what they've been doing. micro managing every single movement of the citizens in the name of covid. the lost track of the plot and are spending all thier time and effort covering up their backside. all the salary and budget now is spend on that one purpose. isn't that for this alone to call them a bunch of circus clown 🤡🤡🤡?
"alfa proto yes and those are our money, it can be put to good use such as donations. building park for youth and centre of excellence and recreational for the community. but those money are more focused on scaming the people out of their lives for profit such as bussiness bussiness bussiness. those overpaid ministers are taking our money!"
it's all because of wef
jordan tan well said. from there it spawned off the agenda 21/2030 and the global youth leadership program. we have many singaporean youths who are part of this program.
still got children under 5 yo not vaccinated ..
so how tis coming hari raya?
forget abt the govt. just do what you like!
you know the drill 😄

my family starts posivitive despite boosters wtf
i'm too get bosster still kena hmmmm
they say wat they like they owned  us. vote wisely.
"your family get positive is due to the booster itself. you're innoculated !  i don't get it even in close contact, without wearing mask at home when my son was covid positive with full blown symptoms. why ?? because until today, i am still unvaccinated."
"yazi mohd gitulah. mula mula kita ni senang diperdaya. tapi bila masa dah panjang, orang semua sadar. ngak mahu diperdaya kan lagi."
some studies show booster increase the chance of catching it refer to fourth booster and israel and eu studies.
"&gt;gets 10 covid shots &gt;""why is it not working? why does my heart feel funny?"""
"to the guy who is proud of being unvaccinated… good luck. you get covid, we wait and see. if you afterwards die or end up in icu, you will learn one way or another."
"hang tuah hastinapura this comment is seriously potent 😆. im happy for you that you are able to stand your ground, unlike alot of us who had to get the shots out of great reluctance. ""hold the line"" 🤣 spirit of canada!"
zhd1987e nope. by now he has already developed antibodies and t cell responses due to exposure - his son's symptomatic infection. his protection is much greater than all of us tripple vaxxers.
peter chew hope it's an eye opener to the new and old generation. we are no longer living in the 70's.
zhd1987e my whole house got infected with covid recently. the rest of the family are vaccinated except me. guess what? my symptoms are the least among us and i recovered the fastest. natural immunity my friend.
"cs tan like everyone else who wish to stay out of the jab, i thought one way is to seek out the legal loophole to get myself infected and upload my data. but no matter how hard i try to get it from my infected son, nothing happens. so those who keep parroting others on how infectious the variants  simply lend evidence to the fact that they got infected is because their natural immunity is weakened by the jab. especially those repeated jab. my son got it from the army camp after returning back from cny holiday. he received his full vaccinated status only one month ago. but his symptoms is far from mild - serious headache, sore throat, night sweats and high fever. took him 5 days to recover. the fact that his sense of taste still intact means very likely he like everyone else from his camp all infected with omicron variant. conclusion is obvious. this is my personal experience not based on some high sounded medical research paper. for ordinary people with normal healthy immune system this just prove how mother nature take care of itself."
"jamil m good for you! however, not every unvaccinated person will recover the same way as you. ...and that serious illness is <b>statistically</b> more likely to happen to unvaccinated people. you <b>just so happen</b> to get mild symptoms, much like a vaccinated person who <b>just so happen</b> to get severe symptoms.  if the vaccine is really a cover-up, then government would launch an investigation to why there is abnormally high case counts."
"hang tuah hastinapura in that case, good for you. you <b>just so happen</b> to get mild or no symptoms. however, unvaccinated people have a much higher chance of getting covid with worse symptoms. count yourself lucky due to circumstance!"
"jamil m absolutely agree. this is the same experience i gathered from friends who had bot vaccinated and unvaccinated in the same household. my son got infected with omicron but i won't considered it very mild. yet he is only fully vaccinated one month ago. according to all the moh scientific data, the pfizer antibodies supposedly still very high. so all those moh data cannot be rely upon."

how to get answers when they're still running in circles?
"it will never end. there will be more variants and all, but its unlikely we will enter another lockdown like senario"
never mind can compete with malaysia
"malaysia covid cases today at record breaking 27,831 but only 93 cases are serious, so also no need to worry la as long as vaccinated and boosted."
why need to compete ? sounds really foolish to compete on some fraudulent statistics based on fraudulent test kit dictated by fraudulent politicians.

still have singaporean expect government to ease restrictions at present moment?
only those papies who like to polish their master shoes will do.
"poke n poke jab n jab countries already lifting all vaccine mandates  denmark denmark has lifted all restrictions, vaccination n isolation laws  treating it nothing more than common cold uk uk has abolished vaccine mandate, mask n testing to live with covid-19. india india rules out mandatory covid-19 vaccines, take a look at countries making it compulsory. this declaration is in sync with the world health organization’s (who) stance that vaccine mandates shouldn’t come into force. czech “new czech government dismisses mandate vaccination plan. we’ve agreed that vaccination against covid-19 won’t be mandatory"""
when are we going to open up 100% since covid cases are raising everyday with restrictions?
this wave infections will takes 4-6 weeks to come down
ya ask yourself why cases climbing now kiddos that took vexsin add on to the numbers v e x s i n  = cyoul p r i t
they literally 💉💉 the infectious agents into their body. who to blame ?
"singapore cases will hit 50,000 by end of this week or 100,000 by end of next week"
tak hairanlah. tapi orang tentu hairan bila pemerintah ngomong omicron tu takde apa-apa tapi rumah sakit penuh sesak. dokter jururawat semua kerja sampai pengsan. jadi siapa yang sakit teruk ni ? puncanya apa kalo bukan omicron ? renungkan lah saudara saudari yang bijaksana.
"imagine only 1% need to be hospitalised. just for 2 consecutive weeks, what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system ? no kidding, just a repeat of new york 2020."
perfect  herd immunity  stop nonsense rubbish mrna jabs
i think you are obviously missing out the fact that there is only 6m people in singapore...
i guess the plan is get everyone infected first then achieve herd immunity. then won’t need the continuous jabs which is costing the government.
if no reach...........u cut off your kkj ? ?? ?
today 17 february there are 65 cremations scheduled in just mandai crematorium alone.  only mandai is public and owned by gov to fulfill all cremations required  2 more private ones and 1 muslim burial gov agency.  total 4 agencies to handle cremations and burial.  today' cremations of 65 are for deceased who died in the past several days. usually its a lagged indicator.  those who died today will only be cremated after several days of funeral procession.
24220 death in 2021 while in previous years 21282 deaths in 2018 ------------------------------------ excess mortality 2938 not trying to scare everyone but just to reflect what had happened to the past and now. with our choo-choo train being piloted by smart leadership....this year would be very tough also.
"carol catherine i believe there will be no herd immunity against this virus from my observations in florida, usa ... i know of people who had sever symptoms and hospitalized for a week.  they should have had very strong immunity, but became reinfected with omicron though symptoms were mild. being infected means it gets transmitted.   we can hope medical science comes up with a possible solution, but for now, immunity is limited regardless of whether via infection or vaccination.   my advise? put on n95 mask in public and wash hands frequently.  most do not talk about how those infected can have viral material in their feces...in fact, cities in the usa have started monitoring waste treatment plants for this as actually faster in alerting of the transmission than testing people who volunteer to be tested. so, now you understand the shift in public mind set....vaccines lower severity of symptoms... wearing n95 mask properly may, may help deter transmission, but only in public spaces, not amoung family living in the same house."
"real life experience is real science. brought to you from singaporelifeofunvaxxed unlike those fake narratives..... .....hi everyone, thought to share this. yesterday my parents, sister and myself, all got tested positive. my parents are triple boostered, my sister doubled and i'm unjabbed. we are all recovering well. i feel fine after the 2nd day, have some flu like symptoms.  thought to share to let everyone knows my conditions are not anything worse as they claimed to be because i am unjabbed. so have no fear. truth would prevail and the (false) narratives would eventually crumble."
d. kinzie there is actually no way to avoid this virus unless one or one’s family members don’t leave the house at all. i actually don’t believe anyone can have immunity from omicron since it reinfects the recovered too.
"these days, trust cannot be simply granted."
"what a joke, here are the achievements;. us cdc re-classifies singapore as level 4: covid-19 destination [aka: very high level of infection]."
ttkoh123 see man i too dont trust pap but whenyoujust copy and paste the same comment everyday and comment on ur own comment it kinds of makeyoulook desperate for attention.
"chiu jia yi elderly up lorries everyday and you are worrying about my comments? you better spend times to help build a safer and cleaner environment for everyone instead of being narrowed minded with your view. however in response; same news split into multiple segments is for ""reach"", hence comments can similarly follow as they are relevant; as long as my comment/replies are factual or relevant and befitting to the situation and serving to help the community and complying to the policy, of all you care? you need to use your brain to visualize ""continuation"" or ""consolidation"" for easy viewers reading than you narrowed view."
we all shell not vasinate
"but those 92% already vax. those 21,000 who rejected the booster is worthy of praise."
"umm… no. in fact these unvaccinated people should exercise more caution since the transmissible omicron variant is in force. should stay at home as much as possible! if still do normal activities, good luck. if they get covid hopefully they get mild symptoms. if this turns to worse ones, serve them right."
"imagine if you have other disease like heart disease and you get covid-19, it could  be very serious and not a mild condition. this is what living with covid-19 means, people with disease will suffer like hell."
with so many clot shots administered this is precisely the reason they're expanding the bed capacity. the moh is fully aware since the case of the 16 up boy who suffered myocarditis.
"imagine only 1% need to be hospitalised. just for 2 consecutive weeks, what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system ? no kidding, just a repeat of new york 2020."
0.2% infection fatality rate (ifr) of covid. ebola had 90% ifr. still afraid of a psychological warfare virus?
"winter lantern wake up. these people are lives, your relative, fellow singaporean. they are not mere statistics. if you think money is more important than lives, you are on the wrong path. if you get covid-19 and on hospital bed, your comment will be very different."
petrus romanus ironic how you say we are not mere statistics when the mmtf are using our bodies as kpi on an experimental drug with no long term safety data.
"petrus romanus “one death is a tragedy; one million deaths is a statistic” is one of stalin's most famous quotes. a death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. an elderly person dying of old age is an expectation. similarly are those who had serious or underlying terminal diseases irrespective of age. but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult can certainly be viewed as tragedy. next question is which is more likely to cause tragedy ? experimental vaccine or the virus itself for a child or young heathy adult ? the answer based on past 2 years event is obviously the experimental vaccine."
yes agree with you petrus...that's what i worrying! 😢

scamdemic
no need worry la...youguys say its endemic.. live with it maaahhyouguys say... dont worry laaaa....
"ya lo, spread only mah, heard immunity mah, covid naive mah. strong one survive, weak one die mah, more elder die loh. more up lorry loh. maybe one day those who approved of the decision to open up their elders oso up lorry loh."
only stupid people believe that living with covid-19 can work. live with covid-19 means everyone will be infected by covid-19 and get sick or even die and have long term implication.
politician are being scam by pharmaceutical companies to believe that living with covid-19 can work and now citizen have to keep taking covid-19 jabs.
stop the scammers from keep scamming the people by exposing them.
"these days when pap says ""effective"" i want to laugh."
"the panademic has shown that even a big of experts working together cannot resolve this, not to mention one country government"
"in another words, children and elderly are relegated to another make-shift facilities other than the proper hospital care. as i have said before; elderly are relegated to a shoddy made-shift mass facility instead of a proper hospital environment. looking like a really shoddy made-shift mass facility with no directional air flow/pressure control, for example, turbulent air flow instead of directional negative pressure environment. the elderly/merdeka deserves better treatments and protection for their life-safety example to have high degree of certainty of zero cross-contamination. please respect our elderly better."
"its fk all now.......    i'm sorry that the elders in singapore have to face this. but someone approved vtl, someone stopped quarantine requirements. someone believed in ""covid naive"" theory. there will be more blood, there will be more anger. we are on ur side and we will do something next election."
"honesty & integrity applies to pap & wp. when teaching wp to be honest, did pap did live up to expectation of reducing covid casee? are the current measures honestly effective to the masses or only a single regulator which entire nation had to suffer being infected with it.  ownself say ownself had done well is no use. praising ownself is international disingaporerace. you have lost the integrity of gaining  trust. daily figures are climbing. pse come up with concrete measures to reduce it which is honestly the best solution we would like to witness instead of motherhood statement.  what's the difference of opening up when there is no acute preventive measures of putting the disease at bay. doubtful, if he takes mrt or buses without trace together to trace & check that is so packed like sardines cause rapid spread. sitting on ivory tower calling the shots with million $$$ can his conscience be honest & drawing $$$ with integrity be crystal clear? its just like pot telling pan is black. no difference.  we are only a dot but cases are so high. really shameful. should really stop dining in & no more business as usual. this clearly indicate money greed putting citizen life at risk. must vote wisely"
derrick ang well said; all patriots should stay together.
derrick ang  pap not being honest by supressing other alternative medications.
expired goods ? like end of coe. due for scrap why bother to take care ?
"in 2021, i lost all trust in them; sacrifice life, sacrifice jobs; elderly are relegated to make shift facilities; home recovery instead of proper hospital care and despite the highly infectious variants. what else?"
in 2025 they will tell you they control the covid well in 2021with low death rate. so please vote for them to help you better...😂
"the pharmaceutical companies have take over, they want you to be sick forever because they want to make money and be in power forever. like high blood pressure medicine, you have to keep taking covid-19 vaccine jabs. cancer, hiv, diabetes and many other diseases,  pharmaceutical companies cure almost nothing. they make it a chronic disease like high blood pressure and make money out of it for the long term."
"record high of 19,420 new covid cases in s'pore, over twice the day before + 7 up lorries [15 feb 2022]; i'll say; reckless gambling; like i say, when people trade your means of livelihoods and trade your life-safeties, will you still accept the ""model"" and will you rely your children future with them? what's up 2025?"
"vtl without quarantine, without supervised art test, no need pcr confirmation, open up for imports and worse 7 years of formula one.??? citizens can expect the gst to be hike soon. reckless gambling, reckless spending."

"these days, trust cannot be simply granted. rather than people singing rhetoric on ""trust"", ""honesty"" and ""integrity"", my benchmark on trust is based on achievements example what are seen by the common citizens to have been achieved for example, protection, job security, life safety, standard of living, for example ""performance based"" and not influenced by what people use the mouth to say;  for example;  2 in 3 working singaporeans do not have savings to last them beyond 6 months: ocbc survey. poll results show nearly 50% of high-income earners in singapore face money issues [sjp asia survey]  for example if $8k income per month, pay almost ~ $84,240.00 of gst tax in 5 years. money so dearly for the children and for retirement. do your own maths. during the reign of lky, where?, you may ask did we pay for so much taxes while singapore went on to similarly progresses in big steps to where we were? in another words, singaporeans cannot continue to afford their lavish and expensive ""lifestyles"" and ""reckless"" spending while traded 127 types good paying jobs away and still achieving literally nothing and in return still requiring singaporeans to pay more. if this is not example of failures or fake promises, what is?  in 2021, i lost all trust in them; sacrifice life, sacrifice jobs; elderly are relegated to make shift facilities; home recovery instead of proper hospital care and despite the highly infectious variants.  what do you think?"

two months later... this video didn't age well. :-/
nice vid!
i think i'm blaming the whole singapore covid.
maybe singapore govt should follow the germany way instead of having roti prata new normal.
"question: i've got a sinovac vaccine and if i wanted to travel to germany and i know its not under the recommended vaccine list, how will i enter or what is the possible way or solution in entering germany?"
do you need a covid vaccine and quarantine if you are coming from the us?
steven and diana are the reasons why i’m watching talking point.
to compare germany with a snot like singapore is silly !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo29lfqnyiu&t=17m47s17:47 steven naughty ah see nek nek pokie
this is nice. we get to see how other parts of the world are living now.
"now the  cases are getting higher you still dare to travel ,not my fault if you get covid -19"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo29lfqnyiu&t=5m16s5:16 oh stop being so dramatic steven ! :p
very helpful information for those wanting to travel soon!
woohoo mauritius!
"presenter stay in landed?, mediacorp has a really high pay :)"
"nice, great german beer"
so what happens if you test positive for the flight back?
the worry of being infected with covid and can't come back to singapore without ur love ones withyouwould be a real concern for any traveller. congratz the team for coming back safely!
"to be honest, i was amazed with the beer size!"
"all the tracking, restrictions and procedures - germans seem to love this kind of crap."
"it sure looks wonderful when most of us like myself love travelling but there's a price to pay. look at the additional charges to pay for this and that, you get frighten by it."
so nice you can travel
haha so now traveling is for the rich ass people.
"so, what will happen if the pcr test return as positive before the flight back to singapore? what will be the advice from the german health authority? put on quarantine or hospitalize? steve never ask leh.."
i think govt just wants to avoid this question because it will turn many people away
"wow. so many obstacles. but with the current circumstance, it can't be helped"
"for travelling to the us, depending on the state self quarantine is not mandatory there, so there's kind of a half-vtl."
take both jabs.
may i know if i would need to get quarantine in singapore back from germany if i have not stayed more than 21 days in germany?
"as long as you were in either germany or singapore for 21 days before you board the plane, you do not need to serve a quarantine. but this is only for specific vtl flights, not all flights are the same."
lol nice travel
"steven, is the freshly brewed oktoberfest beer stronger in ur opinion? =d"
fresh beer always taste better! but i don't think it's that much stronger...i did not have enough to find out!
"steven chia thank you for your time to reply! drink it carefully x2, very friendly and concerned md~"
so the cameraman also travelled to germany??
no we hired a local crew since they would know the area better
when steven got shocked that the test only takes 35 mins.. and the guy at the counter just rolls his eyes at his over-the-top fake surprised reaction.. cos we all know that was just a way for the german guy to explain how they don't need a lab now cos of advanced tech.
"ha ha...don't tell everyone our secret! 🤣 but honestly when i first heard about it, i was truly surprised to know it could be done that fast!"
s$$$$$$ over lives
i found  this channel by accident and i  had to subscribe  after watching the documentaries with steven. they are really well made and he is an excellent host! i watch them all with much delight even if  i live in norway :-d
thank you! glad you found us all the way in norway!
steven chia thank you! wishing you a great weekend steven!
"germany vaccination 60%, malaysia vaccination rate also 60% already. when can allow vtl for malaysia? its been closed for 2 years and its really depressing. 82% vaccinated, 98% asymptomatic/mild symptom, yet 2021 is like another year of 2020 only. why we r still not able to move on?"
"agreed. a bit upset that vtl with germany when us is also over 60% plus in my county in san mateo, northern california its 80% vaccinated for people over 12. and most of us are waiting for a booster shot. so this high ""tax"" on vaccinated travelers seems like a way countries are recouping tourism dollars they lost for people desperate to travel for family reasons etc."
"jane muses singapore totally got no intention to open vtl with msia. msia only bother about business travel lane. i'm really depressed. living day by day, no purpose, no meaning. n they seem like want to lock singapore-jb border forever"
too troublesome to travel during the pandemic. i expect most airline companies to be bankrupt by the end
excellent informative video
"wow, 5 pcrs in total. the cheapest i could find on google in singapore costs $128. including gst, that's roughly rounded up to $140. multiplied by 5, that's $700. i don't think spending $700 just on testing is worth it."
so many loopholes in germany...
s$$$$$$$
"steve, you spent less than 21 days in germany, but still entitled for vtl and no quarantine upon back to singapore?"
thats no problem. you have to be in germany or singapore the last 21 days.
hope china and pakistan get on the vtl list
anyone know how i can get covid 19 vaccine certificate for my 13-year-old daughter?
"sinovac is chinese vaccine. its not recognised by mot western countries. so if you fly to australia, you will still need ot be vaccinated or be in isolation for 2 weeks and you will be treated as unvaccinated"
last time go airport earlier to submit tax refund cos of the queue in some airports....think next time got queue for pcr test when more people start to travel
a distress call from a yemeni youth to us president joe biden  i hope my message to joe biden i need help https://youtube.com/shorts/whduwqz3tng?feature=sharehttps://youtube.com/shorts/whduwqz3tng?feature=share
very informative program.  just what i'm looking for.  thank you.
hey what... you get into the newspaper for going to germany! it used to be that you had to go to the moon to get into the newspaper...
super duper
build the wall
only riches can afford to travel at this time
not for sinovac right - discrimination
much better than the stupid novita video lol
welcome back home!! i believedyouhad a good time in munich thanks for sharing a great video abt lvt n also seeing ppl in germany are well n fine.
"in germany we are holding our breath in to take the first step into the ""dark cold winter"". we hopes the best"
kevin khoo please prepare for arrival
"it is all about business man, you have to pay more and more that said ..... you pay for quarantine, you pay for medicine, you pay for extra transportation, you pay extra price tickets,  you pay extra taxes ...... etc . they want to return what they lost because of pandemic loses ."
"thanks for the info, i was wondering for sure. it's so expensive tho, wonder if there's a better way to streamline travel"
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
you then pathetic
this kind of comment is uncalled for.
s$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"showing people happily travelling, while jobs are being lost and fully vaccinated people are squeezing out rooms for self-isolation in hdb...thanks to our dear leeders"
stop whining
when singapore dont open borders and people dont get to travel more jobs will be lose!!! narrow minded people!!!
"why can people visit denmark where the covid cases are climbing, instead of indonesia where the cases are dropping?"
not intetested to travel now......❗❗ no thanks

5 covid test . such a awful sensation. no… i’ll wait until next year.
"hello,🙌 greetings from the royal family.. how are you doing today and how is the weather overthere with you.."
s$$$$$$$$$$
as steven grows older he is showing the true talent that he is... this goes to show that hard work pays and eventually your time to shine will come.
"yes, growing older indeed! thanks!"
"germany sounds more logical and clear with green, yellow, red status vs flip flop ong ye kung"
if i were him i would go to some other country possibly non europe right now.
"at least now they use some brain with the name, calling it travel lane, cos a lane is long, change from calling a bubble, wait keep popping."
my boi steven has them yellow eyes from overworking he needs a rest bros
emotional episode...brought me to tears 😆
i find it absolutely stupid that vaccinated singaporeans have to take 2 more tests on day 3 & 7! germany is not afraid of us going there but we are being treated like foreigners in our own country!
"😂 bro, we having 2k cases just yesterday, you want infected singaporereans from overseas to add to the hospitalised body count ar"
s$$$$$$
i found it mind boggling where certain countries only accepted certain types of vaccines. where who already listed out many of them for emergency used. like from the video it says sinovac is not accepted. 🥲
"traveling during the pandemic - you have a new tv show, steven!"
my favourite show and my favourite host.. thanks for always providing insides to many different topics..
it is so political driven that eu does not recognised who authorised vaccine unless it is made by western pharmaceutical companies. at the same time western countries are hoarding majority of their own vacacines without donating or selling to other part of the world! such selfish people as always!
"thanks for doing this cna, kudos to steve for taking one for the team and sharing your experience with us!"
"hello,🙌 greetings from the royal family.. how are you doing today and how is the weather overthere with you.🤗🕊️"
irresponsible video
"thanks for sharing your experiences and insights, steven and the cna team! my wife and i are traveling to germany next monday"
do share your experience and cost!
gouthamgs s will do!
have fun! hopefully the weather is good!
have fun and stay safe :)
"gouthamgs s here’s a video of our experience flying to germany. all-in our 6 day trip will cost singapore$10k. as this is our first flight in 2 years, we chose to indulge a bit (eg. flying business class). the costs can definitely be lower. https://youtu.be/elj22ic2-n0https://youtu.be/elj22ic2-n0"
hi there. i hope you will enjoy your stay here in germany. best wishes and stay healthy. i hope our regions can grow together in this harsh times
"great video content. good to let singaporeans be aware of what is available in terms of locations and money wise.  end state, for those who wants to travel, just take note that travelling now is not as cheap as it used to be. if cost is an issue, do explore saving up or exploring singapore. there are always choices available. question is; which choice are you looking at?"
lucky man for him while enjoying and get paid too .
meanwhile in the philippines the incompetent government is forcing people to wear facemask and faceshield....
cool its like a preview of future travelling
very well done and likeable guy
thank you! (it's me right? ha ha!)
good information
good thing the recovered are treated similarly as the vaccinated.
that is the best vaccine
anybody knows which travel insurance provider mentioned in the video and which steven has selected?
we had a special company policy since this was a work trip. best to check around as the policies keep changing.
looks like you're still on intermittent fasting!? 👌🏽👌🏽
definitely worth it if company paid
will be funny if he tested positive when departing from germany
this is so cool. also good product placement :)
jealous :(
"that’s way very expensive especially the pcr tests. i travelled to europe last month but didn’t go through so much hassles. paid only €49 for pcr test on my return flight. upon landing in dubai, the pcr is free for all ( tourists and residents) and result came in under 3.5 hours."
"doubt the vaccine id, testing and screening system will go away anytime soon, too much money to be made. countries relying on tourism (not talking about those in the eu or others) will have to look at alternative ways to grow their economies. the stagnation of travel and tourism might be a good thing overall."
playing with 🔥 fire for all travellers out there. you are selfish mofo.
really ‘ see no vac ‘ 😅
haha that is a good one.

wait why he didnt go to brunei first? lol
brunei is boring... 😁
"as a singaporean living in germany 🇩🇪, need to highlight about pcr test price in airport and in cities. results within 90mins cost €199,  within 6hrs cost €139, within 12hrs cost €99 and within 24hrs cost €69. steven used the 35mins one in airport when is most expensive €240 ."
oao! pricey!
oh no...muito caro!
"steven is sponsored by media corp (i guess) so why not? if for me, it's way too pricey to even make any sense at all."

great and fun jobyougot
thanks steve for sacrificing your september holidays so that we have quality content!
cheers 🍻 🍻 🍻 oktoberfest munich is amazing ❤
"wow. it's really expensive to travel during the pandemic, which cost $2k excluding accommodation and food. and to tolerate getting swabbed for so many times. guess probably it would be more worthwhile to travel after the pandemic but will have to wait a longgggg time."
"well, pre covid the flight alone was 2k. so same difference."
"i agree... price tag aside, i don't think i can stand being stuffed through my nose multiple times"
🍻
would be hilarious if they keep sending steven to new countries under the vtl scheme and this turns into a travel series
next stop: brunei - the most happening place in southeast asia.
"james lim whahahaha!!!! ya boy, who wouldnt want to go there?!!"
ha ha...sure! steve doesn't mind that!
haha it's a good idea. stevan would definetly like it.
a is for airborne
i'd look fwd to that. i hv always enjoyed his programs
great content idea for cna! it will be eye opening also for everyone to see how travel is like in those countries too.
"marianne morris right now, i think most of us wouldn’t mind travelling anywhere."
xxx xxx i is for in the sky
south korea next!
"next stop: seoul, korea"
amazing! so envious! hopefully new routes open up 😊
i hope so too!
"basically no idiots will stay in germany for the remaining time in germany..  many i know are planning to rent a car and drive down to places like netherland, italy, austria, luxembourg, paris and as far as the united kingdom."
you are so right. i even moved overseas bc quality of life has totally changed and you feel like a prisoner. i lived in munich my entire life but couldn’t stand all the rules. germans love regulations and rules not many of them are seeing this as a red flag
do this at your own peril. rest assured they will find out. the result will not be pretty .
there will be consequences!
"honestly, quite enjoy steven's videos. i'm also super jealous that he managed to get at least a sliver of a taste of what oktoberfest is like in munich... i've always wanted to go and gorge myself on roast pork and beer and be sick for like 3 days from too much food and waay too much booze.."
"as singaporean living in germany; rbg , the big octoberfest in münich is cancelled again this year. roast pork - not really my palate (too greasy n fattening) 😜🤪 grill chicken is a better option for this fest 🤓. enjoy 😀😀😀"
"wah steve,your in time for germany’s oktoberfest !  🍺🍺🍻🍻🍖🍗😋😋"
unfortunately it was cancelled...we were there the week before it was meant to start. but i still had my fair share of sausages and beer! ☺️
👍👍👍🥰well done cna! excellent work. love  to watch your programmes.
how much he spend from his overall trip all the test accommodation and etc
i hate the nasal swab ... i'd rather they extract blood!
"not worth it at all, wait for 6 more months."
🇸🇬 singapore seen from the international space station. source nasa johnson esrs https://youtu.be/z4rw2ocep3mhttps://youtu.be/z4rw2ocep3m
"so travelling overseas in this time and age is more for the wealthy who can spend bucketloads to pay for tests, potential quarantining when you come back etc. travelling is never going to be the same ever again. i don't understand why the airlines don't package the pcr tests and travel insurance as an additional charge over the ticket fare. they would anyways have to keep a conservative fare, and won't have a very high charge for tests and insurance too. getting tests done from clinics outside might actually be more expensive in a sense since they charge differently for faster results. for example- singapore to germany via singapore airlines, with 950$ for the airfare and another 300-400$ for tests and insurance. that seems way more affordable and straightforward, rather than liaising with multiple parties for tests, insurance and airfare. it feels like capitalizing on the name of the pandemic and infection to do more tests. what are the self-testing kits for then, and why can't they be used as proof of +ve/-ve tests? if they are not reliable and trustable for international travel, then have they just been released to increase public trust in the local system of testing?"
thats sq for you - bloodsuckers airline.
"chyna is no 1 that's why , got too much money"

"politicians, royalty and billionaires (and other uber rich) are travelling freely now. only the plebs have to go through 1001 procedures."
seletar airport
all in time for oktoberfest 🍻
"thank you so much for this helpful video! from the additional logistics of covid tastings, cost, and risk of infection, looks like 2022 will be another domestic travel year. and an opportunity to save $$$$!"
good for him.. his life is soooooo normal
for those few days it was! i'm sure singapore will get there too!
i thought pf said it is highly effective against infection? then why does spore need to conduct 3 pcr tests for returning singaporeans? isn't that contradicting their statements that the vaccine is 'highly effective'?
"it’s just ensuring that you’re definitely not infected? there’s no correlation between the two. 😂 if you’re coming back from a high-risk country, you don’t want to start an outbreak, because you may be the outlier who got infected, even if you got vaccinated."
"it protects against dying from infection, not getting or spreading the infection."
"renae davies it is related. didn't pfize said their vaccine is 95% effective against infection? go read their published marketing results. it is against infection and not hospitalization, get this clear."
"felicia felicia wrong! go read their initial published report. it is 95% against infection and not dying from infection. clinical trials are based on infection , not dying."
yeah...we just want to be extra sure here in singapore
some people just can't get over what was in the past. 😂😂😂 highly effective was the original strain. now is delta variant
"smallgouphakka it was not effective in the first place at 95%, that was false marketing. both alpha and delta variants have breakthrough cases."
"alex tong yes, 5% ineffective"
smallgouphakkamore like 5% effective.
alex tong where did your data come from ?

<b>great documentary but honestly its absolutely not worth it at all to travel during pandemic even with vtl cos its quite depressing to go through this protocols</b>
thanks for watching...guess it all depends on how badly you want to travel! the tests actually were not too bad.
"not for singaporeans finally have a chance to return singapore to visit our love one. my beloved singapore 🇸🇬, here i come !"
steven chia this vtl seems more suitable for urgent business trip and those visiting family in the motherland but with all this rather strict health checking i personally dont recommend anyone to travel there for leisure cos its constraining the mind to be free and at ease but still this documentary is on point in details and informative but apparently you look really worried most of the time but still its an excellent effort.
"cbcb simi, checking your health is degrading? if you don't get regular yearly health checkups then stage 4 cancer byebye. you don't seem like someone with a long lifespan other ppl would want."
"steven chia hi steven, may i know which insurance company you used for the travel insurance?"
"oh god, so many swab tests to do in singapore if you were to leave and come back to singapore. in this video, they say that germany has saliva test. how effective is this saliva test?"
i think is definitely not as effective as a proper pcr nose and throat swab test. that's why even the kits we buy ourselves is the swab type.
it is a full pcr test.
"wong francis but honestly, based on the video based on his trip to germany and back to singapore, he had to take five pcr swab tests in total.  to me, five swab tests, for a single trip to ensure a safe journey to all singaporeans going to vtl countries, is a lot for me to handle. my nose would be very assaulted and insulted at the same time although i have done it once before and tested negative luckily...😧"
"nigel morais with the new heightened alert due to recent surge, it only makes sense for singaporean to visit germany not the other way round. with dining only for 2, it's no fun at all, and impossible if for a family of 3 or above. plus singapore is small and it's hard to spend more than 5 days. with such a long flight,  many hurdles to jump, it really makes no sense."
"so technically at the moment, travelling is for people that have buckets of money to spend. test here test there....  a price to pay ...for now...."
"unless you are a diplomat, celebrity, sports star, actor, minister etc. you are supposed to spend the rest of your life inside home making zoom calls with your boss and friends, and watching youtube videos to satisfy travel urge. get used to it."
forever unless you comply and get vaxxed
"out of all the place he went to germany the country i left for good, exactly for those reason."
better visit ubin
"i think this is a bonus that cna gave you and you are able to drink on the job. 😁 after seeing their beer 🍺, our look like it's kids size.😅"
"believe it or not, it was non-alcoholic beer! we only drank the real stuff after filming 😆"
steven chia cheating la
that is what is called a normal beer. ours come in test tubes 🤭
steven chia ya sure 😉
"steven chia after working holidays, maybe can be vegan for a week. see how challeng is it in singapore. 😁"
steven chia 😂 i guess still can't get drunk on the job
"woah, the cost and test itself is quite high, just like the thailand holiday scheme. unless you really need to be reunited with your closed ones overseas. the whole process can be anxiety-inducing & nerve wrecking. especially when waiting for the results."
"there are just too many false positives in the tests. moreover, if the test is conducted by the authorities themselves when they supply the kit, or observe the kit out of your own sight, they can easily fudge the result when they just do not like you, because of your skin colour, or if you carry the 'wrong' passport etc. in other words, they will take your money to conduct the test, but they have full control of the results, and the outcomes to use it against you. they can send people to compulsory 14 days quarantine (where the quarantine is paid for by the traveller himself) based on a semi-accurate test conducted by themselves, in order to help the hotels that have been converted to quarantine facilities (such as conrad singapore)"
$600 just in pcr tests? i rather get covid.
😂😂
"trinity after treatment for covid, you are slapped with a bill of $6k..."
"hahaha, travel now is ridiculously expensive af"
"kal well not necessarily. last week, i went to spain, my vaccine card was enough to get into schengen so i didn't need to do the pcr test(although it's free here in the states) before heading there. when i had to fly back to the us, i had to do a simple antigen test which was 35 euros. instead of spending 600 euros, i only spent 35 euros during my week in europe."
"henry song i think it differs from each country. looking at singapore, coming back is ridiculously expensive."
"kal we have vaccines. i don't get why singapore has to be anal about covid. people don't die from covid if they are healthy, i know for fact singaporeans have a healthy lifestyle."
"henry song i think you can tell by performance. us has one of the biggest death/million population. americans arent the type to just be ok with restrictions, asians like to just follow rules set by higher ups"
not worth it. stay home.
"this shows that technology is a double-edged sword, better weapons=more devastating kills, better transportation=easy spreading of virus, better computer=now everyone has to fill in thousand of online forms. in conclusion, technology is the most convenient and most inconvenient human invention ever."
yes but i think the good outweighs the bad
thank you for this episode! i needed this first hand info. planning my europe vacay. 👍🏻
i hope you will enjoy your stay. best wishes from germany
high quality content.  keep it up.
"wow, hitler revisits germany, now"
super love steve chia and his series! keep it coming!
thank you!

very useful information. 👍👍
the whole of singapore is envious right now
u mean envious on the number of cases reporting as it surge up.
why ?? as if you will never ever travel again ❓❓❓ please ..lah ❗❗❗ be patient till everything is fine --- then you travel as much as you liked 👍😀👍
wow
not worth it at this point in time!
"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23covid_vaccine#covid_vaccine has the structure of hiv same as covid 19 virus to deceive your immunity system to create t-cell perish together with the virus(just like overclocking immunity system temporarily), but unable to deceive the new covid 19 variant, the virus will permanently stay at human body's t-cell then cause it malfunction to duplicate, destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated.  covid vaccine is a resistance of covid virus to create new variant, it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected, at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like 'murphy', ""against the virus not eliminated"", currently the opportunity to the death of having vaccine injection is less due to it's ineffectiveness since vaccine maker has been modified it to be safe.  vaccine manufacturer can be sued now after fda fully approve those vaccine, this is great liberty status evolution. a lot of people death or having long term adverse reaction in vaccination before, and the government still keep hiding the truth.,.;'-5"
this is a very insightful and informative documentary as i’m planning to go to germany this december for holidays.
advance welcome to deutschland 🇩🇪
"that is too much work (and too many tests) for a single trip.  maybe this crisis is giving us a lesson, to slow down and enjoy the solitude or the company of our immediate family, relatives, friends and the simple, local destinations."

the ones who feel that they need to go china 🤭
people like me who has an allergic reaction to pfizer vaccine and can’t get that. so many people here are so clueless...
"catherine lim but what about astraz, j&j or even sputnik? how many people have probable allergies against all of those?  i think it's really more about what's recognized and available."
"my friend who needs to go to china to stay w bf? 😂 simisai sinovac still effective, got inject better than unvaxxed as most doctors will tell you. 20% in singapore still unvaxxed leh, you go drag them, leave my friend alone"
"who han that depends on individual country if they want to “recognized” a vaccine. this programmer shows that sinovac is not recognized in germany. astraz is still the most widely recognized vaccine, followed by pfizer, modena...etc"
i do love to travel too..soon on god's will
"not worth it. too expensive, too much red tape."
"yes, the total costs maybe even higher if you failed the pdt prior to return to singapore. quarantine costs in germany may not 100% covered by travel insurance."
happiest when i saw mask off!!
love your documentaries :d i remember him from the boba episode. so hilarious xd
thank you for this very helpful video! 👍
can we get steve infected with covid? preferably with the delta variant so he can share with us his experience with home recovery? it would greatly help singaporeans with their anxiety with home recovery as we move towards endemic living.

"germany good choice, even if there wasn’t much of a choice."
"i lived  there my whole life munich was the city i was born in and it’s utterly sad  how the city has changed.  i moved overseas a few months ago because i didn’t want to compromise my life for all these stupid rules and my friends back there are so miserable..i tried tonwaren them but they say it’s getting worse and worse so yeah germany was a cool place to live in but not anymore ,"
ms. smith my grandmother was german from hannover so i spent most of my early life to late 20s visiting. i want to go back some time. it’s been eight years since i was last there at my granny’s funeral. she was the best and i was the favourite lol.
"ms. smith it probably would help some of us empathize if you'd specify your reasons to think germany has changed for the way worse. i gathered evidence from another comment of yours that asides from maybe covid-restrictions [where germany really is rater reasonable] it has to do with our open door (maybe especially ""refugee welcome"") policy that's so heavily criticized by the emerged, yet again tumbling afd party. or is it just a general thing with munich zoning and lessening affordability for common folks? what exactly was there to warn your friends about and where (roughly) do you reside now usually to consider the issues avoided not outweighed by any drawbacks?  grüße, ein deutscher aus bayerns westlichem nachbar(bundes)land (nahe hessen und rp)."

"in addition to the data of vaccinated who succumbed to covid-19, another data of interest would be how many, if any, vaccinated persons have re-contracted covid and gotten seriously ill. also, if fully vaccinated status expires a year and 2 weeks after the second shot, how about those who have taken booster shots?"

vincecarlo you know what is “sandboxes” by the way ?😜
sky  a place where 1 can make sand castles 🤭🤭
"vincecarlo 😂😂😂 the 2 on trial sandboxes now are separate from the main land of thailand and vietnam . majority of the islanders had been vaccinated. true , people from all over the world can enter these islands but only vaccinated people can enter . therefore you need to measure the recovery index of these islands separate from the main countries they belonged to . if the vision is to be living with endemic now, then what’s the concern with establishing vtl with these sandboxes where the only potential risk of contacts are with vaccinated travellers from other countries ?"
sky  singapore can enter thailand quarantine free just pcr on arrival n 1 night stay to wait for pcr result  returning to singapore is a biatch although they are much higher than many western countries  utter bollocks
vincecarlo so naive about this rubbbbish list.
<b>great news so next we need vtl to johore and batam for a quick weekend getaway so please make this happen</b>
ain't gonna happen
vincecarlo why ?
why not thailand and indonesia
indonesia already in
coshinc means batam open liao?😂

"its good news for those who want to travel, even for me but im afraid it will be short-lived. cases in singapore is still in thousands and they act as if its less than 10. remember the ktv spike, they place us in phase 2 but now cases is thousands they open borders for travel??"
"that is the right thing, bo bian. if wait until 0 pax, then 2050 also not fixed."
meowth no need until 0. even less than 10 good enough besides no need to wait 2050 then cases go to 0. previously singapore also got 0 cases lol
"inker man well, then we would expect to be in lockdown forever, this virus will not be going away."

inker man how would you go about doing it? how would you suggest to reduce the number? without lockdown.
"meowth well you are digressing too far. lets start with having the right mindset 1st. i knowyouguys desperately want to travel, so do i but lets address the elephant in the room 1st which is infected cases is in thousands but vtl is in talks and going to happen. doesnt makes sense right? if people cant see that dont start talking about solutions when the problem itself they cant identify"
vincecarlo im surprised mlysia is lower than singapore. im expecting them to do worse since they lack good system
inker man  m'sia use a mix of vaccines  ranking of countries by recovery index #1 uae - manufactures sinopharm vaccine  #2 china - sinovax / sinopharm  #32 singapore #34 sweden #61 germany http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23109#109 netherlands  http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23120#120 finland http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23131#131 uk http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23146#146 us of a source - gci #1 & 2 use sinopharm/sinovax just look at those western countries ranking and the vaccine they use. mrna high efficacy  ? hah bloody joke
vincecarlo mrna vaccines doesnt work. look at singapore we know already. sinopharm according to the rankings by gci have good recovery rate
"i assume the gov assess this base on risk. they probably think the probability for vaccinated getting infected or die from it are lower compare to unvaccinated. and considering the total vaccinated citizens in singapore so far, it's tolerable enough for them to open up without killing the majority people. but unfortunate for the minority who could have underlying medical issue or in a poorer health condition. top management will want the whole singapore to survive without caring too much on smaller problems if the bigger one can be resolved. just my assumption."
"ah yi i agree with you, though i think the only flaws is that govt place too much trust on the efficiency of the vaccines which undermines the reason to take calculated risk for vtl. but this is another topic to discuss, i dont want to digress too far. its a mixed feelings for this vtl, relief and concern"
inker man  yep both #1 & #2 are all inactivated vaccine so much for 🐃💩 efficacy of mrna jabs
"inker man well, actually, thousand of cases a day isn't a lot. unfortunately. take flu for example, the current symptoms for 90% of the folks is similar to that of flu. flu has also killed and hospitalized many folks. therefore, based on your theory, thousands of cases is not very significant. - unfortunately. 2ndly, no i am not desperate to travel. let say you are right, then how should the case be controlled? without vtl."
"meowth not a lot is based on your perspective only. compared to a small nation like singapore, thousands is a lot. you cant compare flu to covid in this case, flu is not a pandemic that closed down borders and shook the world. you asking me about solutions when singapore overpaid ministers cant solve them? 🤣 what i can give is suggestions and my point-of-view. 1stly the vaccines needs to be right 1st. our vaccines is questionable and controversial thus explains why singapore is in this predicament right now. get the vaccines right then everything will fall into place and eventually it will be really safe to open borders for everyone"
"inker man spanish flu was a pandemic. unfortunately, 3000/6000000 is a very small %, based on population size and not ‘small’. if i say 3000 eat chicken rice a day out of 6 mil, thats very little right? i just want to hear opinion actually because many has claimed to want this fix but not providing a suggestion, so just curious how each would manage this. would be better to have solution proposal and a vague goal.  as for vaccine, seems like its working to me, 98% mild symptoms, thats very effective."
"meowth spanish flu was a pandemic, covid is a pandemic. so whats your point? again 3000/6000000 ""small"" is based on your own perspective besides, covid is not just in singapore only, its worldwide unlike spanish flu. as for vaccines, do try different sources to know the credibility of the vaccines. dont just rely on mainstream media. doctors, scientists who has no link to govt or media have better credibility to say about vaccines than those who are afraid to lose their jobs. try dr peter mccullough for instance"
meowth  slight problem with your argument. you don't die by eating chicken rice.
"meowth  this is how it should be done. we had our lockdown. we could have done mass pcr testing but we did not. if we could move 2.5 million out of their homes, even the wheelchair bound to vote in the ge within a day, we can do mass pcr test in 3 days. the reason they did not do it is because they're afraid of the numbers. next, we control the spread. we have no common land borders with any country except 2 roads leading to jb. we have 1 international airport and a few seaports of entry. we are only 700 square kilometres. all we needed to do was control imported cases. it is a lie that lockdowns need to last forever. wuhan locked down for 2 months and has close to zero cases a day now. another city of 11 million lockdowned a week after mass testing and is now covid free. they just manage the clusters as they arise. remember they had the virus largely under control even before the first vaccine was developed. vaccination is just a secondary protection for them. and why are we still talking about cases in the dormitories after 20 months. hiring has practically stopped. their movements have been curbed. isn't it just a distraction from the mmtf incompetence? it's been all lies and deception. the stone was already cast when temasek bought a stake in pfizer."
"jp phua interesting. so you would go for 0 covid approach? but if all other countries not doing it, are we going to not let people in/out quarantine forever?  bcos all you need is 1 case to create 2, 2 to 4 and so on. whereas pcr, i thought the same, but that requires more than paper and manpower. you need the equipment and trained swabbers and testers. what if 1 test is not accurate and how many rounds are required? possible but not as easy."
jp phua sure but neither is 3000 people dying from covid a day. but fact is 3000/6mil is low.
"meowth  3000 cases a day. pm lee says it might last 6 months. that's 547,500 cases. 10% of our populations. at 17 deaths a day, that's 3000 deaths. and that's okay with you?"
"meowth  do you need to follow other countries just because they are stupid? art is less accurate than pcr. why then are we wasting our time and resources. i do my own art and i'm not trained. the swabbing procedure is the same for pcr, isn't it. the virus has been around for 20 months. it's not that every country is rushing to buy pcr testing equipment. if china can do it in a few days for a city of 11 million, we should be able to do it. no?"
meowth  have you heard of 17 people dying a day because they ate chicken rice? checkmate.
jp phua if its 3000 more deaths compared to non covid. then its no good.
"jp phua we should avoid characterising people here. i do not agree with what gov is doing too. china has resources.. we dont, where are you going to house 6 million samples? if we do it for 5 days that is 30 mil samples.  art is very easy test. swabbing is easy. its the isolation of rna strand virus that requires centrifuge and testing that is complicated. for example, i would ask if you know how to separate the ink colours based on this solubility using chromatography. would you be able to do? i think you but not everyone can. some find it hard to do art. let me ask you a very simple question. if we isolate ourselves. we lose investors, company leaves, singaporean lose jobs, 30% unemployment. cannot afford food. how?"
"jp phua the point is not chicken rice, it is the statistic.  statistically you have 0.01% chance of winning 4d, that's low right? 3000/6mil is 0.05%. that is still very low.  regardless. you may still think its very high. that's your tolerance."
meowth  you are the one who brought up chicken rice. now you say it's not the point. can you make up your mind? you talk about statistics yet you don't know simple math. do you know what is 3000 per day? you multiply than by 100 days and what you get? 300000. you divide 300000 by 6000000 and what you get? 5%. 5% is high for me. but not high enough for you?
"meowth  don't believe all the fear mongering by the pap. we attracted 17.2 billion dollars in foreign direct investments in 2020, a 12 year high. companies are not moving out en mass. and we have tons of money in our national reserves which has only been tapped into once. the sky is not going to fall. don't worry."
meowth  it's been 20 months now and i have not had a pcr test done on me. have you? the fact is they're not even interested in the numbers. you don't have to make excuses for them. all they're interested in is pushing the pfizer vaccine even though 94% of all eligible are vaccinated. still cannot connect the dots?
"jp phua well, at this point you are just trying to win an argument. i am just point out a fact. chicken rice was just used as an example to illustrate % point. 5% is very little. 5% won't even get you herd immunity."
"jp phua ok, so basically we should be like norway where we just use all the resources we have until it runs out before we figure out what to do? bcos looks like you are looking at permanent isolation."
"jp phua i have had 3. thing is, i am not trying to find fault with a singular point of view. we can have many suggestions but how to go about doing it is totally another story. i can say, lock down for 1 mth, let the virus die off. will it? live in isolation for a month. no it won't. that's just how it is.  doesn't matter moderna, pfizer. we should open up to &gt; 10 pax a now. faster the spread, faster back to normalcy. no need for tt, no need for all other stuff."
"inker man you said flu is not pandemic. 0.05% is small... go to any statistic calculation and 0.05% is not even considered. well within error zone. so believing in a 2-3 outspoken source is more credible. got it. like kim jong un. or should we look at scientific papers with high citation. anyway in terms of vaccine, its  your own call right?"
"meowth  you flip roti prata as well as the mmtf. 0.05% was low. now 5%, 100 times more, is also low. now you flip to herd immunity? you're as good as the mmtf in trying to confuse others. lucky for us we're too smart for you"
"meowth jp phua is right on the flip roti prata part 🤣. if you are cynical and want to force your confusion to others, do it only on yourself. youre a laughing stock now and we know it"
meowth again the numbers however small is based on your own perspective. it seems you are the only one who claimed that 3000/6000000 is small so far when everyone else is saying that it is big
"meowth in terms of vaccines, its not about whether its my call or not. im advising you to be open-minded and not have a narrow vision when it comes to information. you seems to be one of those people who only read mainstream media. try not to get confused"
meowth  did i say i want permanent isolation? did i mention norway? stop putting words in my mouth. all i want is for the mmtf to stop their deception and lies. opening up to foreigners without quarantine when we're peaking in just stupid. why spend unnecessary resources to attract them when they're not coming because of their travel advisory blacklisting us?
"meowth  you've had 3 pcr tests. i have none. you've made my point that they're doing it haphazardly with no intention of telling the public the truth. just smoke and mirrors as usual. lucky we're smart, unlike you."
meowth  yes i'm here to win an argument. and you're here to deceive with your 0.05% which everybody knows means nothing. you're the only fool that uses infections per day vs population as a measurement on how a country performs. how stupid can one get?
"jp phua you are missing my point. not important. there is actually no way to keep the case low to achieve reopening. you can have low case but once you open up, it's going to rise again."
"inker man actually, i am open to the vaccine being unsafe, unreliable. i am just reading data and using microbiology scientific evident to evaluate the conclusion. whereas you are the one who are not willing to accept. and i am narrow minded? :)"
"inker man go out for a walk see the crowd. if majority thinks it's high, they won't be out and about so much. don't just stay inside the 4 walls."
"inker man actually, i agree with the prata flipping part. actually, if you read back on the chat. i just wanted to point out a few facts and looking for suggestions. i did not characterized anyone."
"jp phua try to read up on how herd immunity work! 0.05% is low infection. 100 times more is still not high enough for herd immunity. i know you're smart, you will understand how microbiology works!"
inker man  i think we ignore him and just let him make a fool of himself. what do you think? no point talking to a shameless fool.
"meowth previously you've said you have no issue with the vaccine now youre saying you are open with the vaccine being unsafe. just like jp phua said, you flip prata a lot🤣"
meowth what microbiology scientific evidence?? you mean the one from fauci and those who are linked with the profit from vaccines? 🤣 come on! you expect me to believe it is credible
inker man i think vaccine works. was open to vaccine being unsafe. dont think its unsafe.
"meowth majority dont care anymore so much because people like you flip prata soo much and change the rules too often, they are outside with the crowd because they want to live normal life again and some like you believe blindly that the vaccines will make you invincible against the virus"
"jp phua just want to point out, 0.05% infection a day is low. 0.5% infection a day is high. overall of 0.5% infection is too low for herd immunity. even at 10% also not enuf."
meowth dont forget to agreeing on you yourself doing the flipping prata too
"inker man nono. go to sciencedirect, nature, reliable journals."
"meowth if they are reliable, why you are soo lost?"
"hooray, good for singapore!👍"
yes
a great decision by our mtf. they handle it well. step by step we are getting there
"how can they extend vtl and sacrifice our health, well being and lives for money. it is a selfish act, undemocratic and cruel.😡😡😡"

how about citizens who return for less than a week?  does it mean such individuals cannot come home?
why must return for less than 1 week ?

covid is now endemic. is lhl prime ministership also endemic?
covid  are smarter than what experts think  these days.  i am worried.
"the vaccine business is making big bucks. i bet after the 2nd or third booster shots, our government will start to charge us for subsequent booster shots. a new revenue of income from its own citizens"
"requiring booster shots this early indicates how accurate the ""efficacy rate"" is of these mrna experiments. who is artificially liking these videos? the previous videos had higher downvote to upvote ratio, this is not organic."
"they can open up  germany to come here direct . i just curious , why can't they let  singaporeans not vaccinated  to dine in restaurant.  germany to singapore  average flying time is 12 to 13 hours .even more high risk in the  airplane.  why can't let  unvaccinated  people dine in restaurant for 2. unvaccinated people also healthy right ?"

in my kampong cebu philippines 5 persons died after vaccine.
"are we closing in on the search for the correlate of protection, especially for the immunocompromised patients, before we can recommend the third booster shot? and forward that, a antibody test for the unvaccinated people. we are probably too focused on the narrative 'the vaccinated people are protecting the unvaccinated people', that is not entirely based on science."
the vaccinated ones are the ones with variants.
let's count down how long it will take for singapore to go back to phase 2 heightened alert.
so many cases cannot trace still want to open
"lol that doctor like staged / script talking , listen liao also sian"
only fools like pap ministers believe vaccines can keep the virus at bay...
it’s called self hallucinations.
want to play hero

interesting.... how wil ica know if any eu passport has been in germany 21days before depart to singapore?...... mtf mil$ math!
ifyoudon't think vaccinated will get covid n suffer from its effects...delta n future unknown mutated variants r highly contagious...i can foresee future cases...i had thought kpi of all citizens was to work towards zero or one covid case..so we can live safely... i was wrong..this is playing with 🔥covid...at least give us free test kits frequently to test ourselves...i don't wish to spread to others...
"the people here mainly  lives in flats and in such close proximity like pigeon holes .they also share lifts . if they allow active covid cases to stay home during this stage, then there’s chance of spread because of the proximity, & also through formites ."
"actually, with the emergence of the delta variant in other countries that are heavily vaccinated, shouldn't they slow down the reopening?"
"the govt is prep us to live with covid, as it's nearly impossible to eradicate covid in near future. so the first few batches of people travelling will serve as ""guinea pigs"" and restrictions will continue to be revised every now and then."
wait for lambda....
its like playing russian roulette. never know when the gun will fire!
so are you sure delta is not there in germany and brunei? how it differentiate with an indian fully vaccinated traveller? germany population: approx. 85 million as per todays virus count: 9000 people infected today alone( delta already detected) india population: 1.5 billion  today virus count : 30k plus please tell me who is at higher side?
than please stay home and dont come
su su noone knows why border can not be open for vaccinated people. they do not have anything to argue.
india might be faking their data. there could be much more deltas in india which they never declared. i think it’ll be safer not to let anyone who have been india or any south asia countries in for the past 31 days.
"andy sim who on the earth not faking the data? do you know every damn country in the world where virus created havoc has atleast 1 variant.  however, in usa, why there is no variant? do you know 1 delta variant is enough to spoil the entire country? if delta is everywhere, why only india? in india, now business is as usual.  india is a open society unlike china. media is powerful. nothing govt can hide. not much covid patients r in hospitals."
"in my opinion, singapore government should  require all travellers from overseas including hong kong and macau, to also have a negative pcr pre-departure test result 72 hours before getting on a flight to singapore, in addition to on-arrival test.  if not, some travellers could be covid-19 positive, and actively spreading the virus to others on the plane and in our airport. thus endangering the life of fellow passengers, staff and others."
"hope ministers see your comment. we don't mind people travelling outta singapore, we  r more worried about the incoming ones."
yes
"jas g they do not need to see this comments,,, they do not take bus n mrt, , seldom they makan at coffeeshop too"
"a year ago we hoping for a vaccine to end this pandemic, now after vaccines, come up with delta variant...so what variant next? echo variant?, foxtrot variant? golf variant? hotel variant up until zulu variant? then booster? booster after booster after booster after booster? end up after so many injection then got so many lobang on your arm and covid still smiling and say yeeeaaah baby  im here to stay...bring it on..but still im praying that all will get better....i miss my family"

"it is part of their plan. you have been lied to from the beginning.  this is a plandemic. watch out for all the green initiatives they are passing. they are transitioning the economy. e-commerce, etc it is tied to this event 201. world economic forum has plans for a new economy. and they want control.  all your carbon taxes is a means to siphon more money off the man on the street. companies pay a lot of taxes, so wages will be depressed and goods will be more expensive as a result of these ""green"" taxes."
"they either ignore our comments or act blurrrr while getting fatter and fattter, hoa!  no wonder kamala harris wants to shake their hands."
"can i had peace in my mind here. if i renounce my senior citizen ,willyoureturn my cpf money. since , singapore gov is so corrupted here.only take n bullied common people ,refute n return their hard earned money contribute in their cpf account. till want senior citizen work 70 age , despite people are unable to work permanently anymore,in medical ground."
pls go to malaysia and thailand or indonesia to stay and tell me if singapore government is corrupted. i welcome you to retire there so that the government could subsidize my medical care better

oh ceca start already
there is one unknown variable:  you never know how the virus mutate to counter strike your effort. it is all about playing luck and danger lurking.
we are about to welcome more variants
i wonder how many ppl who travel to singapore in a year that originated from brunei and 🇩🇪
india should be at category 1  ... it's an injustice
than dont come. thks
importing covic again....
oh yah this  time round from hongkong macau so now you know where it comes from no need blame india
heightened alert  coming soon
why why why for long term pass holders need to take the travel pass approval first and not others? how does it even make a difference? are ltp holders not humans?  in singapore go to germany come back ltp holders need approval but not others?  how does it even act as safeguard measure when for both of them the source and destinations are the same?  really don't understand why they treat ltp holders like this?
yah mr healthy no need mask again......
"st, jus my 2cents opinion. the word doctor should be pronounced in full. if the news presenter read it in short it sounds like dog(doc)."
depends on the doctor . some doctors should  be called 🐕tors   😁
no need la...a doctor is a doc..widely accepted term. a do(g) can never be a do(c). its only singaporean pronunciation. its liddat lor.
"dear ministers, tbh i am very skeptical about the vaccines. please be honest with us the numbers and details of people who are affected adversely by the vaccines, those that you have issue compensation, and is that all. now you want our children to be vaccinated as well? please review ur figures.."
"was the 2 compensation cases paid  in ca$h or medisave credit  🤔 they survived covid , right ?"
"pay out ~1/4 million is already admittance to vaccine cause of severe illness  "" safe & effective "" yeah rite"
if they want to tell the truth they will use absolute risk reduction of 0.7% efficacy. absolute risk reduction is used for chicken pox and other vaccines.
"if they've the slightest display of honesty, no singaporean would ever be involved in such an experimental trial at national level without inform consent."
comparing singapore housing design hdb with the country goodo prof  mention self isolation😂
the 3nd vacciness  no thanks i won't take any more  too sttrong i💪💪 enough thankfully  st
hmm...still lots childish and ignorant posts!
hope our health care resources can take the next hit.
"our medical facilities are advanced and adequate to cater to local population, but with the re-opening starting next month, not sure how severe the surge in covid will be with the influx of tourists."
lol. using big words like heterologous and homologous. just say mixed vaccine and singular vaccine.  using flamboyant words show you are not close to the commoners and wants to sync with them. still dare to says they are with the people.
"if you cannot convince, confuse 😂"
"they are with the people only when things are rosy . when the weather  becomes stormy , , they will disappear before you can even  blink 😜"
well said.  路遙遠知馬力，日久見人心。
any issue opening the sin malaysia (jb) border..?
"malaysia’s covid situation is really bod, the 4 countries which we have opened up to have their situation under control"
jb is at its peak... just stay home please
the virus with be very happy
straits times - can any of your reporter - ask question to task force about the travel opening with india ?
never to open
don't open
"nope, no thanks stay where you are india has perfected the art of covid-19 mutations; delta variant has spread to 130 countries . &gt;433k deaths; but in reality probably &gt;1m due to under counting.  &gt;32.3m infections"
"please stay home, we already hv too many cases"
may lost job
allow air travel from many countries but social gathering or dine in at f&b still pegged at 5 pax max. i am lost.
"economy their priority, not residents."
we too 🤔
"h kitty  you're absolutely right , dearie that's why they are now known as profit above people . stay safe  😷"
"ya, allowing air travel is really risky. we kept our cases low within our population, and the spike was usually due to influx of tourists. even with dining of limited pax, dont think gonna help."
muppet logic
pls pls open borders to riau. esp batam bintan. singapore should donate vaccine to batam and bintan. tks.
what about opening of indian border?
no please. we are still in the mess open borders with india created.
"nope, no thanks stay where you are india has perfected the art of covid-19 mutations; delta variant has spread to 130 countries . &gt;433k deaths; but in reality probably &gt;1m due to under counting.  &gt;32.3m infections"
just stay home thanks! we already have enough cases here
cw8 comment rubbish
vincecarlo all the virus came from china wuhan just a reminder
bell198000 china is a heaven for you why dont you go there you can help them with gheir flood bussiness
su su yes you are right wuhan virus have not been  cleared
rubarani v your comment is rubbish.
rubarani v yes. but knowing the virus existed and gathering in the thousands is plain irresponsible. what's even worse is knowing you have a mysterious variant and still have the audacity to travel out of the country and spread the misery everywhere.
"since our parents' generations, we have been trusting the government's judgments and following their leadership. we are glad that we have made the right choice as the quality of our lives have been improving continuously. 💖 🇸🇬"
there is two booksyouneed to read
animal farm
who moved my cheese?
err......
ya lor. we have a former transport minister overnight become health expert..so lucky to have genius in govt.
"quality of our lives are either maintained or still continue to get better in 2020 and 2021. hence, all of us have donated the $600 received in april 2020 to charities. we must have done something right! 💖 🇸🇬"
"almost all home grown singaporean have the same starting point. some ended with very low pay could be due to laziness too. ""you are what you are today because of the choices you made in the past - jim rohn""."
moh was run by electrical engineer n now biz/econs major. wow
"des chan  and 2 movies to watch. matrix and truman show. living in a bubble. plug into the internet and be oblivious to what is really going on. manipulation of perception and manipulation of world affairs.  plugged into ""the system""."
"time to broaden knowledge: goh chok tong, major in economic, not marine engineering, turned nol into profit. that’s why he was invited to join pap and subsequently became pm. lou gerstner, was ceo of nabisco (biscuit co.), has no track record in managing computer companies, was invited to join ibm & save the falling computer giant in the 90’s."
tricia cool - exited🙂   hvyouread the books i recommended?
"the government is still proven to be reliable. unlike wp, have a ""track record"" of misappropriation of funds."
also the government is keeping pace with the ever changing world. that's why singapore don't focus on singular economy.
tricia cool - exited 🙂 your stuck
des chan you are blinded!
"tricia cool - exited   amk tc is pm's ward, go read up on the corruption case n who got jailed get yourself better educated instead of spewing 💩💩💩"
"also blind? !  amk tc case, justice has been served. party involved was not a mp. amount involved was not more than $200k. comparing to wp's case, 3 exmp/mps involved, amount &gt; $33m."
corruption right under pm's nose says so much where singapore is heading. 👍👏👏👏👏
only resemblance 4g has with 1st gen pap is they are humans.  any resemblance stops there. way way way over paid; fumbling n bumbling.  where is accountability  ?
switch focus again?!  never worked as or worked for top managements before? thought that their only work is making public appearance? what is the basis of claiming overpaid?
"palm trees well said indeed. remember all those pp top honchos promise of smart nation, digitalisation get our seniors to hook onto their bandwagon ? that's their final dream. enslavement in progress."
des chan you always full of yourself comment commrnt comment and comment full of rubbish
des chan dont ask people to read your recommended books i advise you to read history of singapore.youare racist i have been reading your comments.
vincecarlo pm cant be responsibly  for everyone greed
rubarani v rubbish?  🙂  my comment is not for you ! pls dont read my comment
rubarani v racist?  which word n sentence makeyouthink so? list it out!
rubarani v reading singapore history is reserved for non true singaporeans.  doyouknow why?
tricia cool - exited blind?  definitely not me
rubarani v pm is overall in charge.  he is responsible
"there are people who thought that they have read some books, they are wiser. unfortunately, they failed to see that our government has put the gist of it to practice. they also intentionally turn a blind eye to what the government has been put in to action to keep the country going. we, on the other hand, keep an open mind to assess these actions and make the best out  of them."
tricia cool - exited open eyes?    🤣😂🤣😂  i guessyoudont even know yr eyes r not opened
"des chan apparently, you didn't open your eyes! 😔 anyway, open eyes or open minds, we know we are doing right & are doing well. hence, we have never fear of competitions and regularly enhance the plans for our futures. if you want to continue to be sour grapes, go ahead! will not respond to any further post on this!"
tricia cool - exited hvyouread the books i recommended
"give us a break with the so called ""expert"".  there are reported cases of fully vaccinated dying of covid 19 in other countries.  even in singapore there is one case. he is irresponsible to say vaccinated are not at risk.   as i hear him talk,  it has become jokes!!!"
they knew vacines is not foolproof yet they go into full opening.   thats irresponsible.
its called false security.
"no problem what ? - if 3rd wave safeguatds are already in place : ) 1. achieve 100% vaccination asap 2. impose c b 3 immediately 3. convert hospital wards into icu     wards ; and 4. import more dogters from      philippines & india with fake      credentials , incentivising and      confering  them with instant pr      staus & priveleges  🙂 pap 🤡🎪🤡 emergency  covid  action plan"
brendan koh 😂🤣😂🤣
konchok trinley yup false security
"they're very sly and cunning. their reply is always it's never ""foolproof"". and if you try to reason with them or have a sincere dialogue, they would invariably try to muddle up and ""proof that you're fool""."
when novovax? soon i hope as option for booster.
whether can novovax can approved for children use? i'm so worry for our children now.
"wong kok kiong once who approves can get it possibly via private hospitals. timeline maybe who will approve it 6 to 8 weeks from now, maybe less. us cdc approval maybe next year jan/feb 2022."
"novovax if effective, china wont have a bug out break over more than 10 ciities, which almost 95% of its people are vaccinated with 2 jab months ago...."
"walter wong ??? novavax is a us corp, that a protein sub unit vaccine, not inactivated/killed virus vaccine. as of now nobody has approve it for use under eua. its under serious consideration for approval by the us cdc, its very likely to be approved but very late 2021 or very early 2022. the corporate has not seek any regulatory approval from china prc for use there. so don't know what your talking about."
"in short, they dont know what is the 3rd vaccines.  its trial and error, effectively those taking the booster shot r lab guinea pigs."
once jabbed no stopping!!
"god's amazing grace yup, endless.  pharmaceutical companies revenue is guaranteed"
des chan  exactly
"god's amazing grace  yes , we will  be transformed into vaccine junkies  🧟‍♂️ 🧟‍♀️ sooner or later ."
des chan  对了！根本就是！this is a plandemic. it is about making money. not about health. one big scam
"a nation of vaccinculas..a probable scenario when a jab is needed every 6 months, very much making everyone a 'diabetic', requiring daily medication. i really dont know if that is a solution."
"骑虎难下。 riding on an untamed tiger is what we call it. they cannot dictate the vaçcine companies to wipe out the virus. neither do the vaçcine producers can dictate the covid viruses. but dismount from the ""tiger""also face serious risk. that's tantamount to acknowledged their own stupidity of trusting the vaccine producers. that this experimental drug is safe for human. thus their mental calculation is to keep riding on this for as long as they could."
"des chan darpa and moderna have plants set up here. we and the world  should ask why are the vaccines free? lky said ""nothing is free!"" so dont expect  freebies have no strings attached, especially from the messy  will-fighting family who ruled us to eternity.  first, they wanted the elderly to work to 67 due to economic boom; now they make them poorer with 3 lockdowns and endlessly harping vaccines vaccines for their    care of their safety. really? know the law - cant mandate something experimental with side effects. 45, 000 dea ths in us! return merdeka generation cpf in full, let us enjoy before we die, the useless eaters. anyway who pays whose salaries? the covid team is very well fed and very fat indeed during pandemic?"
im not a horse vaccine not working keeps jab 4th 5th icu
three of them hv been ard since 23 jan 2020 till today without breaks.   thats incompetent !!!
without breaks?? sounds like they very hardworking 😂
it's the muppet show
'experts'
do you really need to include the 40 sec countdown at the beginning of every video?
"forsaking peoples lives for money won't be getting my vote. vaccination should not be used to neglect the life-safety of singaporeans by the reckless imports. may 4th, 2020 gky said; ""numbers are important. we need to be assured that community transmission locally is stemmed, or very low,"" said mr gan in his ministerial statement. “community cases should ideally fall to zero or single-digits daily, with very low numbers of unlinked cases, not just for one day, but sustained over a period of time."" what a ministerial statement? but what a joke,. - the multi tusk force instead of tackling the covit-19 virus, will be tackling the people with their version of updates and rojak definition instead so as to achieve their goals. flip-flopping all over. ultimately the miw will be held fully responsible for all these, regardless."
singapore should lift every restrictions and lives as per normal... don't be fooled by the flu...
"accountability is apparently one of the roots of the problems and meritocracy must be inherent in the system of leadership, which points to the fact that single party mandate is highly suspected to be not working. example, singaporeans at large are zero-tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated. also, leaders should be seen to be correct, no excuse accepted example how can the 4 doctors know better than the medical chief? as we recalled, moh rebutted the 4 doctors' masking advice."
"thanks goodness the border measures are now eased!!! aviation is back, and singapore is back!!!"
"on the 17th aug, 90-year-old ""fully vaccinated"" singaporean man up lorry from covid-19 complications; 6th in a month. the vaxin does not confers immunity. vaccination should not be used to neglect the life-safety of singaporeans by the reckless imports. and to make the matters worse, mom has the audacity to resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from 10 aug. this was announced in the press release by ministry of health on friday evening (6 aug). and lw said the virus will leak into the communities from time to time, so they knew."

singapore is back?? back from where?? delusional!! things will never return to normal again !! never ever !!
it's a covic 19 booster.....
heightened alert will be back
"whatever it is, we all must stay safe...."
were these reporters actually paid attention to what the ministers were saying!? especially the last few.... ... felt like they were just doing something else instead of listening when the ministers was talking and only turn to their camera when they were called....
awesome speeches!
check out for acquired immune-deficiency syndrome in coming months. blood test shows cd4 dropping drastically.
why must there always be a chinese translation only?  why no malay and tamil translation?
"because   media thinks more  chinese  singaporean cannot understand english,,,"
when will we open up ourselves like our european counterparts...?those unvaccinated employees are denied work at their workplaces...the same goes for the self employed...not only are they being denied work at their workplaces which some do solely depend on for their living...many are also facing restrictions for months...if they are to be released from restrictions...release them...they are not prisoners...it is not right to have their livelihoods denied off them when they don't take their jabs...many do suffer from depressions and other forms of sicknesses related to being depressed...be it mentally or physically plus body aches other than covid 19...it has been going on for a long time and i do believe it is not a good situation too...
"what is the daily infection rate in s'pore from 14 feb to 19 feb, 2022?"
"the tone in his voice doesn't inspire confidence even if it's good news. close to 20,000 is a sign of incompetence. expectations?"
"“our government cares more for the economy than it’s people”. why so, how so? are the people independent of the economy? when the economy collapses it’s the people who suffer when they lose their jobs. go ahead and do a simple search! what happens to people in countries where the economy has collapsed?  “the ministers earn so much money they can’t be bothered.” well guess what? with their ability and skills they can earn so much more if they weren’t minsters! and in those higher paying jobs they won’t have to deal with people (who can’t see the bigger picture) criticising their every move. yet here they are, tiring themselves for the people. when are we going to stop being so ungrateful? a country has so many things to worry about. can anyone else who’s complaining step up and do a better job taking all things into consideration? closing schools, sure! what happens when kids have to stay at home? yes, someone will have to stay at home (instead of working). can parents handle that? or are they already pulling their hair a month after watching their kids?"
i hearsay. read from somewhere. that someone in that circle had difficulty finding job outside.
"the symptoms i had were just a normal cough symptoms with sore throat. don’t worry and it’s nothing serious at all. however, the grey area is how people can ensure if they fully recovered from covid since there are many cases where art shows negative but pcr shows still positive. now pcr to ensure you are fully recovered is more important than pcr to ensure you test positive."
u vaxed?
this panel is as useless as the vaccine is
"i ask my oversea friends about our situation, apparently oversea seems to do something similar. it could be just us catching up with what oversea people are doing. we're just late in that matter of making this discussion."
"in the meantime, the 2022 air show just like 2020 continues."
5 seconds into the video and i am already done with them
they are going to make a lot of people into huge problems. these is a bunch of blood sucker.
stable???? hmmmmm
from daily 800 stable until yesterday 24000
why nursing home suspended they need family to come.its unfair.
just close school lah the covid and omicron cases increasing. more students and teachers getting affected
after 9 mins... i stop listening... and shake my head..  those are not promise...  let us and see what happen in the next few weeks.
please don't try to manipulate people mind.
not manipulate if they just read from the script
now fully vacci  also easy easy omicron thks
"omicorn is  our booster shots, hahaha,,,one over, they will introduceyouthe fourth shot  and give another name for new strain"
thanks  that country  given so number 😷 gone few year
how many deaths per day?
all this due to a bowl.of bat soup
ccp latest invention = bioweapon
"why only that bat have the virus but not the past, or now?"
"not anti vaccination but anti vaccine science and big pharma bullshit. look at moderna’s books. 800+ million dollar company in 2019, now it’s a whopping 16+ billion dollars company. wake up people wake up. why doyouneed medication when you are not sick. current science is money making business. we are no more patients. we became clients and customers to the medical industry."
not to ease but simplify wtf?🤬  playing and playing with words. how long more want to simplify and ease but not normal again?
all our minister look exhausted. thank you for good job done for singapore and  singaporean. 我们所有的部长看起来都筋疲力尽了。 感谢您为新加坡和新加坡人所做的出色工作。
"canadian truckers have performed a conclusive scientific experiment:  more than 2 weeks of mass hugs, handshakes, close proximity from all over canada=&gt; zero infection, zero hospital cases, zero truckers in  icus. conclusion : the canadian government is lying 😂."
poke & poke but never watch project veritas? misinformation? pretend not to know?
"canadian truckers have performed a conclusive scientific experiment:  more than 2 weeks of mass hugs, handshakes, close proximity from all over canada=&gt; zero infection, zero hospital cases, zero truckers in  icus. conclusion : the canadian government is lying 😂."
do they know what they are doing?
doyouknow what they are doiñg?
ya. sitting in a gathering of move than 2. without much safe distancing. without mask.
you better buck up. ttkoh124 taking your seat liao.🤣
"guess from this pandemic, we singaporean ought to wake up. our govt only cares & worried over the economy than the ppl. so why should we care for such govt. too much talking and finding ways to press other party down and not looking into the welfare  of the ppl. stop acting as they don't know that it is the middle class singaporean who we are facing the worst challenger in our day to day's meet. with our current salary, many of us are trying to cope up with the high cost in singapore everyday. in the end, it is the middle class singapore falling badly. all our ministers are getting high salary surely they will not know how we suffer. what a lousy govt. very sick and tired of their nato."
most of my friends are recovered well from home. being poor is much scarier than the c19 virus. about:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafez
no worries. c19 cum singapore govt will make all of us poor.
"until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them, this drama will continue. the disease isn't that severe as projected by the media. they are trying to create the social credit system by fooling the people in name of covid. social credit system is the ultimate slavery. every person will be assigned credits. people with low credits will be refused access to shops, malls.. etc. you see.. in emerging set up where people are granted access based on vaccine status,  they will soon replace the vaccine status with credits. so basically if a politician wants to commit atrocity and you oppose it. he can easily isolate you from the society by lowering your credits. imagine the power that you are handing over to the politicians because of your stupidity. still think it's all about the virus??? 🤦"
clowns just step down la shame lost of control. mask wearing ???? so now   all clown now show want look nice nice no need put mask ??? no need fine ? prata
"if the number rises to 50,000 of the omicron corona virus what will the singapore authority and health science authority will do."
blame the unvaccinated. what else?
they may resort to lockdown if the situation goes out of control.
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere in the world. god bless singapore.
"god bless you, when it sneeze."
"it's fortunate that the s'pore govt is morally upright, responsible, capable and competent. it does not lie blatantly and is trustworthy. 👍👍"
lol
spoken like a truly brainwashed citizen
where is the plan? where is the timeline?  responsible = no plan? capable = no courage? competent = no truth?
when do your citizen has a choice to vaccinate our kids with sinovac or sinopharm
🇸🇬 ecosam spray-guns & disinfectant-cleaners
"so a little over a third of a percent of the country tested positive in a single day, and that isn't expected to start dropping for a timescale measured in weeks?  what i'm hearing is ""we expect every single singaporean to be exposed to omicron during this wave, and we are ok with this"".  they've already stated that most vaccinated people exposed to omicron will never test positive, so with that in mind, that makes at least over half a percent, possible a percent or 2 of the population being exposed every single day, for multiple weeks.  you run out of ""unexposed"" population pretty damn fast with infection rates this high. also ""we're not easing restrictions"" does not pair well with ""we are removing a bunch of restrictions"""
most that landed in hospital are people fully vac or partially vac. im just wondering how many unvac person that landed in hospital compare to vac individual?
you will never know because (they) want people to get v_cced regardless
"dear, appreciate statistics. why are there so many vaccinated people in hospital you ask, there are a lot of people who are vaccinated. naturally with this means more people who are vaccinated end up in hospital!"
clowns
the real pandemic is the mtf
"from this pandemic, we can see clearly which are communist countries under the sheep skin of democracy and, which countries are democratic but under the skin of communism. still not sure? which countries placed its people over economy and which countries place economy over ppl?"
bunch of ....u know what.
pls relax more ..hope can be  like turkey one day no need pre departure & on arrival test so long fully vac.. majority still wearing mask outdoor although not mandatory i was really impress that many restaurants regardless cheap or expensive had a big bottle of sanitizer on every table which encouraged me to sanitize hands before & after meals which i feel is effective measure .. they also gave their own prepack alcoholic wipe for each customer… came back after 2 wks free of infection eventhough the streets were crowded singing and dancing
i just wish next election pap wins by a clean sweep in all areas.
fully vaccinated tested positive after 7 days stay home even still tested positive can leave home ?  is this correct ?
"it seems to be! what about the vulnerable, ( people like me with heart disease) aged and babies? are we suppose we suposse to curl up and die?"
"t. c don’t think negatively, i avoid crowded places and stay home more. still can go park on weekdays."
janet tan thank you dear. trying to do so. you stay safe too.
"ya it’s right after 7 days still test positive can go out some even never see doctor tested positive also go around spreading that’s why today figure keep going out, so try not to go out especially hawker centre, market shopping mall , crowded place, public transport stay home keep save 🤣🤣🤣"
andrew ng for how long we going to just stay home
lawrence wong like to listen him talking
ok well done just follow
2yrs smm restrictions after 9% gst whole life
yeah all rules lax already after that gst 9%
wow what a great forecast and preventive measures with reliable risk assessment well done!.
why is pcr test so expensive in singapore as compared to other countries around the world ? honest question....
because rental and profit margins are high - honest answer 😂😂
your wallet&lt;their wallet. keepin it real.
pure business.
"aiyah ! not expensive lah don't compared with other countries lah we temasek give out so many freebies lah from masks, handwash to oximeter lah got to recover some cost lah little bit more expensive never mind lah let our pcr makers earn more $$ then temasek can give out more freebies lah win win solution lah"
expensive? $125 vs rm 150. are you doing currency exchange?
tua pui kia sing $125 is expensive. its only rm 150 in malaysia ?
ho ching global covid university small price difference i can understand but its almost 3 times more compared to many other countries.
ry it's the standard price. the pcr instrument is not cheap if you use the qiagen brand. please don't compare pineapple with apple. rm150 is expensive for local.
tua pui kia and you think $125 is not expensive for local singaporeans ? money is money regardless of where you are from the effectiveness of a pcr test in malaysia is still the same as in singapore so why such a big price difference ? seems like you are the one comparing pineapples and apples and who cares what brand we use ?all we want is whether its positive or negative ?
ry you don't need to keep doing the pcr to get double confirmation. most people depend on art tests and rest at home if they show symptoms.  the pcr service became so expensive because a lot of people prefer to trust pcr than cheap art test kits. about:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafezabout:invalid#zcsafez
cannot afford do not come here. thank you. you are not a locust right...
tua pui kia  got negative on art multiple time despite having positive on pcr n ur here saying why people don’t trust art
"ocswoodlands high rental? sure let's compare to hong kong, the most expensive city in the world to rent.  pcr test in hk (issued from registered clinic): singapored42  pcr test in singapore (issued from registered clinic): singapored110 oh btw cost of living in singapore is no. 1 in asia last year. do you know how? yeah profit margins are high so richman go richer and we, forever slave."
a c come where ? born and bred in singapore. i am asking about price difference not about whether i can afford or not ?

"in warning to u.s., covid rates soar after denmark lifts all restrictions. [ref: yahoo] covid rates soar after country lifts all restrictions denmark became the first major nation to lift the last of its pandemic restrictions. but since, its number of cases and deaths have skyrocketed."
"did you check covid numbers of denmark ? or follow msm read and repeat ? if not yet,  check denmark covid cases on your own... and  the fact now is, no more covid rules  and restriction..... on the 1st feb 45,366 new cases weekly average 43,309 ... on the 18th feb  35,658 new cases and weekly average 39,190 cases"
ada d what's your point?
"record high of 19,420 new covid cases in s'pore, over twice the day before + 7 up lorries [15 feb 2022]; i'll say; reckless gambling; like i say, when people trade your means of livelihoods and trade your life-safeties, will you still accept the ""model"" and will you rely your children future with them? what's up 2025? yesterday 13 more up lorries;"
"these days, trust cannot be simply granted."
integrity?????
"in 2021, i lost all trust in them; sacrifice life, sacrifice jobs; elderly are relegated to make shift facilities; home recovery instead of proper hospital care and despite the highly infectious variants. what else?"
"these days when pap says ""effective"" i want to laugh."
"in another words, children and elderly are relegated to another make-shift facilities other than the proper hospital care. as i have said before; elderly are relegated to a shoddy made-shift mass facility instead of a proper hospital environment. looking like a really shoddy made-shift mass facility with no directional air flow/pressure control, for example, turbulent air flow instead of directional negative pressure environment. the elderly/merdeka deserves better treatments and protection for their life-safety example to have high degree of certainty of zero cross-contamination. please respect our elderly better."
so if social distancing then don’t need mask ah?
singaporean are more sick of the measures than the virus... let's ease all measures and lives our life as per normal....
yes sick and tired of this measures! mttf should change mindset its endemic just move on and remove all restrictions
"already very high number of cases, bring back zero covid-19 policy. actions now not sleep again and let cases shoot up."
means don’t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
"kenneth mak already said there is no concrete plan for 4th dosage. anyway, we have procured the covid treatment pill. that should be enough … barring a new variant."
u turn will come soon....
one also haven’t taken 🤣
the plan is 5
calvink will have new variant. no worry's.
"asd rion not just new variant but new viral species. it’s natural biology to have pandemics. just like there will always be diseases, isn’t that true?"
hopefully new zealand will be added soon. these are beautiful vast countries for travelling.
how come not showing the number of vaccinated death anymore? what is moh hiding?
gotta thank pap for making the country a super spreader.
still can't go au for holiday 😭
chiby face
positivity is more than 9% now!
number to hit 10000
more cases above 5000 and many more deaths and we are talking opening borders like nobody's business !
"so, big deal? the number of deaths from covid in singapore backyard is something more even bigger deal to deal with."
so rush to open. should have at least wait for everyone to take up 3rd shot first then see how.
yeah switzerland!!!
"many people worldwide are protesting hard against vaccine mandates n vaccine passports. many doctors, nurses, firefighters, police, military soldiers, teachers etc are striking and walking out of their jobs to protest the jab-or-job vaccine mandates!"
"where are all the folks gone ?.. before the new restrictions limiting dine in to only vaccinated customers in coffee shops. there was a good number of customers at these places. even with the two to a table limit. but now, if you care to notice, most coffee shops have a sparse look, while qs can be seen for take away. the same thing at the fast food outlets. the take away and delivery people far outnumber the dine in folks. this is odd, since 84% of the population are vaccinated and should have no problem as dine in customers. why did the crowd thin out so abruptly ?"
because the vexsinated know they are the speedy silent super spreaders!! all better avoid dine in say no to vexsin !!
god's amazing grace another explanation could be that the vaccinated percentage could be lower than stated.
maybe the high vaccinated numbers just a smoke screen.
welcome... welcome... everyone spent your money here...
yes. spend your $$ for covid treatment here…

finally some common sense from the singapore government
"iss report no 15/2021 - long-covid management principles. version of july 1, 2021. chronic symptoms that preclude a full return to the previous state of health.  it has become clear that, for a considerable proportion of individuals affected by covid-19, significant clinical manifestations may persist after the first weeks of the acute symptomatic phase, with a heterogeneous complex of subacute and chronic symptoms that preclude a full return to the previous state of health. this persistence of symptoms, which may affect patients of any age and with varying degrees of severity of the acute disease, has been recognized as a specific clinical entity, called long-covid.  we would like to hear from the govt, their responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients."
"apparently they donate funds away, only seen to be helping to boosting himself then to answer and face the pertinent question above."
"14 more cases up lorries, while 107 are unstable in icu and 18,278 are in hr [new peak] essential ""deprived""."

it will be very soon

now vtl has became virus travel lane...omg..
this is what you call living with covid. shut everything again when a new weaker variant is found. lmao
stop vtl air not land most viruses came thru airport first. why so gundu
"instead of having incoming travelers stay at home, wouldn't it make more sense to have them isolated away from home first, in hotels for the incubation period, in case they infect the people at home with omicron? this was the protocol before."
"now then suspend  vtl, don't you think it's too late,  virus already come in!! why always wait until the virus come in then government act!!!  only suspend vtl with malaysia or the europe countries too??"
rigidity or stu??????
thank you xi jinping! still hiding in beijing for past two years watching ppl die around the world the biggest terrorist the world has seen after hitler yet people are quiet no sanctions yet?
"it is clear that omicron is already in our community. the 3 anytime fitness omicron cases had not travelled abroad nor were they close contacts of the confirmed omicron cases (imported and community).  the key consideration therefore is not the detected cases so far but rather the undetected cases which we know are already present. yes the freeze on vtls are long overdue given the escalating omicron situation in many of our vtl partner countries, but still better late than never."
💜💜💜💜💜
those already purchased vtl tickets should get 14 days quarantine when they return back. this is a loophole
hush up
"it is no big deal.  govt is expecting it.  many singaporean who are concerned about omicron are also expecting this. so far no death reported by other countries except 1 death in uk.  really doubtful about uk death report. it is a tactics? living with covid expect  such things to happen. just have to upgrade to omicron.  the world is round, people travel around. sharing virus is inevitable. it was once said everyone will catch covid. we are not safe unless the world is safe.  vaccines doesn't prevent us from catching covid virus or else there wont be any home recovery cases.  it  reduce the degrees in our flu discomfort and freedom to move around. i don't think the statement saying that everyone will catch covid is correct. either you choose to take risk, you choose covid or covid choose you despite of precautions taken and still catch it. it is inevitable."

israel prepares for 4th jab to combat omicron spread.
if we followed north korea close the borders since day 1 we wouldnt  end up like that anyway so much resources wasted sporeans expected to be blamed again
good move! hope no increase of cases due to omicron.
well done our transport minister. stop all incoming flight temp wait and see for 2 weeks.
2 years more realistic.
"opening up of borders when a relatively new virus is at an onset stage is the  stupidest and very wrong  thing to do!  the authorities are putting the health of not just flight and ground crews  at risk,  but unnecessary stress on medical staff who are seriously in need of  their long  overdue breaks after working overtime, during the recent mass exodus and fighting hard to save patients' lives.  run the country with a heart and not just brains with economic growth in mind."
screw the elderly. save the economy for future generation instead.
digitales 000 omg what happened to humanity… the elderly could be your parents or grandparents too
it's funny to see how singaporeans don't realise they'll become completely irrelevant if the government doesn't try to keep things somewhat functional.
"ferrari’s driver charles leclerc was infected twice this year  ( 2021） with the covid19 virus in january, december . in a high profile sports like formula 1 racing , drivers and pit crews are vaccinated.    so with 3 jabs of man-made vaccines and 2 covid19 infections , it does not seem to afford any protection?"
bad thing for changi airport and airlines. 😔😞
too late !!!
2 weeks too late. mmtf squandered the opportunity to delay community outbreak of omicron. seeyou5000
you need evidence in everything right?  now you have your evidence in an economically painful way
very smart move..... clap clap 👏
stop incoming flights before singapore will suffer because of imported omicron virus to safeguard singaporeans.
"omicron infectious rate is at least 4 times more than d variant.   as usual, we are screwed again"
i thought we supposed to open up and live with covid ? 🤭
u bought their story?
"yes, and with what we have seen from the beggining of this pandemic, it was always going to be a few steps forward and occasionally a step or twi back.  no one could predict what or where a new setback will occur beyond a narrow set of circumstances.  even the few unicorns among us are facing new set backs or worst, are no longer mentioned as an example for the rest of the world.  the benefit of hindsight will bring forth many who like to  show proof that their bet was a winner after an issue had passed but their overall winning odds are not much different from all those who were wrong on that particular bet."
"the all seeing eye talk is cheap. action please. we need all patriots to quickly take the boosters. and your kids and grand kids too. so that you can take the 4th shot asap. so mr all seeing, have you done your part?"
"lots of omicron infected have entered singapore,  we are screwed again by incompetent leaders !!!"
😂🤣😂🤣😂  prata flipping time....incompetent in charge expect more.
now you say flip prata. if no action taken you say they value money over lives.
"as i said so much earlier, it is not the time to open up. so many imported cases of  imported omicorn causing lea"
"causing leakage into community. see what happens now, got cluster of community omicorn"
the flip flop never end in the farmland...
poor leadership
hahaha coming soon 4th booster on the way for adults 🤣🤣🤣🤣💉💉💉💉 this is definitely some kind of experiment already
noway i'm not going for the 4th dose..which later we've to go for 5th dose then i'll be omegone.
kenneth lange i can’t even use the word de population 😱
"wait for it, soon they will make it like an insulin shot. take weekly :d"
shivam singhal nah that won’t happen
open close open close really singapore jocking with other country
phase 2
should act sooner as most of the omicorn cases are imported. now the omicorn already in singapore...causing our citizen fear and anxiety.

"clowning is as clown does... good observation, indeed ... perhaps the next round in the making, some wise men are in charge..."
should be paying hundreds instead of millions
no one can predict omnicron or manicron...
that's a responsible decision by the capable s'pore govt.
"however, not responsible when they rush to open"
laggard action by the highest paying ministers in the world. singapore will be in the doldrums in the hands of the incompetents.

some things just can't be rush.
"aiyo until now than stop selling vtl ticket is too late to turn back the clock at present numbers of people kena, see and learn from other country la."
hi!
"open, close, open, close....joke la mtf."
you have better idea that can balance the needs of everyone? don't be a joke yourself.
"close, complain. dont close also complain. knn you think you have better idea?"
like playing accordion music.
"simply because vaccines don't work against transmission of virus, not against delta and definitely not against omicron. still pushing boosters? are they out of their mind?"
please add philippines to green list
"明知山有虎 偏向虎山行=找死。translate: ""you know there are tigers in the mountain and yetyoudecide to go into the mountain = suicidal"". mtf knows the dangerous omnicron variant is spreading fast and potentially can evade immunity and render vaccine useless and yet still opening up more vtl??? i dun know what to say. then when omnicron reaches here and hits the economy and kills singaporeans, they will blame singaporeans for not following safety measures and causing omnicron to spread?"
similar to opening up a cage and letting poison snakes bite you
"500 x more infectious  no problem, just need 500 booster shots for lrrr, ruler of the planet omicron persei 8."
"pls also be much more vigilant with uk. they have a lot f travellers with south africa. as i hear from german scientists, the thing they call omicron now is super-aggressive."
"deadly africa variant, probably have reach singapore. singapore is opening up like there is no tomorrow.  will know in two weeks time."
no opening no tomorrow.  hong kong closed very tight but they came too.
fiost hong kong 2 cases by far. singapore with its liberal opening will see 10x or even 100x of hong kong cases.
wuhan virus
"if hong kong is your model country, then you must be very sad now. what does it teach us?  no matter how closed you are, the virus can find their way in. the defense should be vaccination."

"with so many v t ls launched, omicron, like the delta, will most likely be imported by air."
"in fact, without super-easy global mass travel, the entire pandemic would have been far not as bad. i suspect that these times are over. get used to it. changi airport ... ?  - better have a different plan."
i am sure the new african variant is impossible to enter singapore via vtl countries. looking forward to xmas surprises
new south africa variant on the way
"heard of this before... when china started the covid and when ""south asia"" covid started spreading. in the end, both managed to penetrate our border and cause huge destructions becos our mtf reactive and slow to react with decisive and bold moves in feb of 2020 and march of 2021. now africa's turn to penetrate ..."

singapore is still okay. well managed by mtf
"fiost they are looking for volunteers. you can join them. with your superior supervisory skills, you can take us out of this pandemic. we are counting on you🙂"
"yes, let us wait for fiost to take us out of this pandemic before you say bravo. unless we see death rates down to zero, you can clap🙂."
"i give up figuring out how these idiots think. they'll destroy the sia and changi airport brand if they're not careful. imagine if you're a tourist from the uk. you plan your itinerary expecting there's no quarantine. you book your flight and hotel. but because there's a spike in cases in the uk, you're informed 3 day before departure that singapore has imposed a 10 day quarantine. you've spent thousands of dollars but you're left with no choice but to cancel your trip. with 27 vtls, multiply that by 27 and our reputation as a tourist hub is destroyed."
"they detected the south african guy during quarantine. vtls, no quarantine. see how dangerous that is? most of us do art ourselves and report to the boss. art does not differentiate between variants. so how the hell are we to know if the sa variant has arrived in our shores?"

hong kong closed like hell  still came.🤣🤣🤣
somebody making a fool of himself using emojis. no original idea. just riding on my coattails. i'll just ignore him.
fiost that's because they are waiting for you to visit hk. sure get vip welcome.
fiost only fools like you believes omicron has not reached our shores. it may already be hiding in your closet.
richard w  so let it be. get vaccinated and protect yourself
"better rush for vtl and travel while you can. once sa variant arrive, cb time! seow liao lor! delta is now so old news 2021, 2022 will be this new variant."
wuhan virus is still fresh in my mind
let’s f up the world.
by????

"only 1 ?😂😂🤣😂🤣  if it is highly contagious 1 can spread to several tens or hundreds .  if hong kong has it,  more already got it."

when i circulate my 🍌 it also mutate to monster 🍌
typical fire fighters tactic.  incompetents are waiting for singapore to  caught fire before they decide to take action.   till than  whole country is on fire.  thats too late
🤣😂🤣😂  africa variant does not deter incompetents.   only when it arrives and spread beyond control then they will take action.   till then  its too late !!!!
"who said """"the more covid 19 circulates, the more opportunity this virus has to change to mutate and develop different forms, it is essential that we all continue to work to reduce the circulation of covid 19."""""
well said. let’s watch the mtf scrambles when the sa strains reach our shore.
when that happens they just reduce the number of dine in pax from 5 to 2 and then zero. we see that pattern how many times already? that's why i keep saying they must keep the unvaccinated bogeyman story going otherwise nobody else to blame but themselves.
the whiners are camping here🤣🤣🤣
"does anyone know why the same idiot keeps appearing and making a fool of himself? he has nothing to offer. just the same old worn out word with a few emojis scattered around. nothing but riding on our coattails. quite shameless, actually."

2 years back...  batam to singapore ferry fully book...  cause lot of singaporean working there or got a family there...  most of them bought 1month ticket...  now travel bubble for us not worth it...  wait till fully open eat seafood at tangjong paiyu👍 iga bakar bebek bakar  masakkan sunda semuanya mantap tunggu buka penuh bebas quarantine bebas kemana aja👍
singapore should be banned from the banking system. removing singapore from the swift system would give singapore an incentive to stop racism.
grow up.
45641560456405640563 singapore isn't an international player. micro managing lives of citizen is an crime.
daniel hew yeah thanks for that really relevant contribution.
nah. is just transferring yourself from a jail to a nicer jail. cant go to eat my seafood and go to harbour bay. as long as cant go to harbour bay it is waste of time.
you are paying to be treated like prisoner. what crime did you commit to deserve this type of treatment?
"what so special about vtl when to enter the ferry terminal you already need to be vaccinated, isn't everyone in the area vaccinated"
"one must be crazy to travel to batam now when so many better, freer, safer, more developed countries let you in without an art result or tracing app."
"let me get this straight. travellers can go to batam but only confined to nongsa resort area and never get to go to main attractions like nasi padang restaurants, cheap cinemas, malls, seafood restaurants by the sea, wet markets, delicious street foods, turtle eggs, ktv etc......even those who have families or friends there wont get to see them because the locals outside nongsa area and singaporeans cant mingle. so whats the hype about singaporeans able to meet families and friends again????????"
i think you can visit other places and stay at other hotels but there's going to be quarantine
true. they should allow singaporeans to visit the entire island and not just the confined areas.
why are we so pleased in promoting medical apathied?.. anyone still sleeping?
there is no reason to visit another gulag from our very own gulag.
"can not visit batam ktv no use also, uncles will get bored."
its like holiday prison
correct bro a holiday resort alias prison vacation
no points going there but isolate in resort.
exactly!
not worthit at all no point having this travel buble or vtl because i as a singaporean still couldn't visit or see my family members in batam or they my family members are barred from coming to the resort place where we are staying so what good is that having travel bublé or vtl👎👎😤😤🙉🙉
no more geylang now i go to batam loh!

"hello sir , is it possible to travel from singapore to malaysia then from malaysia to thailand and then india ??"
for singapore-malaysia- you need to have last 14 days spent in singapore because that is the eligibility criteria for vtl lanes. there are direct flights from malaysia to thailand and also they are opening land borders in southern thailand.
sir 1 separate  vedio bny jisme india se singapore short term visa shuru se aakhir singapore pahunchne tk sare doccumenta a to z
thankyousir
welcome
"hi, ca i ask, if i have only connecting flight to singapore and my entry destination dont need rt pcr test, do i still have to present rt pcr test in singapore even if its just my connecting flight? thank you in advance!"
for transits they are not asking for any on-arrival pcr test unless it is the requirement of your final destination.
hi sir gud evng i going to india from singapore need to take pcr or not
you have to get your rt-pcr test done from india there is no on-arrival pcr test now and that has been replaced with the self-test anti-gen test
extrm good time for buying etherum and bitcoin and hodl!$!$!$!$!$!
i going to india feb 26 i have 2dose vaccine need to take pcr test or not
no need for rt-pcr upon arrival in india. just simply to registration on the air-suvidha and upload your vaccine certificates.
philippine visa arrival update
sure i will check and let you know
philippine updated
as usual perfect update and to the point sir thanks a lot
always welcome
hi sir i fly 6march to singapore 48hours covid test important
"yes, one test is mandatory from the home country"
"bro, thailand and india airbubble  is official now from 21st feb"
"yes dear, thanks for the update. annouced through the channel. more good news no rt-pcr test, sha++ booking on the 5th day required. insurance also reduced to $20000 usd."
just like we need to book vtl flights while booking for singapore tickets .. is it necessary to book vtl flights while returning too ??
you can travel through non- vtl flight but they insist to have one pnr only
thanks for your video. what about self isolation for vtl travellers? is it not applied now?
"sir , please help me i booked flight amritsar to singapore and singapore to canada on 22 april .will this flight possible or not from amritsar"
nice vlog sir
thanks a lot
what is vtl stands for????
"vaccinated travel lanes, that means all the people traveling through flights must be fully vaccinated"
thewanderingman abroad thanks 🙏🏻👍🏻 me baat aur batao bhardwaj ji singaporear mujhe philippines jana hai via singapore visa to kya process hai abhi thanks in advance 🙏🏻
welcome. philippines ke liye pehle multi-entry visa hota tha singapore ka usme visa-on-arrival mil jata tha. abhi philippines sift unhone visa free countries ke liye khola hai jo un countries ke passport holders hain yaan nationals. vaise indian can enter philipplines because they are giving approvals to the people who have covaxin. so as a reciprocal arrangement we can enter.  singapore embassy se check karna parega ki agar vo abhi multi-entry visa issue kar rahe hain yaan nahi.
"thanks for the update 👍 is it allowed to transit via singapore now? if i remember right, there were some restrictions for transit via singapore 🤔"
yes you can transit through singapore but getting transit visa is still no opened. single pnr flight will be good.
thewanderingman abroad thank you!
when will singapore be open for bangladeshi travelers?
sir total kharcha kitna hai singapore tourist visa ka room flight food please tell me
sure i need to check it could be more than 1lacs
what’s vtl?
vaccinated travel lanes in which everyone needs to be vaccinated in a flight
thanks for the another helpful information for travelers. i am going back to australia. i booked 4 nights in singapore. thankfully save my $$125 on arrivel psr test at changi.
you are always welcome. also they have waived-off self-test atk testing for day 2nd and 7th.
manjit bhaji tuc visa free transit facility avail keeti c?
this is a very big and major relief... 125 singapored bach jayenge aur ye bohut hi big amount hai
"yes, another big update which i think i forgot to cover in the video. the additional testing requirement on 2nd and 7th days is also not required now. i have pinned the  comment under the video"
"thewanderingman abroad now i can plan my trip, but i still have one question, is it required to book on any specific designated private accomodation or i can book any acoomodations even if it is shared."
"point to be noted: good news: 2nd and 7th day atk test has also been removed- if i have forgotten to cover this in the video. however, a self-administered test is still there but you need not submit or show your test results. please refer to this: https://safetravel.ica.gov.singapore/vtl-land/travel-checklisthttps://safetravel.ica.gov.singapore/vtl-land/travel-checklist thanks,"
thank you for update 🙂

"so can pap govt finally keep the tourists under 14 days quarantine now? we know it's your money, but our family's safety"
"merck pharmaceuticals has been approved for ""covid pills"" in the united states. kmv"
need those foreign labojrs
i think the government is making a very deadly decision which it will regret later.this new virus will surely be transmitted via this way.
johannesburg has 6 direct flights a day with mumbai. seeyou5000
government who care less for safety of singaporeans
"1 second ago well when we get the new variant and become worst again, then these people starts pointing fingers at each other. in the mean time money are more important. 💩"
suicidal decision. fatal act. singapore is doomed. we will soon be famous again for the wrong reason.
remove both buttons🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

"pap has lost their mind ! vtl with indonesia and india at this time is madness  especially  when countries like israel, japan and morocco are banning foreign travellers."
india more nearer to africa and indians are almost everywhere in 7 continents of the world..so the chances of them carrying the virus is greater than indonesia..and the current indonesian govt support peace and progress in south east asia than their previous predecessor....imagine if no covid but indonesia not happy with spore also doesnt work well for us and our economy or is it we use to this kind of peace that we take it for granted
they always do what is right in their own eyes

"of all countries,  why them? 🕧 is ticking for new virus coming in. ☺"
maybe becuase their positivity rate is lower than yours.
prasenjit banerjee really?  ppl living in toxic air polluted land has a lower positive rate?  ☺
mo zart that’s the best you got? come back later buddy.
"mo zart btw, in case you don’t know. yes! lower positivity rate."
prasenjit banerjee that's whatyouthink. at rural area undeclared. whole world knows it. 😂
prasenjit banerjee cant accept reality? give genuine facts whenyouhv one...buddy..😂
"mo zart i think you know something more than everyone knows, also you seem to have a strong personal bias, which is why you quipped with things like polluted land, toxic air, totally unrelated to discussion point, the fact is that singapore had a higher positivity rate with very large clusters. in a few places, the fact is out there to be seen, also adding a smiley at the end of a comment does not make things funny, just shows the lack of ability to have a civil discussion. 'over and out'"
"prasenjit banerjeebias? really?  you ppl aren't funny but amuse me and probably others with unrealistic medical logic. hope this is a civilize discussion for u. see, no smiley."
