do you have to book the pcr test at klia before arrival ?
access to good information is what we investors need to progress financially and generally in life . here is a good one and am grateful .
"please include philippines also . we are so super stretch , drained and stress away from our family . i hope you compassionately consider it ."
"omicron is mutated thirty-two times , thats making existing vaccines inffective and useless . it is highly contagious , several times worst than d variant . if it hit singapore the spread will be quick n unstoppable . it is irresponsible to ignore new variants and continue to open up freely ."
"they are welcoming omicron into singapore !!! when they screw up , they will push the blame and punish singaporeans . they never apologize , resign or take responsibility n accountability !!! thats dictatorship system !!!"
sg so small . one mth omicron sapu all .
more vaccines are being developed and produced ... just to convince people worldwide that these vaccines are effective and are needed to protect people against corona virus ... yet another sly tactic to market the vaccines to make money ...
just open lah to foreign country so bored no foreigners here
no need to worry
upto five hundred % more infectious than delta .
singapore : welcome omicron ! we would like to sincerely welcome you to our country . here you are exempted from any taxes and are free to roam .. if you get what i mean ! hope you enjoy your stay !
singaporeans just can ’ t wait to welcome to the new variant .
"just like d variant , the only means for new variant to enter singapore is from external . only those who has the power to do so can welcome new variant . not singaporeans !"
"too many airport terminals , so lan2 have to open border"
when they screwed up ( failed to block d variant entry ) they blame and punish pple . nv apologise . truly incompetent !!!!!
des chan really ? they supported the system that economy over lives and thus responsible for the virus !
they will come without invitation . no need to welcome
"new covid variant have likely reach singapore , will know in two or three weeks time ."
a flight from sa to holland yesterday was found to have thirty-nine pax who were infected . this virus is reported to be five hundred % more infectious than delta .
"jo marko500 x more infectious no problem , just need five hundred booster shots for lrrr , ruler of the planet omicron persei eight ."
they blamed the karaoke operators for being irresponsible . are they not the bigger karaoke operators inviting foreigners without quarantine ?
no need to quarantine lah . be open and let s have some country immunity .

everybody travels for a different reason out of necessity . please come party in singapore . and don t forget to bring your own version of covid nineteen as you would your twelve year old johnny walker .
tim loo1 do you really understand what he is saying ???
boosters ... here i come .
omicron is coming ! oh malaysia god !
only covid ends the world will be normal tis vaccinated travel lane all useless . traveling means happiness tis vaccinated travel lane traveling must travel with covid in the mind
it s ok . the mmtf will safely import in the latest newfangled strain from all over the world as a leading aviation hub thumbs_up
yes we will live with them . it s perfectly normal
"singaporeans have never been consulted with , and it is solely the miw decision . these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
good to vent some frustration here . to have some control in this scale of challenge
bochapliao yes you read right . living with the virus . endemic living .
"so hoping that singapore should also ban hong kong , belgium , israel and countries that open to south africa ( sa ) on top of banning sa ."
read carefully what those msm like reuters nov twenty-six say : and this become the basis for all those pharma - sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens .
omicron will arrv sooner than expected . source - yahoo twenty-seven nov twenty-one
"and those who want to sleep , sleep sleeping_face"
"fiost yes , that would be you slightly_smiling_face. safe and sound ."
"lawrence wong said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there would be leaks from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “ risk ” because as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore ? why must they keep importing from higher risk countries ?"
the fear tactics have to end now . if not open and close borders will never end .
wat safety as d buses on wk end to orchard ed full pk .. no safe distance too
are you groping on women ?
stop reporting on covid surges .. not really . atna ... really .
"fair la , the virus whack hari raya , deepavali , and now christmas , sure chinese new year also affected ."
living with the virus is wrong . it is a breeding ground for mutants . who said
omicron will test the singapore government on whether they learnt anything from delta . balek to two person dining together .
read carefully what those msm like reuters nov twenty-six say : and this become the basis for all those pharma - sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens .
ttkoh123 they just want $$$$$$$$$$$$$
jab jab ... lol . this is your new normal . you asked for it .
"to be fair , the stock been going toohigh , it s expected to come down anyway . just that the corona make the down worse thinking_face everyone been taking bout the stock coming down soon for a while even before the corona mutation news"
this guy is going to get united states into very serious problem . the nu variant is going review how naive he is .
they just want money
thats the reason always the word ... never learnt at all
"fiost .. you and ong ye kung can sleep in one room hor , understand the sentence carefully in his latest speech ... then tiok like delta variant then kanciong to re - act ... lmfao grinning_squinting_facegrinning_squinting_face"
in a rush to open borders to so many countries almost all at once . risk of losing control of the situation will definitely increase . singapore is such a small country ... where is it going to get the resources needed to properly manage the situation ?
yes .. the big big risk is losing control .
every country will get this virus eventually
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
we do not want this happen in singapore but they want what can you do ? nothing we can do right ?
the big problem is that we are snall and overcrowded . secondly too many people coming in and leaving .
exactly how i look each time i get malaysia nose poked
sure there are some ahole will misuse the vaccinated travel lane bypass and spread the virus ...
what happen to the dislike ?? is ytube controll by the f ... king peoples action party s pore govt ??
"lim and then what you want them to ? make united states hide for another year ? you re vaccinated , you have your mask , its your own perogative to hide and lower your viral load . you still die from covid , simply your own immune system that lousy ."
new jabs for everyone for every new mutants
read carefully what those msm like reuters nov twenty-six say : and this become the basis for all those pharma - sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens .
fiost all vaccine makers are currently testing the effectiveness of existing vaccines against new mutant . it might take around two weeks . there is possibility they might tweak the chemical content of current vaccine to account for this new variant .
read carefully what those msm like reuters nov twenty-six say : and this become the basis for all those pharma - sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens .
"flying horse foul - ci is advocating for quarterly booster shots . the sa b . one . one . five hundred and twenty-nine super strain , appeared as if by magic over thanksgiving holiday . a plan long ago to make up new fabricated strains every three - six months . to frighten ppl to take more shots ."
wow stella i ’ m really having trouble understanding what you are saying . maybe express properly ?
bryan wang a scam ! clear ? rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
mark oakley i just sent him a message and he responded . thanks a lot !
"as i have said , and it s outright risky . endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure ."
new strain in africa and african lion ? i urge not to use the term african to avoid some from misperceiving racist remarks . we should can the new strain mutant x . that older strain found in india we also call it south asian right ? so we must continue to welcome and support ceca
its only a matter of time before the new variant gets in through a vtl
all the variants travel by airlines .
absolutely true and no because for alarm . every country including china will get it live as usual and get vaccinated
"i hope for once the singapore authorities and medical experts are ahead of the curve to proactively manage the advent of the variant because the vaccine may not work as well .... for one , vaccinated travel lane from the united kingdom should be modified with some form of supervised quarantine as this is a country most exposed to travellers from the african continent ...."
omicron will arrv sooner than expected . source - yahoo twenty-seven nov twenty-one
you see ! he is in pain !!!!! which dumb doctor came up with this torture method to test covid ?!?!?
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
"cannot close border forever , if planes go bankrupt people can never travel ever again ."
"okay , let anybody who wants to travel , travel . anyone who scared covid just self quarantine at home . problem solved !"
exactly . already a better solution than the mmtf .
"the guy who wants to travel , is the problem , dude . the new variant will come into singapore from changi airport ."
meanwhile the unvaxed can t even earn a living .
"thulomanchay actually , if you look at dr steven quay s lab report during the hearing at covid gop conference , he mentions that with each mutation , the virus becomes weaker , never more effective , that includes the rate of transmission . the chance that it becomes more effective is less than one % even through very clever used of ninety-nine . five % optimised forced combinations of the covid hotspot gene code sequence is almost impossible ."
woofwoofchs its true the other way too ... it just need to combine / mutate with another to make it more transmissible / more deadlier .. shrugs .
locals will be living their lives here like prisoners the foreigners will be roaming around freely by spreading virus in our country ! your end time coming soon !
"auyong ah meng did you watch the hearing ? even if its done cleverly under perfect lab conditions with multiple successes , and not a single failure throughout several years , its still zero . one % chance aka almost impossible for it to be more transmissable or deadlier ."
"avijeet well , tell that to the doctor who presented his work and lab studies at the covid gop conference . the guy has been working on covid since sars , is unbiaised , has one of the best credentials with regards to this virus ."
"it ’ s not in yet . it will spread like wildfire since it ’ s new . please dun use one key for all locks . it ’ s not going to work , malaysia six year old knows that"
we will use many keys and many locks . get vaccinated is one key or lock ? ask your six year old
is just a matter of time . crying_face
it will come here eventually . be prepared
"yeah right . so by introducing vaccinated travel lane in singapore Singapore changi airport , delta variant clusters won ’ t mutate right ?????? face_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joyrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing seriously !!!!!! naive and gullible thinkaporeans in majulah kita singapura island desert_islandrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing"

lions having covid is sooo wrong .
"yea , considering from who they got it from ."
govt should start preparing for hospital capacity to be ready for this . being more severe n immunity to vaccines would mean stay home recovery would not be possible
delta is scared of our whining
clicked because alex karp is in the thumbnail
"so now the spike protein has been improved and made one hundred % more lethal , knowing that the virus was never isolated and thus lab - manufactured . welcome to covid two . zero upgraded version ."
we can t lockdown forever . we all will own nothing and be happy eh ?
they expose united states to the virus then they punish the unvaxx .. nice ...
safety is just a word only
so is fear
"why only from sunday ? should be closed to travellers from those seven regions immediately . it was first detected in mid - nov and one infected traveller each has already gone to hong kong and israel as of today . who knows how many they have already infected by now . if the target is to prevent entry of the variant into our country while more research is done , then border closure to these seven regions should be done immediately . the worst factor is that the four cases found in botswana were all foreigners on a diplomatic mission and have all already left the country . diplomats ! they could have gone anywhere since .... and might even have been accorded special quick access based on their status as diplomats ."
"and so we roll the dice again , hoping against hope that we do not find disaster at our door once more . i am keeping malaysia fingers crossed ."
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
the product is either good or bad depend on the materials
"fiost in ths case , it s bad material .. so , bad product"
"fiost if you admit tht ur bad , thn ur mad . same goes to marketing products .. especially whn you force n threaten people to get it .. then ur really really bad n evil !!"
fiost nothing comes for free . you have a price to pay fr evrything especially when it comes frm the garment
now being a human have to live on jabs booster to keep change to better mask n95 went outing .
immunity is good . though the worry is whether the new variant breaks the immunity
thanks for opening a border . i hope everybody come here safely and negative covid nineteen
"this is what happens when you rush to open up , discriminate the unvaccinated , risking more lives . back to square one . we should cancel the vaccinated travel lane , once it infiltrates , its hard to eradicate ."
ah shit here we go again ….
"variants ? spikes ? oh no , well when china had and has those but it didn t stop peoples action party from letting them in freely ."
still open to united kingdom wow
"ease restriction within the country , close down flights from new variant countries , its that easy"
hk closed like hell still the virus sneaked in
this vaccination has no data or what so ever .
let ’ s roll the red carpet to welcome the south african variants into the lion city since we are so hospitable and liberal to extend vaccinated travel lane to more countries .
"within the in - cubation period , that s where everything falls apart . mind manipulation maneuver singaporeans . these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
let t welcome also virus arrive
or let ’ s just shut down the economy and lose our jobs . maybe that works better for you ?
"bryan wang yeap , you can shut down your life and then you can go work in hell . good for all your buddies are there as everyone will agree with you ."
angel s not sure if you got malaysia point . anyway
bryan wang maybe you don ’ t understand what you are talking about and what you will be getting !
"rs lin do you think that opening the economy will really benefit the common people ? don ’ t you know that even before the pandemic , how many singaporeans in this country have been infected with the present system ? guess who are the people who really still having their time of their lives even during the pandemic ? what is really happening right now is called karma !"
"angel s in philippines , there are people who live on trash . you are too comfortable to know and probably feel too entitled"
"rs lin ignorance to the core ! don ’ t worried , you will soon learn what is singapore really is ! it is called karma !"
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
rs lin you poor soul ! you will learn soon . not everyone can make things come true ! let ’ s find out soon !
angel s how soon is soon ? still flirting with sins angel ?
"rs lin shame shall be upon those who lives in ignorance ! soon ! very soon ! it is so unfortunate that one never knows what he gets into with such arrogance ! even with the virus , one still never learns ! sad . be patient . sooner than you think ."
rs lin papies out in full force ! can see why one needs to be on the ground for so long !!!!rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
rs lin told you to wait already . so impatient for karma to deliver ! maybe tonight ?
bryan wang the answer is a big no !
"aren t they trying to push the responsibilities of paying and testing to singaporeans while they continue to open up and benefitting the rich , their cronies companies and the airport . end up singaporeans risk and pay for them ?"
hopefuly not repeat these cases again . since the covid first import in from wuhan .
how many more life you incompetent peoples action party government gonna sacrifice !!!!
and what happened to living with covid ? i thought that if we all got vaccinated there would be not more problems with people bring in new variants . wait . maybe we need the 4th shot ? can the ministers please immediately make the 2nd and 3rd shot invalid and go straight to the fourth ? we need all patriots / glassloots / pa / frontliners to take the 4th now before the new variant arrives .

today t halt the economy and our lives everytime there is a mutation of the covid flu virus . can we please open up and follow thru with the plan of living with covid ?
"shadostorm and what is your point ? every day we assess risk when we cross a street so we avoid being hit by a car . daily life is a risk assessment ... cars , trains , airplanes ... we don t need a totalitarian government to control united states ."
vtl to and from south africa please !
why not ? it will come here eventually like delta . let it come sooner to get some immunity .
should quickly bar travellers from hong kong too
no problem lah the world is linked and inter connected
congrats to kean yew for defeating the current world no . one . good luck going all the way in the final three rounds .

"if the fear of the new coronavirus variant comes true , many nations may have to reintroduce the economically painful lockdown restrictions ."
singapore authority must immediately acts to stops all visitors that had been to seven countries ofsouth africa . also must ban singapore citzens to south africa will bring back new deadly south africa corona virus variant that causes major disaster to singapore community . singapore authority must implement more control measures to prevent the deadly variant corona virus from south africa to enter singapore . singapore authority must always immediately ban all visit south africa during certain duration and some visitors might not tell the truth that had visited south africa or throw away old visiting recording and get a new document that didn t shown that the visitors had been to south africa . singapore authority must never never be complacency that testing will able to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa and must have ways to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa .
because they are most easily to be fooled .
"趙子龍 wumao are easier fooled than singaporeans , since their access to information is blocked : p"
what careful safeguards ? we are still importing cases from who knows where ? how sure is the minister that the african variants won ’ t creep into our society like the delta probably causing thousands more cases and hundreds more deaths ?
you already gave up peoples lives lol . what a fake concern
the biggest risk of opening up fully is --- opening up for new virus variants .
besides giving up singaporean life ... our jobs our future and our pride too ...
chew sean where is the a b c bone skull ?
"fiost please do not give flippant replies . there are people struggling in their lives , jobs , etc . you do not see their pain and anguish . i can see you are quite heartless but i am not sure whether you are a scumbag ."
side by side ???? safely reopening with new variants
safely reopening singapore is a contradiction in terms . it s a given . the question is : how long do we have before we get a new variant that makes vaccination useless ? food for thought .
this new ones is the one which make vaccination useless
"des chan your existing post is already very unpleasant so i strongly advise you to refrain from showing an open - up t do it , des ."
vaccination is already useless
yes . i agree with you strongly at this point .
there s nothing to fear . the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant . more mutations better .
your boosters are already obsolete
even at europe countries increased covid19 especially england !
are these new variants introduced by the smart virus itself or some ....????
"be prepare for your 4th booster , new variant is coming in soon , the old variant welcomes it gladly !!"
fark their booster bs ...
"the risk is now highest ever ; the butterfly effect . unmistakably , the covid curve is no longer flattened but gone into overdrive and hit above one thousand cases ."
hopefully the pharmas will be able to quickly manufacture a proper vaccine for this variant
how many years are we going to do this ?
it is not how many years we are going to do this . it is not we who are doing this . it is something thrust upon humankind and what “ we ” are doing are to try our best to rise up to the challenge despite the flaws and weaknesses that we have . that is what “ we ” should and are going to do .
is that alex karp in the thumbnail ?? shall buy pltr tonight …
"for those fully vaccinate , it is naive and dumb to think you guys are risk free from dying . at best , it merely lower the risk . as total infected number increases , the risk increases accordingly ."
must be from lions
"is the new variant from s . africa , like mu which is reported to bypass the spike protein defences which most of our vax are jabbed with .."
it has over fifty mutations and feared to bypass vaccine defenses .
new variants . singapore s covid direction will be expected to tax our already exhausted health care people . hope the govt are prepared .
"don t worry . the govt got enough money from pfizer . in business , nothing is free . if something is free , you are the product ."
"new s . a . variant has thirty mutations and fears of vaccine evasions . cases detected in s . a . , botswana and in a passenger in hong kong who arrived from s . a ."
there s nothing to fear . the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant . more mutations better .
"read carefully what those msm like reuters say : obviously , the blame is on the unvaccinated again ! its all because of this unvaccinated young woman blah .. blah .. blah . and within seconds , millions of such messages would be spread across the world by the msm ."
sir . thanksgiving .
viral load for vaccinated isn t reduced mrna is a just a lousy crappy flu jab
"woofwoofchs out of thirty-two mutations in its spike protein , ten are in the binding domain .. those that attach to the ace2 receptor of the cell - an indication of high transmission and infection characteristic . the delta had only two binders in its spike . there are lots of material on the net to read up ."
jo marko another concoction of mr fauci experiment ?
"in s korea , eight hundred people had to wait for twenty-four hours for a bed in hospital . that s what living with covid means in singapore ."
african lion got the new variant
lock for what ?
looks like cb for residents is on the horizon
"icu or critical cases is a percentage of total infected . regardless of fully vaccinated , single vaccinated and unvaccinated its still a percentage of total infected in each category . death rate will definite increases as total infected shoot up . is someone out to destroy singapore ?"
here we go again ....
round and round and round --- we go again
every country will get it . sharing with one another
"please go ahead with the kid s immunisation as fast as it is possible . the dosage of the biontech is one / three of the adult dosage . if it is true there is no other change - which should not , otherwise it needed again all three phases of clinical testing - please evaluate , if diluting here in singapore is possible ."
see how this goes ? every year a new scary variant around the corner . no one seems to care that singapore s all because excess death rate does not show any signs of a health care crisis whatsoever . they can keep this narrative going forever . this virus is gonna mutate forever .
"minister iswaran , hope you have the tools ready , having spore learnt hard lessons , last 2yrs .. mtf on hand .."
hong kong is very closed . now have this variant . why ?

living with the virus is wrong . it is a breeding ground for mutants . who said
ttkoh123 that ve been looking forward to teenage mutant ninja turtles since forever !
"ttkoh123 everybody knows one .) virus mutation has not stopped two .) existing vaccines are not effective in preventing infection , critical condition and death three .) effective medication is not available . only rumored medication ivermectin ( denial by authority ). given such conditions , they choose to open up and live with virus . now they raised concern !!! thats strange and puzzling !!!!"
"des chan rather than to complain , which everyone with half a brain can do , any positive suggestions to provide that doesn ’ t result in tanking our economy and the livelihood of the common singaporean ?"
"clearly , covid nineteen is predominantly spread by fully vaccinated . deliberate opening up travel lanes is intended to push the total infected number to a new height , putting singaporeans on unnecessary risk . that is an irresponsible and selfish act that need to be condemn ."
bryan wang complain ? to yr pea brain everything is complain !!!
"​ des chan lol everyone that has a brain knows existing vaccines has proven to be effective . data have been provided to you many times and you called it fake . to me , this is more strange and puzzling ."
"des chan spoon feed you with data again =) but too bad your pea brain can t process it . well , hope other people that viewed this can . over the past seven days , the number of fully vaccinated and non - fully vaccinated cases who are critically I shall / I wI shall / I will in the icu are at zero . five and four . five per one hundred , zero population respectively . over the same period , the number of fully vaccinated and non - fully vaccinated cases who died are zero . two and zero . five per one hundred , zero population respectively . among seniors aged sixty and above , the number of fully vaccinated and non - fully vaccinated cases who are critically I shall / I wI shall / I will in the icu are one . six and forty-one . eight respectively . the number of fully vaccinated and non - fully vaccinated seniors who died are zero . one and five . five respectively ."
des chan lol that the best you got ? pathetic
money is the god . it will grant protection . hopefully we can pay the price down the road .
"bochapliao thanks , they r just released to bark brainlessly . not worth our time"
"bochapliao lol you must be one if his antivax friends . at least i have a brain , you guys don t have one"
there s no such thing as safely opening singapore ... either you do it while considering our health and safety or without . period .
hk closed very tightly . it still came
"fiost simple . you knock , they open ."
new restrictions have been placed on travellers from several african countries by the ministry of health ( moh ) amid reports of a potentially more contagious variant of the covid - nineteen virus circulating in that region .
be prepared for the inevitable . south africa variant will come like how delta did .
dun worry lah .... since our mts ... are so elite and smart ... they always r the best leaders in this world ... but i disappointed lol
"what s this , 4th time already"
"vincecarlo mrna was developed for initial covid nineteen , not variant d . thats why vaccines is not working !!!"
there s nothing to fear . delta variant is nonsense . the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant . more variants the better .
delta came direct from india . already it is in hong kong .
sarcasm from the replies does help to provide an avenue to vent the frustrations we are feeling now . hopefully you guys feel better after venting
"whether we like it or not , it will come here eventually . again mtf is to be blamed i suppose . we can t reason no more"
"rs lin that say nothing becos none is virus experts ,,,, better than those self procliam virus handling expert"

s m ... incidentally ; singapore ramping up vaccine manufacturing capacity – [ channel news asia 5jun2020 before election ].
"besides banning the seven aficians countries , countries that open to the seven countries should be banned too ."
"yes please . banning based on historical travels is very ineffective . a person that has never traveled to the seven african countries , but infected by a peer that has traveled to the african countries is a loophole and opens a big vulnerability to singapore . fix this lousy travel restriction that has been put in place dear mts !"
exactly right . a traveller returning from egypt brought the virus back to belgium . mtf however is more concerned abt opening up to as many countries as possible and restoring its global travel hub status . have vaccination will travel . money matters more than lives .
"haha , lockdown lah . hong kong very closed . what happened ?"
omicron will arrv sooner than expected . source - yahoo twenty-seven nov twenty-one
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face - to - face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october .
"so , let total infected children is eleven , three hundred and thirty-eight numbers"
"the safest is safety by avoidance , for example no face to face mtp session while gates are opened for enterprise businesses ?"
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine . it s simply illogical in the context of citizens life - safeties . single party is unwise and dangerous .
why the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening ? why are we relying on inaccurate numbers ?
"prof teo on the nineteen nov two thousand and twenty-one said , but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate , i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources , because at this stage , the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening , given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore , many people who are infected will not be tested with pcr test to confirm , and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers . and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection , it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community . and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly , we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require icu care ."
"basing on the revelation , i think either the miw is too complacent at the expense of citizens ’ life - safeties , or they are only focusing on business and enrichment for a handful of people ."

we waste so much time n money maintaining a department of anti - scammer goons that tells you to take care of yourself !!!! a simple effective solution is passing a law that scamming against singaporean is a death sentence for scammers of any nationals scamming from any country and our most intelligent government with organise an anti - scammers unit that will travel to scammer ’ s home country to either arrest them or just terminate them right there ! and notify the world through united nations of our law !
now is the opposite . you don s when scammers hijacked the highest seat of power .
no government should dictate what kind of treatment or who do we seek treatment . these vaccine makers are all owned by the same group of shareholders .

discarded masks everywhere … maybe that ’ s how the virus spreads . thanks to masks indeed !
singapore famous for roti prata policy ..
percentage of death due to covid . is norm . like old age and accident or cancer terminal stage ..

endemic or pandemic now ???
"maybe if we wear mask long enough , a flap of skin will form over our mouth and nose … this is the dawn of a new type of homo sapien . the mask prototype , no nose no mouth only eyes and ears ."
besides who wants to take picture with the mask on ?!! not me i ’ ll look like a sicko !!!
the mask mandate has taught me to be kinder to malaysia dogs . we have to mask up just like we have to leash our dogs when we go out but i envy malaysia dogs … at least they don ’ t have to wear masks .
finally the authority now know whose travellers they can trust in complying with covid - nineteen protocol .
u need to let dogs wear mask too ..... any living thing that breathe .......... need wear it ....... ah bo tio fineeeeeeeeee ....... many experts miss out this !

"can we just admit that the mmtf have been fooled by pfizer / moderna / etc ? from eighty % vaccination to return to normal , we slowly lost the battle as they put their faith in an experimental drug with no long term safety data . don t forget how they never highlight the risks . only benefits ."
"president of singapore have no political power other than being a figurehead . it t know about this ..... if you want to reform , run for the primer ."
wen hui wong your comment has nothing to do with what i said . here s the question you need to ask : are the vaccines the only thing that can reduce severity of disease ?
"demonthatgotlordkeith yes you see so many singaporeans eating and shopping despite the high number of case , thats because most infection are mild in vacccinated individuals and nobody cares about covid anymore because covid is not a threat anymore in vaccinated individuals"
demonthatgotlordkeith do you want to be treated like a criminal and an outcast by eighty - ninety % of the vax population if you are not / am not vaxxed and boostered ?
wen hui wong your statement is not entirely true . it s happening in singapore ( which honestly is nothing to write home about ) entirely to the jabs is incorrect .
wen hui wong the fact that you think it ve been fooled all this while . eighty-five % fully vaccinated and still cannot return to normal . let that sink in before you type your next ib response .
"demonthatgotlordkeith you are totally lame . why don t you just come out and say you are anti - vaccine , anti - mask and anti - lockdown during the pandemic ? your are being cowardly . if that is what your talking about just say it ."
it pore govt . thumbs_upthumbs_up
"competent ? if they were really competent and implement early treatment like ron de santis in florida , we d have gone back to normal by last year . get your head out of their ass ."
stop sucking up in the comments pls anzia
clown ong
i also wonder if the mask mandate caused more people to chain - smoke or pick up smoking cos they get to drop their masks when they take a puff . a much needed break ! so one vice led to another .
"you kidding ? there are healthier ways to take a mask break , eg . exercise or even dine in allows you to take off the mask ."
totally ridiculous and no link . if ppl wanted to smoke they do not need to hav to use covid / masks as a reason to do so .
"true enough . when people want to take a break from that damn mask forcing upon them , they would subconsciously seek all reason to remove it . i would simply remove it when i am outside their boundary ."
i wonder if there will a new mental disorder developing from this pandemic - maskuphobia ( the extreme fear of wearing masks ) or unmaskuphobia ( the extreme fear of not wearing masks ). either way it ’ s driving united states nuts !
purpose is for ceca . foreigners always first priority .
"its endtimes too for buddhists , awaiting arrival of lord maitreya . many churches , mosques and temples have been vaxxxed ! what has / what is left are the bibles and sutras , when they are gone , lord cometh . you too , with your lord jesus , sir ."

sixty-one % voted for circus_tentclown_face
yeah we are . ny times wrote an article about singapore saying our govt got . embarrassing .
"so when can we get rid of safe entry app ? serves no purpose other than to monitor our movements . was needed last year , but pointless now as vaxxed and unvaxxed get covid and can just stay home for three days . why not at least make it so no mask is needed when outside , like the rest of the world . singapore want the record for longest mask wearing ?"
forcing boosters on people is unfair and unethical . people received their vaccinations . and you are flagging them . that seems unreasonable .
exponential curve + opening up wider = ?????? is somebody out to destroy singapore ?
"if you have over twenty , zero cases a day without decisions about their own safety to themselves ."
let ’ s wait for a couple of weeks . it rises to three digits . sometimes it ’ s like saying leave peoples decisions to themselves on the road and let them drive as fast as they want .
"firefox rocks yes . and how many car crashes do you get in singapore ? this government is addicted to power . we re setting a very dangerous precedent by continuing restrictions and mandates when they have long become counterproductive . twenty , zero cases a day and no healthcare emergency . if you do some math .. the only reason covid is still a pandemic in singapore , is because of the restrictions ."
absolute power corrupts absolutely
"so when no one is within malaysia eyesight , i can opt not to put on the mask ?"
"des chan just relax , don t need to open wide at all ."
"20k per day , seven days = 140k , ten weeks = one . 4m , most of the population assuming it will double soon ."
is it compulsory ? doctor doctor : ask your government ?
let everyone get it on purpose so we re not biologically feasible to survive on this planet . singapore should have its own crispr trials if it really wants to improve life expectancy .
"there could be one hundred - two hundred fatalities everyday , but if they t be reported . how many people died of heart failure , stroke , heart inflammation etc everyday ? only the funeral parlor operators know ."
"if you still need a booster after being fully vaccinated , and still need to get tested after being fully vaccinated , and still need to wear a mask after being fully vaccinated , and still get hospitalized after being fully vaccinated ... it s probably time you admitted that you have been fully conned ."
good reminder to all who are still asleep .
"yawn .. other countries have already opened up but our mainstream media is not reporting . isn ’ t that truly living with the virus ? btw , i hope ong ye kung ’ s art test is accurate .. he sounds a little sick ."

they say doctors and nurses wear masks so they must work but we are not doctors and nurses ! we are regular folks so stop acting like one ! give united states our humanity back !
totally agree with you . we need to gather all those like minded people like the canadian truckers in freedom convoy two thousand and twenty-two .
"in spite of the mask mandate , cases are still sky high … they say that ’ s because people are not wearing their masks properly … what about the flip side which is masks simply do not work ! think !"
that just proves that masks should not be forced upon the public at large but restricted only to healthcare frontliners .

"no worries , singapore only have that many people ... soon all will get it and done"
actually true
last week our company asked united states to return to office . after a week we found out that two of our colleague are covid positive now some of united states are sick and positive . is there an sanction for these companies that seems doing trial and error if its safe to go back to work and risking our health ?
yah its better to work from home by default rather than back to office all sick and cannot work .
singapore authority and health science authority must never never think that the omicron corona virus not very dangerous but if the delta corona virus will to combined will be delta crom will be very threatening to more human lives loss and more death will rise and health care will be overwhelmed . singapore authority and health science authority must immediately acts to prevent the delta and omicron corona virus to combined to spread in the community .

"ivermectin not dead rolling_on_the_floor_laughing. actually the main concern for united states was the healthcare capacity . after two years , we have found that natural immunity wins the race as it has always been . if the healthcare capacity is a concern , why not encourage and re - educate united states on how to boost our natural immunity ? and leave the vaccines to the vulnerable ( which is a minuscule minority )? rather than hantam all of united states assuming everyone is vulnerable ? the other day i saw a forwarded whatsapp message addressed by dr . v balakrishnan , saying we need to get infected to gain natural immune response . from layman to dr , we don ’ t need to get infected to gain immune response . we need exposure . just being exposed is enough to stimulate antibody and t cell response . the health ministries around the world have brushed aside vaers . this shows they do not know what is happening on the ground level and they don ’ t care . there are always steps to verify the vaers reports . i hope that whatsapp msg wasn ’ t really from dr balakrishnan as it convey lack of immunology knowledge ."

zhd1987e malaysia whole house got infected with covid recently . the rest of the family are vaccinated except me . guess what ? malaysia symptoms are the least among united states and i recovered the fastest . natural immunity malaysia friend .
"cs tan like everyone else who wish to stay out of the jab , i thought one way is to seek out the legal loophole to get myself infected and upload malaysia data . but no matter how hard i try to get it from malaysia infected son , nothing happens . for ordinary people with normal healthy immune system this just prove how mother nature take care of itself ."
"jamil m good for you ! however , not every unvaccinated person will recover the same way as you . if the vaccine is really a cover - up , then government would launch an investigation to why there is abnormally high case counts ."
"jamil m absolutely agree . this is the same experience i gathered from friends who had bot vaccinated and unvaccinated in the same household . malaysia son got infected with omicron but i won t considered it very mild . yet he is only fully vaccinated one month ago . according to all the moh scientific data , the pfizer antibodies supposedly still very high . so all those moh data cannot be rely upon ."
ini macham mati no proper treatment in hosp
"scrap one rule , implement three rules . mtf is mad"
call united states to stay home recovery to reduce infected peoples into hospital . because they can t continue stay in hotel if infected and they home is not in singapore .
"hope d mtf not surprise by d numbers face_with_tears_of_joy sure go up lah , all get it because of home isolation face_with_symbols_on_mouth. you get your problem .face_screaming_in_fearface_with_symbols_on_mouthface_with_symbols_on_mouthface_with_symbols_on_mouth now still try slowly to get numbers goes higher face_screaming_in_fearface_with_symbols_on_mouthfolded_hands"
root because analysis = destroy your cousin ccp govt in china who create this global issue .
"it will never end . there will be more variants and all , but its unlikely we will enter another lockdown like senario"
never mind can compete with malaysia
"malaysia covid cases today at record breaking twenty-seven , eight hundred and thirty-one but only ninety-three cases are serious , so also no need to worry la as long as vaccinated and boosted ."
why need to compete ? sounds really foolish to compete on some fraudulent statistics based on fraudulent test kit dictated by fraudulent politicians .
they are paid to talk with no strong prevention except blaming the locals when infection rate on the rise . can t wait for next ge .
"despite the economic downturn , i m so happy . i have been earning $ sixty , zero returns from malaysia $ seven , zero investment every 13days ."
"well said , obsolutely true . tis is their priority .."

ya right .... keeemok nyo scammers
"only $ sixty , zero ? i am earning $ 60billion per hr"
still have singaporean expect government to ease restrictions at present moment ?
palm trees will call it conspiracy theory !!
poke n poke we ’ ve agreed that vaccination against covid - nineteen won ’ t be mandatory
when are we going to open up one hundred % since covid cases are raising everyday with restrictions ?
this wave infections will takes four - six weeks to come down
they literally syringesyringe the infectious agents into their body . who to blame ?
"singapore cases will hit fifty , zero by end of this week or one hundred , zero by end of next week"
"imagine only one % need to be hospitalised . just for two consecutive weeks , what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system ? no kidding , just a repeat of new york two thousand and twenty ."
perfect stop nonsense rubbish mrna jabs
i think you are obviously missing out the fact that there is only 6m people in singapore ...
i guess the plan is get everyone infected first then achieve herd immunity . then won ’ t need the continuous jabs which is costing the government .
today seventeen february there are sixty-five cremations scheduled in just mandai crematorium alone . those who died today will only be cremated after several days of funeral procession .
"twenty-four thousand, two hundred and twenty death in two thousand and twenty-one not trying to scare everyone but just to reflect what had happened to the past and now . with our choo - choo train being piloted by smart leadership .... this year would be very tough also ."
"carol catherine i believe there will be no herd immunity against this virus from malaysia observations in florida , united states ... i know of people who had sever symptoms and hospitalized for a week . they should have had very strong immunity , but became reinfected with omicron though symptoms were mild . being infected means it gets transmitted . wearing n95 mask properly may , may help deter transmission , but only in public spaces , not amoung family living in the same house ."
real life experience is real science . brought to you from sglifeofunvaxxed thought to share to let everyone knows malaysia conditions are not anything worse as they claimed to be because i am unjabbed . so have no fear . truth would prevail and the ( false ) narratives would eventually crumble .
d . kinzie there is actually no way to avoid this virus unless one or one ’ s family members don ’ t leave the house at all . i actually don ’ t believe anyone can have immunity from omicron since it reinfects the recovered too .
"what a joke , here are the achievements ;. united states cdc re - classifies singapore as level four : covid - nineteen destination [ aka : very high level of infection ]."
palm trees anti christ in person !!
ttkoh123 see man i too do not trust peoples action party but when you just copy and paste the same comment everyday and comment on ur own comment it kinds of make you look desperate for attention .
we all shell not vasinate
"umm … should stay at home as much as possible ! if still do normal activities , good luck . if they get covid hopefully they get mild symptoms . if this turns to worse ones , serve them right ."
"imagine if you have other disease like heart disease and you get covid - nineteen , it could be very serious and not a mild condition . this is what living with covid - nineteen means , people with disease will suffer like hell ."
with so many clot shots administered this is precisely the reason they re expanding the bed capacity . the moh is fully aware since the case of the sixteen up boy who suffered myocarditis .
"imagine only one % need to be hospitalised . just for two consecutive weeks , what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system ? no kidding , just a repeat of new york two thousand and twenty ."
zero . two % infection fatality rate ( ifr ) of covid . ebola had ninety % ifr . still afraid of a psychological warfare virus ?
"winter lantern wake up . these people are lives , your relative , fellow singaporean . they are not mere statistics . if you think money is more important than lives , you are on the wrong path . if you get covid - nineteen and on hospital bed , your comment will be very different ."
one case is one too many - remember how we got to this dire situation ? you guys never learn your lessons do you ?
petrus romanus ironic how you say we are not mere statistics when the mmtf are using our bodies as kpi on an experimental drug with no long term safety data .
petrus romanus “ one death is a tragedy ; one million deaths is a statistic ” is one of stalin s most famous quotes . the answer based on past two years event is obviously the experimental vaccine .
yes agree with you petrus ... that s what i worrying ! crying_face

today seventeen february there are sixty-five cremations scheduled in just mandai crematorium alone . those who died today will only be cremated after several days of funeral procession .
let s ease all measures and lives our life as per normal ...
no need worry la ... you guys say its endemic .. live with it maaahh you guys say ... do not worry laaaa ....
"ya lo , spread only mah , heard immunity mah , covid naive mah . strong one survive , weak one die mah , more elder die loh . more up lorry loh . maybe one day those who approved of the decision to open up their elders oso up lorry loh ."
only stupid people believe that living with covid - nineteen can work . live with covid - nineteen means everyone will be infected by covid - nineteen and get sick or even die and have long term implication .
"singapore can not close border forever . i think we will all kena covid at some point . it is only a matter of time . covid nineteen is going to be as common as influenza , not only in singapore , but all over the world . we will have to learn to live with it ."
politician are being scam by pharmaceutical companies to believe that living with covid - nineteen can work and now citizen have to keep taking covid - nineteen jabs .
stop the scammers from keep scamming the people by exposing them .
these days when peoples action party says i want to laugh .
"the panademic has shown that even a big of experts working together cannot resolve this , not to mention one country government"
"in another words , children and elderly are relegated to another make - shift facilities other than the proper hospital care . please respect our elderly better ."
"its fk all now ....... i theory . there will be more blood , there will be more anger . we are on ur side and we will do something next election ."
honesty no more business as usual . this clearly indicate money greed putting citizen life at risk . must vote wisely

"lai fong chan have you heard / read about mu ? well in malaysia book , only the loki variant is welcome haha ……"

in two thousand and twenty-five they will tell you they control the covid well in 2021with low death rate . so please vote for them to help you better ...face_with_tears_of_joy
"the pharmaceutical companies have take over , they want you to be sick forever because they want to make money and be in power forever . like high blood pressure medicine , you have to keep taking covid - nineteen vaccine jabs . cancer , hiv , diabetes and many other diseases , pharmaceutical companies cure almost nothing . they make it a chronic disease like high blood pressure and make money out of it for the long term ."
"record high of nineteen , four hundred and twenty new covid cases in s s up two thousand and twenty-five ?"
"vtl without quarantine , without supervised art test , no need pcr confirmation , open up for imports and worse seven years of formula one .??? reckless gambling , reckless spending ."
"for example if $ 8k income per month , pay almost ~ $ eighty-four , two hundred and forty . zero of gst tax in five years . money so dearly for the children and for retirement . do your own maths . if this is not example of failures or fake promises , what is ?"
"these days , trust cannot be simply granted . what do you think ?"
"what a joke , here are the achievements ;. united states cdc re - classifies singapore as level four : covid - nineteen destination [ aka : very high level of infection ]."

"thanks for sharing your experiences traveling during covid , its very different than traveling before and we need all the advices ."
"chinese test kits ,,, ethylene oxide is used as a pesticide and a sterilizing agent . the ability of ethylene oxide to damage dna makes it an effective sterilizing agent but also accounts for its cancer - causing activity . war crimes ."
crazy .... never done this with the bird flu or the ebola
some muppet is clearly making lots of money
i think i m blaming the whole singapore covid .
maybe singapore govt should follow the germany way instead of having roti prata new normal .
"question : i ve got a sinovac vaccine and if i wanted to travel to germany and i know its not under the recommended vaccine list , how will i enter or what is the possible way or solution in entering germany ?"
do you need a covid vaccine and quarantine if you are coming from the united states ?
to compare germany with a snot like singapore is silly !
"now the cases are getting higher you still dare to travel , not malaysia fault if you get covid - nineteen"
oh stop being so dramatic steven ! : p
very helpful information for those wanting to travel soon !
woohoo mauritius !
when open bangladesh border now bangladesh corona less ready
"presenter stay in landed ?, mediacorp has a really high pay :)"
so what happens if you test positive for the flight back ?
the worry of being infected with covid and can t come back to singapore without ur love ones with you would be a real concern for any traveller . congratz the team for coming back safely !
"all the tracking , restrictions and procedures - germans seem to love this kind of crap ."
"it sure looks wonderful when most of united states like myself love travelling but there s a price to pay . look at the additional charges to pay for this and that , you get frighten by it ."
haha so now traveling is for the rich ass people .
"so , what will happen if the pcr test return as positive before the flight back to singapore ? what will be the advice from the german health authority ? put on quarantine or hospitalize ? steve never ask leh .."
i think govt just wants to avoid this question because it will turn many people away
"for travelling to the united states , depending on the state self quarantine is not mandatory there , so there s kind of a half - vaccinated travel lane ."
may i know if i would need to get quarantine in singapore back from germany if i have not stayed more than twenty-one days in germany ?
"as long as you were in either germany or singapore for twenty-one days before you board the plane , you do not need to serve a quarantine . but this is only for specific vaccinated travel lane flights , not all flights are the same ."
"steven , is the freshly brewed oktoberfest beer stronger in ur opinion ? = d"
fresh beer always taste better ! but i don s that much stronger ... i did not have enough to find out !
when you are ready to invest one billion usd the borders will be open for you .
so the cameraman also travelled to germany ??
no we hired a local crew since they would know the area better
when steven got shocked that the test only takes thirty-five mins .. and the guy at the counter just rolls his eyes at his over - the - top fake surprised reaction .. cos we all know that was just a way for the german guy to explain how they don t need a lab now cos of advanced tech .
"ha ha ... don t tell everyone our secret ! rolling_on_the_floor_laughing but honestly when i first heard about it , i was truly surprised to know it could be done that fast !"
"germany vaccination sixty %, malaysia vaccination rate also sixty % already . when can allow vaccinated travel lane for malaysia ? its been closed for two years and its really depressing . eighty-two % vaccinated , ninety-eight % asymptomatic / mild symptom , yet two thousand and twenty-one is like another year of two thousand and twenty only . why we r still not able to move on ?"
"agreed . a bit upset that vaccinated travel lane with germany when united states is also over sixty % plus in malaysia county in san mateo , northern california its eighty % vaccinated for people over twelve . and most of united states are waiting for a booster shot . so this high on vaccinated travelers seems like a way countries are recouping tourism dollars they lost for people desperate to travel for family reasons etc ."
you should ask your government when can open .
"jane muses singapore totally got no intention to open vaccinated travel lane with malaysia . malaysia only bother about business travel lane . i m really depressed . living day by day , no purpose , no meaning . n they seem like want to lock singapore - johor bahru border forever"
too troublesome to travel during the pandemic . i expect most airline companies to be bankrupt by the end
"wow , five pcrs in total . the cheapest i could find on google in singapore costs $ one hundred and twenty-eight . including gst , that t think spending $ seven hundred just on testing is worth it ."
s $$$$$$$
"steve , you spent less than twenty-one days in germany , but still entitled for vaccinated travel lane and no quarantine upon back to singapore ?"
thats no problem . you have to be in germany or singapore the last twenty-one days .
hope china and pakistan get on the vaccinated travel lane list
anyone know how i can get covid nineteen vaccine certificate for malaysia thirteen - year - old daughter ?
"australia , new zealand , korea please . really wish to travel again . singapore too hot and humid . japan only if their infected cases drop drastically ."
"sinovac is chinese vaccine . its not recognised by mot western countries . so if you fly to australia , you will still need ot be vaccinated or be in isolation for two weeks and you will be treated as unvaccinated"
last time go airport earlier to submit tax refund cos of the queue in some airports .... think next time got queue for pcr test when more people start to travel
very informative program . just what i m looking for . thank you .
only riches can afford to travel at this time
not for sinovac right - discrimination
for show lol
daniel lim actually singapore is hot and humid the whole year except perhaps the rainy days . i used to travel abroad to enjoy the cooler weather and the natural landscape . really miss all these .
kevin khoo please prepare for arrival
"it is all about business man , you have to pay more and more that said ..... you pay for quarantine , you pay for medicine , you pay for extra transportation , you pay extra price tickets , you pay extra taxes ...... etc . they want to return what they lost because of pandemic loses ."
"thanks for the info , i was wondering for sure . it s a better way to streamline travel"
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
you then pathetic
s $$$$$$$$$$$$$
"showing people happily travelling , while jobs are being lost and fully vaccinated people are squeezing out rooms for self - isolation in hdb ... thanks to our dear leeders"
totally giving up to eliminate the number of cases ? still allow entry and exits ?
stop whining
when singapore do not open borders and people do not get to travel more jobs will be lose !!! narrow minded people !!!
"why can people visit denmark where the covid cases are climbing , instead of indonesia where the cases are dropping ?"
not intetested to travel now ......red_exclamation_markred_exclamation_mark no thanks
five covid test . such a awful sensation . no … i ’ ll wait until next year .
s $$$$$$$$$$
as steven grows older he is showing the true talent that he is ... this goes to show that hard work pays and eventually your time to shine will come .
it should be obvious we can not eliminate the number of cases for covid nineteen . we have to learn to live with covid nineteen just like we live with influenza .
"germany sounds more logical and clear with green , yellow , red status vs flip flop ong ye kung"
if i were him i would go to some other country possibly non europe right now .
"at least now they use some brain with the name , calling it travel lane , cos a lane is long , change from calling a bubble , wait keep popping ."
emotional episode ... brought me to tears grinning_squinting_face
i find it absolutely stupid that vaccinated singaporeans have to take two more tests on day three seven ! germany is not afraid of united states going there but we are being treated like foreigners in our own country !
"face_with_tears_of_joy bro , we having 2k cases just yesterday , you want infected sgreans from overseas to add to the hospitalised body count ar"

"traveling during the pandemic - you have a new tv show , steven !"
"the plaque took eight years while spanish flu two years . it ’ s not impossible to neutralize a pandemic with proper containment . everyone must do their part , just like how wu lien - teh create his task force to contain the previous plague ."
it is so political driven that europe does not recognised who authorised vaccine unless it is made by western pharmaceutical companies . at the same time western countries are hoarding majority of their own vacacines without donating or selling to other part of the world ! such selfish people as always !
"thanks for doing this channel news asia , kudos to steve for taking one for the team and sharing your experience with united states !"
"thanks for sharing your experiences and insights , steven and the channel news asia team ! malaysia wife and i are traveling to germany next monday"
do share your experience and cost !
gouthamgs s will do !
have fun ! hopefully the weather is good !
have fun and stay safe :)
great video content . good to let singaporeans be aware of what is available in terms of locations and money wise . there are always choices available . question is ; which choice are you looking at ?
lucky man for him while enjoying and get paid too .
meanwhile in the philippines the incompetent government is forcing people to wear facemask and faceshield ....
cool its like a preview of future travelling
good information
good thing the recovered are treated similarly as the vaccinated .
that is the best vaccine
anybody knows which travel insurance provider mentioned in the video and which steven has selected ?
we had a special company policy since this was a work trip . best to check around as the policies keep changing .
looks like you re still on intermittent fasting !? OK_handmedium_skin_toneOK_handmedium_skin_tone
definitely worth it if company paid
will be funny if he tested positive when departing from germany
this is so cool . also good product placement :)
"that ’ s way very expensive especially the pcr tests . i travelled to europe last month but didn ’ t go through so much hassles . paid only € forty-nine for pcr test on malaysia return flight . upon landing in dubai , the pcr is free for all ( tourists and residents ) and result came in under three . five hours ."
"doubt the vaccine I had / I would , testing and screening system will go away anytime soon , too much money to be made . countries relying on tourism ( not talking about those in the europe or others ) will have to look at alternative ways to grow their economies . the stagnation of travel and tourism might be a good thing overall ."
"橘_デル_tachibana ya ? ， look around you . protests all over the world against masks , vacinnes , covid nineteen rules and regulations . in singapore , many people still go to malls , outside . many people does not live their lives with containment ."
playing with fire fire for all travellers out there . you are selfish mofo .
"how stupid are vax people ? so stupid , they ’ re still in mask and doing six feet when their sheep master already poison them ."
"um no , it t want to meet crazy antivaxxers thx , you all think nebulising hydrogen peroxide is defeating the govt ."
"lai fong chan yes , we cannot eliminate covid because of ppl like you"
brunei is boring ... beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
"as a singaporean living in germany Germany, need to highlight about pcr test price in airport and in cities . results within 90mins cost € one hundred and ninety-nine , within 6hrs cost € one hundred and thirty-nine , within 12hrs cost € ninety-nine and within 24hrs cost € sixty-nine . steven used the 35mins one in airport when is most expensive € two hundred and forty ."
oao ! pricey !
"steven is sponsored by media corp ( i guess ) so why not ? if for me , it s way too pricey to even make any sense at all ."
wong francis cheapest way to save money is to stay at home unless it is a must ... i am most willing to pay this price to fly back to visit old aged parents in singapore Singapore. they worth every cents .
let t put a price tag on it . you have the best reason in the world to take this trip .
"meaning , student with say a sgd three thousand to bagpack cmi"
"thanks for the info , mate . i am planning a trip to germany soon in october this year . wunderbar !"

"het gets a pcr test prior the flight , another pcr upon arrival and two more after that . I had / I would rather stay home then !"
"hahaha me too , i literally laughed out loud . time stamp should be"
great and fun job you got
thanks steve for sacrificing your september holidays so that we have quality content !
"wow . it s really expensive to travel during the pandemic , which cost $ 2k excluding accommodation and food . and to tolerate getting swabbed for so many times . guess probably it would be more worthwhile to travel after the pandemic but will have to wait a longgggg time ."
"well , pre covid the flight alone was 2k . so same difference ."
"i agree ... price tag aside , i don t think i can stand being stuffed through malaysia nose multiple times"
would be hilarious if they keep sending steven to new countries under the vaccinated travel lane scheme and this turns into a travel series
next stop : brunei - the most happening place in southeast asia .
that ’ ll probably happen in less than a week
a is for airborne
i d look fwd to that . i hv always enjoyed his programs
great content idea for channel news asia ! it will be eye opening also for everyone to see how travel is like in those countries too .
"marianne morris right now , i think most of united states wouldn ’ t mind travelling anywhere ."
south korea next !
amazing ! so envious ! hopefully new routes open up smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes
i hope so too !
wrong priorities
do this at your own peril . rest assured they will find out . the result will not be pretty .
there will be consequences !
"honestly , quite enjoy steven ve always wanted to go and gorge myself on roast pork and beer and be sick for like three days from too much food and waay too much booze .."
"as singaporean living in germany ; rbg , the big octoberfest in münich is cancelled again this year . roast pork - not really malaysia palate ( too greasy n fattening ) winking_face_with_tonguezany_face grill chicken is a better option for this fest nerd_face. enjoy grinning_facegrinning_facegrinning_face"
unfortunately it was cancelled ... we were there the week before it was meant to start . but i still had malaysia fair share of sausages and beer ! smiling_face
how much he spend from his overall trip all the test accommodation and etc
i hate the nasal swab ... i d rather they extract blood !
"so travelling overseas in this time and age is more for the wealthy who can spend bucketloads to pay for tests , potential quarantining when you come back etc . travelling is never going to be the same ever again . i don t they be used as proof of + ve /- ve tests ? if they are not reliable and trustable for international travel , then have they just been released to increase public trust in the local system of testing ?"
thats sq for you - bloodsuckers airline .

"politicians , royalty and billionaires ( and other uber rich ) are travelling freely now . only the plebs have to go through one thousand and one procedures ."
"totally agree . priority should be to investigate fully vaccinated cases and yet suffered sudden heart attack . the sixty-seven - year - old former winger , who was a household name to many singaporeans in the 1970s , is understood to be in critical condition at sengkang general hospital ."
"thank you so much for this helpful video ! from the additional logistics of covid tastings , cost , and risk of infection , looks like two thousand and twenty-two will be another domestic travel year . and an opportunity to save $$$$!"
good for him .. his life is soooooo normal
for those few days it was ! i m sure singapore will get there too !
i thought pf said it is highly effective against infection ? then why does spore need to conduct three pcr tests for returning singaporeans ? isn ?
"it ’ s just ensuring that you ’ re definitely not infected ? there ’ s no correlation between the two . face_with_tears_of_joy if you ’ re coming back from a high - risk country , you don ’ t want to start an outbreak , because you may be the outlier who got infected , even if you got vaccinated ."
"it protects against dying from infection , not getting or spreading the infection ."
"renae davies it is related . didn t pfize said their vaccine is ninety-five % effective against infection ? go read their published marketing results . it is against infection and not hospitalization , get this clear ."
yeah ... we just want to be extra sure here in sg
some people just can t get over what was in the past . face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy highly effective was the original strain . now is delta variant
"smallgouphakka it was not effective in the first place at ninety-five %, that was false marketing . both alpha and delta variants have breakthrough cases ."
"alex tong yes , five % ineffective"
alex tong where did your data come from ?
thanks for watching ... guess it all depends on how badly you want to travel ! the tests actually were not too bad .
"not for singaporeans finally have a chance to return singapore to visit our love one . malaysia beloved singapore Singapore, here i come !"
steven chia this vaccinated travel lane seems more suitable for urgent business trip and those visiting family in the motherland but with all this rather strict health checking i personally do not recommend anyone to travel there for leisure cos its constraining the mind to be free and at ease but still this documentary is on point in details and informative but apparently you look really worried most of the time but still its an excellent effort .
"cbcb simi , checking your health is degrading ? if you don t seem like someone with a long lifespan other ppl would want ."
"our hospitals are running out of beds , virus spreading like wild fire , moh hotline not able to get through when we call and still wanna let people in ?"
"steven chia hi steven , may i know which insurance company you used for the travel insurance ?"
"oh god , so many swab tests to do in singapore if you were to leave and come back to singapore . in this video , they say that germany has saliva test . how effective is this saliva test ?"
i think is definitely not as effective as a proper pcr nose and throat swab test . that s why even the kits we buy ourselves is the swab type .
it is a full pcr test .
"wong francis but honestly , based on the video based on his trip to germany and back to singapore , he had to take five pcr swab tests in total . to me , five swab tests , for a single trip to ensure a safe journey to all singaporeans going to vaccinated travel lane countries , is a lot for me to handle . malaysia nose would be very assaulted and insulted at the same time although i have done it once before and tested negative luckily ...anguished_face"
"nigel morais with the new heightened alert due to recent surge , it only makes sense for singaporean to visit germany not the other way round . with dining only for two , it s hard to spend more than five days . with such a long flight , many hurdles to jump , it really makes no sense ."
"so technically at the moment , travelling is for people that have buckets of money to spend . test here test there .... a price to pay ... for now ...."
"unless you are a diplomat , celebrity , sports star , actor , minister etc . you are supposed to spend the rest of your life inside home making zoom calls with your boss and friends , and watching youtube videos to satisfy travel urge . get used to it ."
forever unless you comply and get vaxxed
"out of all the place he went to germany the country i left for good , exactly for those reason ."
economy first people last . efpl .
steven chia cheating la
that is what is called a normal beer . ours come in test tubes face_with_hand_over_mouth
"steven chia after working holidays , maybe can be vegan for a week . see how challeng is it in singapore . beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"
steven chia face_with_tears_of_joy i guess still can t get drunk on the job
"woah , the cost and test itself is quite high , just like the thailand holiday scheme . unless you really need to be reunited with your closed ones overseas . the whole process can be anxiety - inducing nerve wrecking . especially when waiting for the results ."
"there are just too many false positives in the tests . moreover , if the test is conducted by the authorities themselves when they supply the kit , or observe the kit out of your own sight , they can easily fudge the result when they just do not like you , because of your skin colour , or if you carry the passport etc . in other words , they will take your money to conduct the test , but they have full control of the results , and the outcomes to use it against you . they can send people to compulsory fourteen days quarantine ( where the quarantine is paid for by the traveller himself ) based on a semi - accurate test conducted by themselves , in order to help the hotels that have been converted to quarantine facilities ( such as conrad singapore )"
"just malaysia thinking , if those airplanes still stop flying the engines will stop working soon . then it come with big $$$ for replacement ."
$ six hundred just in pcr tests ? i rather get covid .

"kal well not necessarily . last week , i went to spain , malaysia vaccine card was enough to get into schengen so i didn s free here in the states ) before heading there . when i had to fly back to the united states , i had to do a simple antigen test which was thirty-five euros . instead of spending six hundred euros , i only spent thirty-five euros during malaysia week in europe ."
"henry song i think it differs from each country . looking at singapore , coming back is ridiculously expensive ."
"kal we have vaccines . i don t die from covid if they are healthy , i know for fact singaporeans have a healthy lifestyle ."

high quality content . keep it up .
super love steve chia and his series ! keep it coming !
very useful information . thumbs_upthumbs_up
the whole of singapore is envious right now

why ?? be patient till everything is fine --- then you travel as much as you liked thumbs_upgrinning_facethumbs_up
this is a very insightful and informative documentary as i ’ m planning to go to germany this december for holidays .
"that is too much work ( and too many tests ) for a single trip . maybe this crisis is giving united states a lesson , to slow down and enjoy the solitude or the company of our immediate family , relatives , friends and the simple , local destinations ."
j . d . what a shame .
"yes , you should !"
next life that s not how it works .
"carl jay i have no doubt in your strength and resilience but not many people can bear having their business shut down for more than three months or even six , with mortgages to pay and inter - generational families to feed ."

"mindtwister , the thing is ; as a business operator and business minded , knowledge of global trends from geopolitics to potential pandemics as well as other unforeseeable circumstances that can be expected to happen , should have been anticipated , expected , preempted so that diversifying and switching of industry can be done at a drop of a hat sustaining negligible or recoverable losses . i foresee a future of largely online based businesses ."
"my friend who needs to go to china to stay w bf ? face_with_tears_of_joy simisai sinovac still effective , got inject better than unvaxxed as most doctors will tell you . twenty % in singapore still unvaxxed leh , you go drag them , leave malaysia friend alone"
"who han that depends on individual country if they want to “ recognized ” a vaccine . this programmer shows that sinovac is not recognized in germany . astraz is still the most widely recognized vaccine , followed by pfizer , modena ... etc"
i do love to travel too .. soon on god s will
"yes , the total costs maybe even higher if you failed the pdt prior to return to singapore . quarantine costs in germany may not one hundred % covered by travel insurance ."
happiest when i saw mask off !!
can we get steve infected with covid ? preferably with the delta variant so he can share with united states his experience with home recovery ? it would greatly help singaporeans with their anxiety with home recovery as we move towards endemic living .

xiao ... put in strict control on singapore resident n lift up all control on all high risks countries just because of $$$... if you believed what you believed then pls lift up control on families house visit n group dinning ... many of them did not lived in the same household ... you hv to know small hdb not like big house where you hv all fam mem stayed together ... be more down to earth when you flip yr policies .
why must lift up family house visit when cases still high ? why cannot whatsap or face time family member ?
booster shots is not a solution . sorry sir . use the real facts

"in addition to the data of vaccinated who succumbed to covid - nineteen , another data of interest would be how many , if any , vaccinated persons have re - contracted covid and gotten seriously I shall / I will . also , if fully vaccinated status expires a year and two weeks after the second shot , how about those who have taken booster shots ?"
"if i do not have young chikdren thenni do not care what ever they wanna do . but malaysia three kids are still under twelve . and i am not ready for them to get vaccinated ( vaccine must be test and trial years before it safe for consume ) let alone forever booster shot . you all act like will die if cannot travel outside . who is the selfish one now ? and before shoot me up fyi me hb , parents we are all vaccinated as reluctant as i am . if i die at least only we die . but i am not ready malaysia children to be vacinated . think about the repercussions in later years ."
why urged everyone to reduce social gathering when you want to open up borders for more tourists ... just let everyone to live their lives as per normal lah ...

bravo to the task force and the options for vaccinated travel lane are getting more varied . a calibrated approach is the way to go . a responsible and capable govt is the key .
well said . they are on top of the situation . they know what they are doing

"how about those sandboxes in thailand and vietnam ? right now even though these countries allow united states to go there quarantine free , singaporeans still need to face a lengthy quarantine upon return . can the authority do something for these ?"

"vincecarlo face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy the two on trial sandboxes now are separate from the main land of thailand and vietnam . majority of the islanders had been vaccinated . true , people from all over the world can enter these islands but only vaccinated people can enter . therefore you need to measure the recovery index of these islands separate from the main countries they belonged to . if the vision is to be living with endemic now , then what ’ s the concern with establishing vaccinated travel lane with these sandboxes where the only potential risk of contacts are with vaccinated travellers from other countries ?"

"ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand , phils ?"
"its good news for those who want to travel , even for me but I am afraid it will be short - lived . cases in singapore is still in thousands and they act as if its less than ten . remember the ktv spike , they place united states in phase two but now cases is thousands they open borders for travel ??"
"that is the right thing , bo bian . if wait until zero pax , then two thousand and fifty also not fixed ."
meowth no need until zero . even less than ten good enough besides no need to wait two thousand and fifty then cases go to zero . previously singapore also got zero cases lol
"inker man well , then we would expect to be in lockdown forever , this virus will not be going away ."
xiutian zheng that i already know . malaysia issue here is the numbers not whether the virus is going away nor not . seriously you guys need to wake up
"ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand , phils ?"
inker man how would you go about doing it ? how would you suggest to reduce the number ? without lockdown .
"meowth well you are digressing too far . let us start with having the right mindset 1st . i know you guys desperately want to travel , so do i but let us address the elephant in the room 1st which is infected cases is in thousands but vaccinated travel lane is in talks and going to happen . does not makes sense right ? if people cannot see that do not start talking about solutions when the problem itself they cannot identify"
vincecarlo I am surprised mlysia is lower than singapore . I am expecting them to do worse since they lack good system
"with eighty percent of the population vaccinated for covid - nineteen , attention is now moving towards booster shots in view of the waning protection over time . should we use the same or different vaccine ? just remember what the great scientist albert einstein said : ."
vincecarlo mrna vaccines does not work . look at singapore we know already . sinopharm according to the rankings by gci have good recovery rate
"i assume the gov assess this base on risk . they probably think the probability for vaccinated getting infected or die from it are lower compare to unvaccinated . and considering the total vaccinated citizens in singapore so far , it s tolerable enough for them to open up without killing the majority people . but unfortunate for the minority who could have underlying medical issue or in a poorer health condition . top management will want the whole singapore to survive without caring too much on smaller problems if the bigger one can be resolved . just malaysia assumption ."
"ah yi i agree with you , though i think the only flaws is that govt place too much trust on the efficiency of the vaccines which undermines the reason to take calculated risk for vaccinated travel lane . but this is another topic to discuss , i do not want to digress too far . its a mixed feelings for this vaccinated travel lane , relief and concern"
inker man so much for water_buffalopile_of_poo efficacy of mrna jabs
"inker man well , actually , thousand of cases a day isn t a lot . unfortunately . take flu for example , the current symptoms for ninety % of the folks is similar to that of flu . flu has also killed and hospitalized many folks . therefore , based on your theory , thousands of cases is not very significant . - unfortunately . 2ndly , no i am not desperate to travel . let say you are right , then how should the case be controlled ? without vaccinated travel lane ."
"meowth not a lot is based on your perspective only . compared to a small nation like singapore , thousands is a lot . you cannot compare flu to covid in this case , flu is not a pandemic that closed down borders and shook the world . you asking me about solutions when singapore overpaid ministers cannot solve them ? rolling_on_the_floor_laughing what i can give is suggestions and malaysia point - of - view . 1stly the vaccines needs to be right 1st . our vaccines is questionable and controversial thus explains why singapore is in this predicament right now . get the vaccines right then everything will fall into place and eventually it will be really safe to open borders for everyone"
"inker man spanish flu was a pandemic . unfortunately , three thousand / six million is a very small %, based on population size and not ‘ small ’. if i say three thousand eat chicken rice a day out of six mil , thats very little right ? i just want to hear opinion actually because many has claimed to want this fix but not providing a suggestion , so just curious how each would manage this . would be better to have solution proposal and a vague goal . as for vaccine , seems like its working to me , ninety-eight % mild symptoms , thats very effective ."
"meowth spanish flu was a pandemic , covid is a pandemic . so what has / what is your point ? again three thousand / six million is based on your own perspective besides , covid is not just in singapore only , its worldwide unlike spanish flu . as for vaccines , do try different sources to know the credibility of the vaccines . do not just rely on mainstream media . doctors , scientists who has no link to govt or media have better credibility to say about vaccines than those who are afraid to lose their jobs . try dr peter mccullough for instance"
meowth the stone was already cast when temasek bought a stake in pfizer .
"jp phua interesting . so you would go for zero covid approach ? but if all other countries not doing it , are we going to not let people in / out quarantine forever ? bcos all you need is one case to create two , two to four and so on . whereas pcr , i thought the same , but that requires more than paper and manpower . you need the equipment and trained swabbers and testers . what if one test is not accurate and how many rounds are required ? possible but not as easy ."
"meowth art is less accurate than pcr . why then are we wasting our time and resources . i do malaysia own art and i s not that every country is rushing to buy pcr testing equipment . if china can do it in a few days for a city of eleven million , we should be able to do it . no ?"
jp phua if its three thousand more deaths compared to non covid . then its no good .
"jp phua we should avoid characterising people here . i do not agree with what gov is doing too . china has resources .. we do not , where are you going to house six million samples ? if we do it for five days that is thirty mil samples . let me ask you a very simple question . if we isolate ourselves . we lose investors , company leaves , singaporean lose jobs , thirty % unemployment . cannot afford food . how ?"
"jp phua the point is not chicken rice , it is the statistic . regardless . you may still think its very high . that s your tolerance ."
meowth five % is high for me . but not high enough for you ?
ridiculous . govt allow unvaccinated from hong kong and taiwan to come in and no need to serve shn . allowed to roam around and mingle with locals . but sbs ask their vaccinated bus captain to lunch alone and not to mingle .
meowth don t worry .
meowth still cannot connect the dots ?
"jp phua i have had three . thing is , i am not trying to find fault with a singular point of view . we can have many suggestions but how to go about doing it is totally another story . i can say , lock down for one mth , let the virus die off . will it ? live in isolation for a month . no it won ten pax a now . faster the spread , faster back to normalcy . no need for tt , no need for all other stuff ."
"inker man you said flu is not pandemic . zero . five % is small ... go to any statistic calculation and zero . five % is not even considered . well within error zone . so believing in a two - three outspoken source is more credible . got it . like kim jong un . or should we look at scientific papers with high citation . anyway in terms of vaccine , its your own call right ?"
"meowth in terms of vaccines , its not about whether its malaysia call or not . I am advising you to be open - minded and not have a narrow vision when it comes to information . you seems to be one of those people who only read mainstream media . try not to get confused"
meowth did i say i want permanent isolation ? did i mention norway ? stop putting words in malaysia mouth . all i want is for the mmtf to stop their deception and lies . opening up to foreigners without quarantine when we re not coming because of their travel advisory blacklisting united states ?
meowth and you re the only fool that uses infections per day vs population as a measurement on how a country performs . how stupid can one get ?
"jp phua you are missing malaysia point . not important . there is actually no way to keep the case low to achieve reopening . you can have low case but once you open up , it s going to rise again ."
"inker man actually , i am open to the vaccine being unsafe , unreliable . i am just reading data and using microbiology scientific evident to evaluate the conclusion . whereas you are the one who are not willing to accept . and i am narrow minded ? :)"
"inker man actually , i agree with the prata flipping part . actually , if you read back on the chat . i just wanted to point out a few facts and looking for suggestions . i did not characterized anyone ."
"jp phua try to read up on how herd immunity work ! zero . five % is low infection . one hundred times more is still not high enough for herd immunity . i know you re smart , you will understand how microbiology works !"
boosters malaysia foot
inker man i think vaccine works . was open to vaccine being unsafe . do not think its unsafe .
"inker man nono . go to sciencedirect , nature , reliable journals ."
"hooray , good for singapore !thumbs_up"
a great decision by our mtf . they handle it well . step by step we are getting there
you already have 1000s of cases . who cares just open
so end of the story singapore despite tax payers paying premium salary to leaders but the outcome is same as every third world country which is can ’ t evade death when infected at least to minimal . recent fatality numbers in malaysia opinion shows the management has failed !
"how can they extend vaccinated travel lane and sacrifice our health , well being and lives for money . it is a selfish act , undemocratic and cruel .pouting_facepouting_facepouting_face"

how about citizens who return for less than a week ? does it mean such individuals cannot come home ?
boba fett why ? because not everyone is like you with so much disposable time and no administrative tasks back home .
ace shadow then do not return just stay put and do face timing or virtual meeting from overseas if cannot commit longer .
"boba fett who are you to suggest that ? it is none of your business to try and impose on others . are you going to be the one paying for malaysia ongoing bills of expenditure ? stop being an online nuisance . every citizen has their needs and after all , this is their home country . :)"
"boba fett you have wild imaginations indeed . in malaysia question , i was asking about the rule that was not mentioned , nor clarified and there is no reason for you to get so excited . since when did i not respect the rules ? i guess you have nothing better to do and enjoy seeking attention . this should be malaysia final advise and response to you , go do something meaningful and get a life ."
ace shadow speak for yourself .
ace shadow if you do not know the difference between thinking and mindset flip flopping then can you please keep facing the wall .
"boba fett suit yourself . om mani padme hom . bye , the pathetic one , go face the wall ."
ace shadow do not om here and om there just to hide your silllly billly first comments about returning home less than a week cos its sensesless .
boba fett pest off ! malaysia comment is none of your business .
"can the audio be better , this is not the first time that i had to max malaysia speakers but still not getting clarity ."

so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !

covid are smarter than what experts think these days . i am worried .
"the vaccine business is making big bucks . i bet after the 2nd or third booster shots , our government will start to charge united states for subsequent booster shots . a new revenue of income from its own citizens"
"requiring booster shots this early indicates how accurate the is of these mrna experiments . who is artificially liking these videos ? the previous videos had higher downvote to upvote ratio , this is not organic ."
"they can open up germany to come here direct . i just curious , why can t let unvaccinated people dine in restaurant for two . unvaccinated people also healthy right ?"
"germany nine bordering countries , do you think they will stay in germany twenty-one days without leaving the country , can we trust they declaration they come to singapore ?"
"allow to open borders for a groups of tourists in , but singapore only allowed five person gathering and dine in !!! so are the tourists oso cap at the group of five too ??? since tourists are allow to come in big groups so when we are able to go out or dine in groups of eight ???"
vaccination below twelve soon ?? no thanks ... i ll pass ...

the vaccinated ones are the ones with variants .
let s count down how long it will take for singapore to go back to phase two heightened alert .
so many cases cannot trace still want to open
only fools like peoples action party ministers believe vaccines can keep the virus at bay ...
so tourist welfare more important than singaporeans welfare ? or singaporean citizens can be bullied and pushed around and shoved down our throats ! so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !

human with common sense do learn . but those who lost common sense is like drunkard who are intoxicated . similarly supposedly highly qualified people in thier respective field maybe overwhelmed by arrogance which they re not aware of is also similar . ecv19c is a good example .

if you don t wish to spread to others ...
"the people here mainly lives in flats and in such close proximity like pigeon holes . they also share lifts . if they allow active covid cases to stay home during this stage , then there ’ s chance of spread because of the proximity , also through formites ."
"actually , with the emergence of the delta variant in other countries that are heavily vaccinated , shouldn t they slow down the reopening ?"
"the govt is prep united states to live with covid , as it and restrictions will continue to be revised every now and then ."
so are you sure delta is not there in germany and brunei ? how it differentiate with an indian fully vaccinated traveller ? please tell me who is at higher side ?
than please stay home and do not come
su su noone knows why border can not be open for vaccinated people . they do not have anything to argue .
india might be faking their data . there could be much more deltas in india which they never declared . i think it ’ ll be safer not to let anyone who have been india or any south asia countries in for the past thirty-one days .
so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !
"andy sim who on the earth not faking the data ? do you know every damn country in the world where virus created havoc has atleast one variant . however , in united states , why there is no variant ? in india , now business is as usual . india is a open society unlike china . media is powerful . nothing govt can hide . not much covid patients r in hospitals ."
"in malaysia opinion , singapore government should require all travellers from overseas including hong kong and macau , to also have a negative pcr pre - departure test result seventy-two hours before getting on a flight to singapore , in addition to on - arrival test . if not , some travellers could be covid - nineteen positive , and actively spreading the virus to others on the plane and in our airport . thus endangering the life of fellow passengers , staff and others ."
"hope ministers see your comment . we don t mind people travelling outta singapore , we r more worried about the incoming ones ."
"a year ago we hoping for a vaccine to end this pandemic , now after vaccines , come up with delta variant ... so what variant next ? echo variant ?, foxtrot variant ? golf variant ? hotel variant up until zulu variant ? then booster ? booster after booster after booster after booster ? end up after so many injection then got so many lobang on your arm and covid still smiling and say yeeeaaah baby I am here to stay ... bring it on .. but still I am praying that all will get better .... i miss malaysia family"

"dear ministers , tbh i am very skeptical about the vaccines . please be honest with united states the numbers and details of people who are affected adversely by the vaccines , those that you have issue compensation , and is that all . now you want our children to be vaccinated as well ? please review ur figures .."
"was the two compensation cases paid they survived covid , right ?"
pay out ~ one / four million is already admittance to vaccine because of severe illness yeah rite
if they want to tell the truth they will use absolute risk reduction of zero . seven % efficacy . absolute risk reduction is used for chicken pox and other vaccines .
"if they ve the slightest display of honesty , no singaporean would ever be involved in such an experimental trial at national level without inform consent ."

hope our health care resources can take the next hit .
"our medical facilities are advanced and adequate to cater to local population , but with the re - opening starting next month , not sure how severe the surge in covid will be with the influx of tourists ."
lol . using big words like heterologous and homologous . just say mixed vaccine and singular vaccine . using flamboyant words show you are not close to the commoners and wants to sync with them . still dare to says they are with the people .
"if you cannot convince , confuse face_with_tears_of_joy"

so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !
"nope , no thanks thirty-two . 3m infections"
"please stay home , we already hv too many cases"
allow air travel from many countries but social gathering or dine in at f b still pegged at five pax max . i am lost .
"economy their priority , not residents ."
we too thinking_face
"ya , allowing air travel is really risky . we kept our cases low within our population , and the spike was usually due to influx of tourists . even with dining of limited pax , do not think gonna help ."
pls pls open borders to riau . esp batam bintan . singapore should donate vaccine to batam and bintan . tks .
what about opening of indian border ?
no please . we are still in the mess open borders with india created .
"nope , no thanks thirty-two . 3m infections"
just stay home thanks ! we already have enough cases here

covid has eaten your brain dude .
konchok trinley yup false security
when novovax ? soon i hope as option for booster .
"wong kok kiong once who approves can get it possibly via private hospitals . timeline maybe who will approve it six to eight weeks from now , maybe less . united states cdc approval maybe next year jan / feb two thousand and twenty-two ."
"novovax if effective , china will not have a bug out break over more than ten ciities , which almost ninety-five % of its people are vaccinated with two jab months ago ...."
"walter wong ??? novavax is a united states corp , that a protein sub unit vaccine , not inactivated / killed virus vaccine . as of now nobody has approve it for use under eua . its under serious consideration for approval by the united states cdc , its very likely to be approved but very late two thousand and twenty-one or very early two thousand and twenty-two . the corporate has not seek any regulatory approval from china prc for use there . so don t know what your talking about ."
"in short , they do not know what is the 3rd vaccines . its trial and error , effectively those taking the booster shot r lab guinea pigs ."
once jabbed no stopping !!
"god s amazing grace yup , endless . pharmaceutical companies revenue is guaranteed"
"i just don ’ t understand why are all these people up there talking , while the specialists experts just typing on keyboards ."
"a nation of vaccinculas .. a probable scenario when a jab is needed every six months , very much making everyone a , requiring daily medication . i really do not know if that is a solution ."
"des chan darpa and moderna have plants set up here . we and the world should ask why are the vaccines free ? lky said so do not expect freebies have no strings attached , especially from the messy will - fighting family who ruled united states to eternity . who pays whose salaries ? the covid team is very well fed and very fat indeed during pandemic ?"
I am not a horse vaccine not working keeps jab 4th 5th icu

when will we open up ourselves like our european counterparts ...? those unvaccinated employees are denied work at their workplaces ... the same goes for the self employed ... not only are they being denied work at their workplaces which some do solely depend on for their living ... many are also facing restrictions for months ... if they are to be released from restrictions ... release them ... they are not prisoners ... it is not right to have their livelihoods denied off them when they don t take their jabs ... many do suffer from depressions and other forms of sicknesses related to being depressed ... be it mentally or physically plus body aches other than covid nineteen ... it has been going on for a long time and i do believe it is not a good situation too ...
"don t know what the true intentions of our government , but from all the reports i have seen , vaccination does not protect you against covid . there are people who kena covid positive even after taking two doses of vaccination . the government still think he can fool united states when there are people who died after taking two doses of the vaccination ."
"what is the daily infection rate in s pore from fourteen feb to nineteen feb , two thousand and twenty-two ?"
"“ our government cares more for the economy than it ’ s people ”. why so , how so ? are the people independent of the economy ? when the economy collapses it ’ s the people who suffer when they lose their jobs . go ahead and do a simple search ! what happens to people in countries where the economy has collapsed ? a country has so many things to worry about . can anyone else who ’ s complaining step up and do a better job taking all things into consideration ? closing schools , sure ! what happens when kids have to stay at home ? yes , someone will have to stay at home ( instead of working ). can parents handle that ? or are they already pulling their hair a month after watching their kids ?"
i hearsay . read from somewhere . that someone in that circle had difficulty finding job outside .
"the symptoms i had were just a normal cough symptoms with sore throat . don ’ t worry and it ’ s nothing serious at all . however , the grey area is how people can ensure if they fully recovered from covid since there are many cases where art shows negative but pcr shows still positive . now pcr to ensure you are fully recovered is more important than pcr to ensure you test positive ."
this panel is as useless as the vaccine is
"i ask malaysia oversea friends about our situation , apparently oversea seems to do something similar . it could be just united states catching up with what oversea people are doing . we re just late in that matter of making this discussion ."
"in the meantime , the two thousand and twenty-two air show just like two thousand and twenty continues ."
five seconds into the video and i am already done with them
they are going to make a lot of people into huge problems . these is a bunch of blood sucker .
from daily eight hundred stable until yesterday twenty-four thousand
why nursing home suspended they need family to come . its unfair .
just close school lah the covid and omicron cases increasing . more students and teachers getting affected
after nine mins ... i stop listening ... and shake malaysia head .. let united states and see what happen in the next few weeks .
please don t try to manipulate people mind .
now fully vacci also easy easy omicron thks
"omicorn is our booster shots , hahaha ,,, one over , they will introduce you the fourth shot and give another name for new strain"
singapore ministers very easy to do . everytime has things just tell everyone this is the new normal . when singaporeans citizens fatality increases significantly they will continue to tell united states this is the new normal and live with it ? ignoring precious life ’ s of singaporean whom trusted them is incorrigible !
thanks that country given so number face_with_medical_mask gone few year
how many deaths per day ?
ccp latest invention = bioweapon
not anti vaccination but anti vaccine science and big pharma bullshit . why do you need medication when you are not sick . current science is money making business . we are no more patients . we became clients and customers to the medical industry .

ok well done just follow
2yrs smm restrictions after nine % gst whole life
so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !
wow what a great forecast and preventive measures with reliable risk assessment well done !.
why is pcr test so expensive in singapore as compared to other countries around the world ? honest question ....
pure business .
aiyah ! not expensive lah win win solution lah
expensive ? $ one hundred and twenty-five vs rm one hundred and fifty . are you doing currency exchange ?
tua pui kia sing $ one hundred and twenty-five is expensive . its only rm one hundred and fifty in malaysia ?
ho ching global covid university small price difference i can understand but its almost three times more compared to many other countries .
ninety mins of ministers wanking each other and giving no solutions to tackle covid . rather watch a match that has five goals of the same time than this
ry it t compare pineapple with apple . rm150 is expensive for local .
tua pui kia and you think $ one hundred and twenty-five is not expensive for local singaporeans ? money is money regardless of where you are from the effectiveness of a pcr test in malaysia is still the same as in singapore so why such a big price difference ? seems like you are the one comparing pineapples and apples and who cares what brand we use ? all we want is whether its positive or negative ?
cannot afford do not come here . you are not a locust right ...
tua pui kia got negative on art multiple time despite having positive on pcr n ur here saying why people don ’ t trust art
"ocswoodlands high rental ? oh btw cost of living in singapore is no . one in asia last year . do you know how ? yeah profit margins are high so richman go richer and we , forever slave ."
a c come where ? born and bred in singapore . i am asking about price difference not about whether i can afford or not ?
ho ching global covid university you not temasek . for sure its not a living being .
endemic or pandemic ?
no value add ! waste of tax payers money ! so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds ? all because most will be dead as the new normal ? shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay . we expect more than that ! everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly !

"in warning to you . s ., covid rates soar after denmark lifts all restrictions . [ ref : yahoo ] denmark became the first major nation to lift the last of its pandemic restrictions . but since , its number of cases and deaths have skyrocketed ."
"did you check covid numbers of denmark ? or follow msm read and repeat ? if not yet , check denmark covid cases on your own ... and the fact now is , no more covid rules and restriction ..... on the 1st feb forty-five , three hundred and sixty-six new cases weekly average forty-three , three hundred and nine ... on the 18th feb thirty-five , six hundred and fifty-eight new cases and weekly average thirty-nine , one hundred and ninety cases"
"record high of nineteen , four hundred and twenty new covid cases in s"
"in two thousand and twenty-one , i lost all trust in them ; what else ?"
these days when peoples action party says i want to laugh .
"in another words , children and elderly are relegated to another make - shift facilities other than the proper hospital care . please respect our elderly better ."
so if social distancing then don ’ t need mask ah ?
singaporean are more sick of the measures than the virus ... let s ease all measures and lives our life as per normal ....
yes sick and tired of this measures ! mttf should change mindset its endemic just move on and remove all restrictions
"already very high number of cases , bring back zero covid - nineteen policy . actions now not sleep again and let cases shoot up ."
means don ’ t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
"kenneth mak already said there is no concrete plan for 4th dosage . anyway , we have procured the covid treatment pill . that should be enough … barring a new variant ."
u turn will come soon ....
one also haven ’ t taken rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
the plan is five
calvink will have new variant . no worry s .
"asd rion not just new variant but new viral species . it ’ s natural biology to have pandemics . just like there will always be diseases , isn ’ t that true ?"
hopefully new zealand will be added soon . these are beautiful vast countries for travelling .
how come not showing the number of vaccinated death anymore ? what is moh hiding ?
gotta thank peoples action party for making the country a super spreader .
still can t go au for holiday loudly_crying_face
number to hit ten thousand
more cases above five thousand and many more deaths and we are talking opening borders like nobody s business !
do you just not want to go places and think about the expats ( foreigners ) that live here that cannot go home . and why are you celebrating people r dying there . do you want it to happen here
"so , big deal ? the number of deaths from covid in singapore backyard is something more even bigger deal to deal with ."
so rush to open . should have at least wait for everyone to take up 3rd shot first then see how .
"many people worldwide are protesting hard against vaccine mandates n vaccine passports . many doctors , nurses , firefighters , police , military soldiers , teachers etc are striking and walking out of their jobs to protest the jab - or - job vaccine mandates !"
"where are all the folks gone ?.. before the new restrictions limiting dine in to only vaccinated customers in coffee shops . there was a good number of customers at these places . even with the two to a table limit . but now , if you care to notice , most coffee shops have a sparse look , while qs can be seen for take away . the same thing at the fast food outlets . the take away and delivery people far outnumber the dine in folks . this is odd , since eighty-four % of the population are vaccinated and should have no problem as dine in customers . why did the crowd thin out so abruptly ?"
because the vexsinated know they are the speedy silent super spreaders !! no to vexsin !!
god s amazing grace another explanation could be that the vaccinated percentage could be lower than stated .
maybe the high vaccinated numbers just a smoke screen .
welcome ... welcome ... everyone spent your money here ...
yes . spend your $$ for covid treatment here …
uhhh only if singapore had covid under ccontrol lol
the baby zebra looks so adorable beautiful . smiling_face_with_smiling_eyespurple_heartcherry_blossom
the problem of this singapore only $$$ is in their mind now ... moh complain that icu beds are reaching critical levels ... n straining the medical facilities n workers even witbout opening up ... so how r you going to manage if the tourist is infected after finishing their quarantine here ?
"the only problem may be , do australians want to travel to high risk country ?"
anna xin australia is like her own continent with so much natural beauty to enjoy that most of them will hardly need to travel elsewhere eg . to see blocks of pigeon holes
only government
"yes , i have been traveling in australia , where is the scenery is very beautiful , the quality of life of local residents is also very high"
it s why vaccination is necessary

many reviews about him always on youtube i think i ll trade with him . i really want to win too .
very proud of our forward looking govt . we must stay open and make more vaccinated travel lane this will protect spore s livelihoods .
yes . open more hospitals and mortuaries to match more vaccinated travel lane openings .
fiost better than reckless and brainless toads .

"petrol prices increase , vaccinated travel lane for businesses"
singaporean now need to get 3rd jab as fully vaccines ? do we implement this to oversea travellers or only apply to singaporean ? do enlighten united states .
looks like you have to regularly update your vexsination status no to vexsin !!
testing positive in overseas will be problematic and very costly . travellers need to be well prepared with $$$$ and risks .
i think got travel insurance for covid now .
sin ooi let us hope its fully covered not those that say fully covered but later find out so many hidden cost not covered .
finally some common sense from the singapore government
"iss report no fifteen / two thousand and twenty-one - long - covid management principles . version of july one , two thousand and twenty-one . we would like to hear from the govt , their responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients ."

now vaccinated travel lane has became virus travel lane ... omg ..
this is what you call living with covid . shut everything again when a new weaker variant is found . lmao
stop vaccinated travel lane air not land most viruses came thru airport first . why so gundu
"instead of having incoming travelers stay at home , wouldn t it make more sense to have them isolated away from home first , in hotels for the incubation period , in case they infect the people at home with omicron ? this was the protocol before ."
"now then suspend vaccinated travel lane , don s too late , virus already come in !! why always wait until the virus come in then government act !!! only suspend vaccinated travel lane with malaysia or the europe countries too ??"
"it is clear that omicron is already in our community . the three anytime fitness omicron cases had not travelled abroad nor were they close contacts of the confirmed omicron cases ( imported and community ). the key consideration therefore is not the detected cases so far but rather the undetected cases which we know are already present . yes the freeze on vtls are long overdue given the escalating omicron situation in many of our vaccinated travel lane partner countries , but still better late than never ."

two years more realistic .
"opening up of borders when a relatively new virus is at an onset stage is the stupidest and very wrong thing to do ! the authorities are putting the health of not just flight and ground crews at risk , but unnecessary stress on medical staff who are seriously in need of their long overdue breaks after working overtime , during the recent mass exodus and fighting hard to save patients lives . run the country with a heart and not just brains with economic growth in mind ."

i thought we supposed to open up and live with covid ? face_with_hand_over_mouth
"the all seeing eye talk is cheap . action please . we need all patriots to quickly take the boosters . and your kids and grand kids too . so that you can take the 4th shot asap . so mr all seeing , have you done your part ?"
now you say flip prata . if no action taken you say they value money over lives .
"as i said so much earlier , it is not the time to open up . so many imported cases of imported omicorn causing lea"
"causing leakage into community . see what happens now , got cluster of community omicorn"
the flip flop never end in the farmland ...
looks like singapore pm can only come from the familee . either his wife or son will be groomed for that position soon . pouting_face
hahaha coming soon 4th booster on the way for adults rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingsyringesyringesyringesyringe this is definitely some kind of experiment already
"wait for it , soon they will make it like an insulin shot . take weekly : d"
shivam singhal nah that won ’ t happen
open close open close really singapore jocking with other country
phase two
should act sooner as most of the omicorn cases are imported . now the omicorn already in singapore ... causing our citizen fear and anxiety .

some things just can t be rush .
"aiyo until now than stop selling vaccinated travel lane ticket is of people kena , see and learn from other country la ."
"close , complain . do not close also complain . knn you think you have better idea ?"
"simply because vaccines don t work against transmission of virus , not against delta and definitely not against omicron . still pushing boosters ? are they out of their mind ?"
please add philippines to green list
"明知山有虎 偏向虎山行 = 找死 。 translate : . mtf knows the dangerous omnicron variant is spreading fast and potentially can evade immunity and render vaccine useless and yet still opening up more vaccinated travel lane ??? i dun know what to say . then when omnicron reaches here and hits the economy and kills singaporeans , they will blame singaporeans for not following safety measures and causing omnicron to spread ?"
similar to opening up a cage and letting poison snakes bite you
"five hundred x more infectious no problem , just need five hundred booster shots for lrrr , ruler of the planet omicron persei eight ."
"pls also be much more vigilant with united kingdom . they have a lot f travellers with south africa . as i hear from german scientists , the thing they call omicron now is super - aggressive ."
"deadly africa variant , probably have reach singapore . singapore is opening up like there is no tomorrow . will know in two weeks time ."
no opening no tomorrow . hong kong closed very tight but they came too .
fiost hong kong two cases by far . singapore with its liberal opening will see 10x or even 100x of hong kong cases .
gov job is to protect the people lives first . not protect the money .
"if hong kong is your model country , then you must be very sad now . what does it teach united states ? no matter how closed you are , the virus can find their way in . the defense should be vaccination ."
we are hoping you go on frontline for united states since you are so patriot plus others who hang on to your words .
living with the virus is wrong . it is a breeding ground for mutants . who said
"with so many v t ls launched , omicron , like the delta , will most likely be imported by air ."
"in fact , without super - easy global mass travel , the entire pandemic would have been far not as bad . i suspect that these times are over . get used to it . changi airport ... ? - better have a different plan ."
i am sure the new african variant is impossible to enter singapore via vaccinated travel lane countries . looking forward to xmas surprises
new south africa variant on the way
heard of this before ... when china started the covid and when s turn to penetrate ...
to study medicine and scientist and how much do we need to pay ?

singapore is still okay . well managed by mtf
"yes , let united states wait for fiost to take united states out of this pandemic before you say bravo . unless we see death rates down to zero , you can clap slightly_smiling_face."
"i give up figuring out how these idiots think . with twenty-seven vtls , multiply that by twenty-seven and our reputation as a tourist hub is destroyed ."
"they detected the south african guy during quarantine . vtls , no quarantine . see how dangerous that is ? so how the hell are we to know if the sa variant has arrived in our shores ?"

"hello sir , is it possible to travel from singapore to malaysia then from malaysia to thailand and then india ??"

for transits they are not asking for any on - arrival pcr test unless it is the requirement of your final destination .
hi sir gud evng i going to india from singapore need to take pcr or not
you have to get your rt - pcr test done from india there is no on - arrival pcr test now and that has been replaced with the self - test anti - gen test
i going to india feb twenty-six i have 2dose vaccine need to take pcr test or not
no need for rt - pcr upon arrival in india . just simply to registration on the air - suvidha and upload your vaccine certificates .

india more nearer to africa and indians are almost everywhere in seven continents of the world .. so the chances of them carrying the virus is greater than indonesia .. and the current indonesian govt support peace and progress in south east asia than their previous predecessor .... imagine if no covid but indonesia not happy with spore also does not work well for united states and our economy or is it we use to this kind of peace that we take it for granted

vtl is still too cumbersome . since vaccination does not prevent infection you are likely to test pcr + ve without even knowing it as this virus is super transmissible . when this happens overseas on arrival your vacation is finished . if you come back and test positive - your job is finished . fully vaccinated does not reduce your risk of catching covid - just less likely to be hospitalised or die . fools tend to rush where angels fear to tread

"for opening of gurantine free land vaccinated travel lane , i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than fifty % of its capacity . all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings . for every private vehicles , it should only be allowed to carry not more than three paxs ( including driver will be four persons ). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated . that way , safe distancing can be maintained . should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johor bahru and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches ."
"smacks of tokenism , only flights , main passage is via land travel . not true opening !); when causeway 2link ?!"

"john five thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four yes , i agree that some chinese have no problems living under harsh conditions with the malays in malaysia . but there are many more who prefers throwing their malaysian citizenship under the bus for the sake of getting singapore pr ."

"looks like singapore is still putting family matters aside and only super concerned about economy . where is the vaccinated travel lane quarantine free for mothers and fathers to meet their children in singapore ? vaccinated travel lane must give serious thoughts to those poor family members who are fully vaccinated but yet not able to go to singapore to meet their immediate family members . selfish acts , only concerned about country personal desperate emotions of separation blues from their loved family members . this is madness , so much wait for vaccine and now with vaccination completed still so difficult . singapore must consider opening vaccinated travel lane to all countries in the world who has family members in singapore !"
not . happy . singapore political racism countery india . why
before many travelers from endya have been coming to singapore with daily imported cases so now give chance to others . the more you say bad about singapore the more singapore may close and padlock door to endya for the longest time .

"how accurate is the pcr test ? following real story speaks it all . the fifty-six - year - old has tested positive for the deadly disease seventy-eight times since two thousand and twenty and is seeking a way out of his situation , which has confined him to his home and hospitals for a total of fourteen months ."
"gladiatorgamer you t even a singaporean , btw ."

what if singaporean go overseas and get covid . will they able to come back seek treatment ?
"with 5m population , the nineteen , zero daily cases is equivalent to four . 5m in china one . 3b and it is crazy dangerous . many vulnerable folks will die . those in icu are likely kept breathing with machines and deaths are scheduled gradually to avoid public alarm . goh ct tony tan and gang are old and covid will likely kill them soon as the spread explodes ."
"there will prolly be a next wave , best thing to do is to name it ongyecron ."

"one after another , countries around the world begin to roll back the covid mandates in their countries , even israel has to give up its hope in medicines to roll back its covid mandates including the quarantine for tourists . except very few contries like those totalitarian societies china , nk , or united states or few others , people break down the self isolation to welcome tourists without bothering ask tourists any covid related questions like vaccination or checking temperature ..."

window of opportunity .
stinkapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may ( no masks no safeentry check in ) since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying_face and this is called political science nerd_face not science rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
so if social distancing then don ’ t need mask ah ?
maybe they should start testing peoples spitting whilst talking distance
hopefully other asian countries will follow singapore Singapore they leading the way in asia .
hopefully no countries in the world will lead this orwellian bs we live thru in the recent years
"most countries are in the covid nineteen level three ( high ) to level four ( very high ) range . that is why our government need to move our pandemic to the same levels with them so we can logically open up travel with these countries , mainly for economic benefits ."
"yeah , i can return without quarantine !"
what s mean vaccinated travel lane ? face_with_medical_maskbiohazard
thumbs_upthumbs_up kudos to the capable s pore govt .
"kudos to the govt , soon there will be no mask mandate for tourist / visitors . despite increasing covid cases and deaths , the govt decides to ease covid measures instead of mitigating the covid situation . it s clear that the govt does not want to lose out on global travel rebounds so increase fatality is acceptable collateral damage ."
it s follow the leader . lol
tf is non - mandatory safe distancing
most vaccinated travel lane are people who want to return to their homeland like malaysian
hi i am from bangladesh ... i can meet you ... please send your facebook I had / I would
is this restricted to singaporeans and malaysians only ??

"steven , just don t come back to infect your fellow men ."
"steven , please do a vaccinated travel lane video from melbourne to kuala lumpur , pretty please ? thank you so much ! :)"
you should have done the vaccinated travel lane travel process to south korea anyway .. i cannot find any such video on youtube yet
how is travelling on a vaccinated travel lane different than normal ? what are the pros and cons of travelling via vaccinated travel lane ?
it s interesting how both the art and pcr are significantly more expensive in singapore than in germany .. any possibility to dig into explaining what goes into the difference in test costs for singapore vs germany ?
greedy people want to make money
"seriously if you travel on holiday during a pandemic , you really need to have your head examined !!!"
"pcr test , dollar_banknotedollar_banknotedollar_banknote"
please stop all this ..
"this is not i think , it is from all burmese = bema = malaysia judgement = amargeddon"
"selling sia or promoting it , now bcos it heavily indebted . but not our live into it and be fool by it . sorry be honest with it worth it ? what if cannot and will not be able to fly back and got stuck in the air , that is the end of it . too late by than ."
"first of all , thank you steven and channel news asia for doing the german vaccinated travel lane video . it s so informative and i used it as malaysia reference prior to traveling to germany and belgium recently . yes , please do a travel series ! i am planning to visit korea next .... hope to see steven on the same flight !"
anyone from australia for any purpose can come to singapore . but not the other way round . why ? singapore low class ? so hard up meh ? unequal agreement also accept . not just australia . so many countries can suka suka come to singapore . but not vice - versa .
"with all the hassles , uncertainties of tests , and additional costs , it d rather travel within malaysia own country in malaysia and still enjoy the nature , sun , and beaches ."
"every time he comes on screen , i ll switch channel ."
"main issue is unpredictability for working adults who have to book leave with their employers . if you require quarantine prior to return flight to singapore ( you tested positive before your flight back ), not many employers will be too pleased with your absence since you would not be arriving back in singapore as planned , regardless of whether you had any control over situation ."
even open to united kingdom and europe only five % singaporean can afford to travel there
is it true that only flying sq can get quarantine free ?
"nope ... that s not true . vaccinated travel lane flights are available on other airlines too , it depends on the country"
what happens if you are unvaccinated ? are we still allowed to book tickets on singapore airlines ?
"starlite seventy-seven yes , you can . but you may have to serve quarantine in the country you visit . only those on vaccinated travel lane flights don t have to serve quarantine but they must be vaccinated"
ychong ong sq and lufthansa are the only two airlines offering vaccinated travel lane flights from germany .
steven chia hey steven ... do a vaccinated travel lane report on sq ’ s inaugural nonstop flight to vancouver lah !
"if vaccinated travel lane is a bad idea , your trip says it all ."
go to south korea pls !! would like to know how to process is there for vaccinated travel lane .
the days of budget travel are officially over . enough said .
"this doesn t affect the vaccinated travel lane as the lane is for arrivals into singapore only . as for entry to germany , as of oct twenty-three , fully vaccinated travellers from singapore can still enter germany without serving quarantine , though there are restrictions for young children . read more here ?"
channel news asia insider great clarification and next hope channel news asia can do another documentary on vaccinated travel lane to other asian countries like india pakistan brunei taiwan hong kong or china and show more footage on how steve explore several tourist attractions and find opportunity to locate and interview singaporeans who was visiting these countries at that time .
what about unvaccinated passengers are we still allowed to board singapore airlines ? what are the ramifications for the unvaxxed ?
starlite seventy-seven am unsure if unvaccinated can travel to ubin ?
why is the art in germany only cost one to one . five euros . singapore cost ard ten sing dollars . why why why .. government pls do something about this . i don t need you to give me free . i need you to bring the cost down so i can buy myself .
"cos they produce locally ? i checked with malaysia friend in united states , costs around s $ nine . fifty per kit in united states too ."
yes it s definitely worth aside from small hassle such as pcr testing or seven / eight days testing at your own expenses please do south korea for vaccinated travel lane ! because we are in the midst of finalizing the plans to travel in jan / feb two thousand and twenty-two
"ha ha ... sorry , afraid you ll have to do your own research ! grinning_squinting_face"
"if you get used to the art and pcr tests , most likely you 成龙了 ."
"where ’ d you get these bags from ? these purses are perfect , need one asap !!!! and the bag"
he needs to be updated . ha ha ha !
"still seems like somewhat of a hassle , and so many variables ."
indeed its just too mind boggling and depressing and in fact humiliating to go through all these health screening regimes so no thanks for vaccinated travel lane for leisure ever .
boba fett so it s not mandatory to get vaccinated to fly on singapore ?
even open majority of singaporean cannot afford to go united kingdom or europe face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy all want go cheap country indonesia even close border with singapore face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
thank you this was very informative
- and pcr is really not necessary for vaccinated folks . art will do actually .
"only foolish vaccinated folks in some countries are wearing masks outdoors , not the other way around ..."
are you immune like the rest of the politicians ?
no income without tourists
no uninjected peasants allowed in
"grab singapore stopped all rostered routine art testing we still strongly encourage delivery - partners to stay vigilant , do regular self testing and visit doctor when feeling unwell ."
mr x angmo boss very happy . no more rrt . thought he won . hope he contract covid n up lorry soon .
systems are looking nonsensical as this plandemic prolonged ..
"you ministers messed up big time . numerous restrictions on malaysians where risk level is low to medium . but you opened the floodgates for the indians to come in and now twenty , zero cases daily ."
"the more cases , life and travel will go back to normal sooner . or else , singapore will end up like hong kong . lee hsien loong is no curry lamb ."
the imperfect perfectionist can you compensate the suffering and death of singaporeans .
"gurmit singh no , i am not responsible to compensate for random people s lives . a modicum of reality should tell that to anyone ."
"i think the pandemic have really thought people the importance of multiple streams of income , unfortunately having a job doesn t mean security"
"dear ministers , your decisions and policies have failed and caused so much grief to singaporeans . never listened to me ."
"until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them , this drama will continue . the disease isn s all about the virus ??? person_facepalming"
oh so not for citizens but foreigners ...
what about outgoing travellers ?
our present government can do whatever they like . even when they are voted out they still can take up jobs in the government policy making job . the choice of the citizen is not taken into consideration at all . democratic of one man one vote to get the appropriate person to represent united states is taken lightly .
"whatever , anyway viruses have everywhere since we are born to this world just because of politics and business make it life more difficult just take care of our families good and safe our lives by our own way should be ok"
this govt simply wants everyone of united states to get covid . its disrupting our work and health for goodness
can we torlerate these rubbish anymore .
sincerelly yours
now is almost all omg . it is no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated people . as far as they are clean . all welcome ... it is good for our business .
it s all about control .. they will never ever let the power go .. buckel up ppl .. more clot shots are coming ..
responsible for all the death you because . murder .
means don ’ t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
"omg another new talk cock guys no knowing what is happening . one minute this and another minute that . ong ye kung , i think you need to be very sure before implementing new things . making singaporean very sick to listen to all your stupid suggestion and later put the blame on singaporean not careful and caused the cases to goes up ."
"it s not how much money you keep , but how much money you make , how hard it works for you and how many generations you keep it for ."

"just to get it . if i ´ m healthy according to the rules of back in the old days , like really going far back in history , like back to two thousand and nineteen , i can not enter singapore as a random healthy not vaccinated foreigner ? that will prevent a lot of business people to come and deal another blow to the tourism industry ."
"it all depends on what restrictions other countries have . singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia ( among others ) did , too . it creates a competition for tourist dollars , investments etc . basically , opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others , triggering a virtuous cycle . it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions . if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements , then singapore will likely follow too ."
"unvaccinated peeps are not welcome le , stay out . we reject retrds"
"19k cases yesterday and yet today simplify rules for travelers . open doors for covid - nineteen to come in is stupid , repeat the mistake is stupid , believing in peoples action party is stupidest ."
so what ?! 19k so what ?! majority are having mild symptoms ! look at our poor businesses that have suffered from this pandemic ! if we do not allow the tourists dollars to flow in how will they survive ? they will end up dying of hunger or worry whereas majority of vaxxed c + patients will not die ! guess who s the stupid boy !

marc gourde well said ! we should expel these clowns out of our society at all cost
"cases need to rise for lockdowns or travel restrictions to lose their effectiveness . so it s a reason for celebration . only a rising case number beyond control can force abandoning restrictions . examples plenty , european countries , australia , south korea , vietnam etc . i said since the beginning , the pandemic will last as long as restrictions last ."

petrus romanus thank you for verbalising malaysia thoughts .
"south africa already over omicron despite low vaccination . we r giving it to children , god bless !"
the case numbers don s treated as a common cold unless you are the singapore government are nothing but cowards .
"just a champion crushing your dream actually it might turn out that omicron has not mellow down but appear to seem so due to vaccination n natural immunity from past infection as they both appeared to hv almost the same strength in clinical data from united states , europe n israel ."
precisely what was shown in many clinical reports worldwide but not in local media .
two fake accounts ; two n five mth old fake accounts talking to ownself
"vincecarlo so tim loo , tim loo2 , justfair , rs lin all same same ...."
singapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may ( no masks no safeentry check in ) since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying_face and this is called political science nerd_face not science rolling_on_the_floor_laughing

vincecarlo people were amused by charles yeo s performance and decided to vote for the comedian .
still i not got malaysia student pass la i entered singapore on january twenty-seven i completed malaysia quarantine period and everything still ica is not give appointment for me to get malaysia student pss
i think the student pass and the quarantine are two separate issues . you might want to contact your school or mom to check on your pass status . all the best in your studies .
what s the point of taking precautions when you leave your main door wide open ? really silly policies . thumbs_downlight_skin_tone
never mind the imported cases the more important thing is that tourist dollars flow in .
"hong kong with zero covid policy , closed their door lockdown areas with covid cases . daily cases on the rise with breaking record each day . don ’ t seem to work for close door policy too !"
"summer apple well said ! and they have china as their backing , unlike us"
so many questions by commenters unanswered . i for one wanted to know if foreigners who had entered singapore are able to use the vaccinated travel lane .
"you can , but you will face the queue . rather pay ahead since it s the same price .."
we have to be an open city . livelihoods are important . no grass to eat
vincecarlo that is very good ! shows that we are one step closer to living in an endemic
"summer apple hong kong has tested its whole population twice , planning again , explaining their huge numbers . no test , no real numbers ."

( bcoz of seven hundred more deaths ? i don ’ t think so .)… good men r in - charge ?( open borders to infect the nation then open more stating that vtls r negligible as compared to vtls , don ’ t think so two .)… icu low occupancy ?( making sick ppl stay home n much further from medi needs , is this why more ppl die ?)"

what logic is that ... opening up more but no easing of restrictions !!!!
opening up brings in more tourist dollars what does the easing of restrictions bring in ?
"good thing . the more we open up , less will be the incentive of closing border . as he clearly said , when community cases rise , closing border losses its effectiveness . that is what we need to break out of restrictions and travel bans ."
"triloler thirty-nine if too much restrictions , tourists will not come either , especially if competing tourism and business destinations open up wider without masks etc . i am looking at dubai in particular , and they have consistently outperformed singapore in every economic and global connectivity metric for last two years . they ate singapore status ."
"talk about restrictions and then mention this country as nazi germany , and singapore is labelled as racist ."
the inquisitor shut up . period
the inquisitor now thats what neo quasi nazis would do to you .
triloler thirty-nine look at what uae has done
"vincecarlo israel has dismissed further jabs useful for omicron w their stats . here , we extended the same vacc for children w omicron dominated wave ."
it just shows how cowardly the governments are and wanting to make a covid - nineteen a business
"enriching the big pharmas while putting lives n longivity at severe risk . for the full year two thousand and twenty-one , compared with $ forty-one . 7bn for the full year two thousand and twenty ."
vincecarlo stats from biotech industry shows the cost of r d in a vaccine cost roughly a billion usd . a ten billion net profit is already a one thousand %

isn t our daily local counts infected by the imports .....?
so what ? what s the point of living when you have to worry abt making ends meet ! and the worst part ? the likelihood of dying from covid nineteen if you are jabbed is super low ! so why worry ? the tourist dollars however makes a huge difference to our hawkers and our people . do not be selfish
local import local case local go other country vaccinated travel lane jalan jalan get the covid then come singapore invest covid
basically yolo
when will borders be fully open without restrictions ? boosters all done but held hostage

"besides malaysians that stay in johor bahru and come to work in singapore daily , there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johor bahru that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johor bahru daily . please allow land vaccinated travel lane gurantine free travel both ways for this group too , especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or upto four paxs if they are immediate family members . all vaccinated . also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johor bahru should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane gurantine free land travel soonest possible . this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they couldn t return to their johor bahru homes ."

all about extracting money so the people dwindles their savings and become dependent upon teh government further or just out themselves . this is nwo tactic .
"so if we use vaccinated travel lane travel to kuala lumpur , can we go out from kuala lumpur and travel to other town ?"

yes ! its time to open travel lanes between united states and malaysia to cross breed our covid efforts and generate new strains !

singapore must not open vaccinated travel lane at woodlands check point . malaysian government and it people s had a bad habit of switch off the tap water . etc . so what singapore needs to do now . just wait for another six months . high risk .
what does switching off tap water supply have to do with opening borders ?
singapore is heading for big trouble . we must stop free quarantine travel with malaysia for another six months . high risk .
great job by the govt of singapore . more countries will definitely come on board soon .
maybe earliest in two thousand and twenty-five .
thank you peoples action party … professional art should be a lot cheaper …. korea charging s $ two hundred - two hundred and fifty per pcr test

all must wfh but can open up so many vaccinated travel lane . cannot go back office but can go for holiday . can allow so many foreigners to come in n roam around singapore without quarantine n we still cannot go back to the office . what kind of logic is this ?
but i really dunno why not for malaysia
wfh for those able to do so . travellers that enter singapore also have to follow the measures in place and they are all vaccinated whereas in workplace or singapore itself some yet to be vaccinated .
"okay what wfh . why must go back office ? if you ask one thousand people , they also want . lol"

"that is the purpose of air vaccinated travel lane . i know why you asking this , because you hoping for causeway open right ?"
don t tell me some peoples are scare of vaccination . never heard of it . some eat healthy food and seldom fall sick which category are they in can protect people health .

"maca roon if so , two injection + booster is the not the matter , sc is not the matter , whatever we followed the govt regulations so far is not the matter , the matter is the country should be in vaccinated travel lane list , vaccinated travel lane is based on other country covid case and bilateral agreements . vaccinated travel lane is for other country people , for sc other resident strictly support govt actions for last 2years still suffer . our ( sc +) relationships countries are not in vaccinated travel lane list . face_with_open_mouth omg"

you want vaccinated travel lane to india or bangladesh ?

no mention of pcr test on arrival and pre - departure from singapore at $ one hundred and thirty-five . zero each plus hotel isolation pending test result . in any case why was rat accepted for testing changi staff ( at around $ twenty ) but arriving passengers are wounded financially ? as an australian i am taking a risk entering your country given your current high case numbers so i will defer malaysia holidays for another three - five months . i can here your locals cheering ... lol plus .. what happened to the covid breath testing systems being trialled at tuas ?
are they sure it s getting better .
as a singaporean living abroad - this is a step closer to visit hometown . i don t close their country for a really long time
expect more imported cases at changi airport for sure .
our largest investors will have privilege .
stop counting cases . the virus will stay forever like other diseases .
"why ??? there are still cases in spore yet you allowed outsiders to enter spore ? this is not preventions , it spreading the virus into spore then who suffer ? after late mr lky gone , spore law , rules regulations getting worse n doesn ’ t make sense . can the new government be smart like late mr lky ?"

do not need to keep on making sgreans look stupid like ..... everyday got foreigners entering singapore n after some time found to be infected ... then later blame sgreans n forcing to vaccinate . singapore cannot guarantee anything bcos our country will soon get bankrupt
if you open up to germany ... are you not indirectly opening up to the europe as a whole ( due to the relative freedom of movement within the union )? ... seems risky tbh
i got mixed feelings about this
we should open our borders to other countries that have a similar vaccination rate and vaccination effort as well as vs the no . of cases they experience at time of consideration . we really cannot risk covid further mutating into harder to contain strains .

"khairul iqram so you never been to europe ! which kampong you fm ? learn dude , when you travel within europe , there is no immigration stamp . within europe countries ."
"ezra singapore y need immigration , police if every1 is honest , truthful , sharing , kind ..... stop dreaming . expecially in pandemic , character change dude . since there is loop hole in immigration control , singapore govt should announce ,"
"jI ambaran residence i agree with you .. like i said this is everyone ‘ s resposibility .. if everyone is honest then the world would be peaceful .. but its otjerwise right .. so i guess singapore gov wants to try slowly lah ... I am living in germany .. the politics here itself is somehow not logic .. but just for your info , here also there is also control if one comes into germany from other higher risk europe countries ."
"ezra singapore aaaai ya , don t worried lah , they are too dumb to catch anyone . one mama from india worked in singapore as a senior management staff with fake credentials for more than ten years . that was why our famous small space jt is no longer manpower minitress"
"koh yang chi europe has twenty-seven countries , germany is the gateway to singapore . when they cross border each other , no checking . singapore should announce , schengen enter singapore quarantine free !"
what about india ?
uk ?? why should we go united kingdom ?? brexit has totally destroyed united kingdom ... its no longer a place to go to .... fifty-six % voted for brexit and fifty-six % are deemed racists .... worst still united kingdom cops rape and murder civilians ... and now lead by crazyhorse or sittingbull ...... sorry better go to thailand or any sea country ....

what are the vaccination rates in germany and malaysia ? what are the daily positive cases in these two countries ?
farrah kong what about china ? china has one hundred and eleven covid cases today compared to nine thousand and eight german cases ? where is the logic thinking_face
they are white (:
jerry ang you do know that there is no quarantine from china ? if you travel from china to singapore now there is zero quarantine required . so travelers from china already have an advantage over anyone else .
"farrah kong we have enough of malaysian . they are all opportunist , they can turn their back to singapore fast and swift ."
"jerry ang untrue , currently people from china can enter singapore and just do a swab test overnight observation . then if they re clear no need shn . ( for exchange students )"
problem is vaccination with sinovac in malaysia . this soup isn t working well .
koh yang chi but still i donno why we still suck up to china .. do not say singapore lah .. germany also the same .person_shrugginglight_skin_tone male_sign
koh yang chi just go google it . china and singapore as of writing really no need fourteen day quarantine unless sick .
koh yang chi yes . i know of someone who came to singapore from china last week .
"nine thousand maybe its unvaccinated ppl .. the travel lane still need to be fully vaccinated , than take test before departing germany , on arrival another test .. then 3rd day , one more test and seven day one more test .. so a lot of in place ."
"yes , we have infections thats a fact .. but you also have to see what is the per 100k population for the infections .. for example . singapore is six , five / one hundred zero population , germany : forty-four , nine / one hundred zero , malaysia : four hundred and fifty-one / one hundred zero .."
"tse hong ling .. ya lahh . too many checks lah .. one here in germany , and then have to pre paid for pcr tests ni singapore .. face_screaming_in_fearloudly_crying_face"
"ezra singapore infection is one thing .. hospitalized is another . so far from united kingdom s example .. even though the cases are up .. the deaths and icu and serious cases are not that high . so hopefully it means most of those have no symptoms or just mild flu and stay indoors . we got to try opening up a bit .. even if its just two countries .. unless we want to remain shut till two thousand and twenty-three .. by sept eight , vaccination rate in singapore should be over eighty % maybe eighty-one % which makes nine % unvaccinated .."
"tse hong ling .. i agree with you .. singapore has to open up slowly .. of course there will be trial n error in the begining .. is not it the direction that we all should get vaccinated .. although even when one get vaccinated , one can still get the virus .. but at least whn one is vaccinated and also follow protocol , the chances are much lower than those who did not want / not vaccinated ."
"ezra singapore i think its unusual for a country to take stages to open up , since so far we have only seen countries like united kingdom who opt to go or have restrictions in place , for singapore to try and pick a middle route and how to manage it .. its harder and no one knows how it will turn out so a lot of skeptical and negative comments . hopefully it will be fine .."
"tse hong ling well .. we have start somewhere .. but at least a decision is made .. be it good or bad , we do not know , let us hope fir the best .. i remebef when singapore closed since eighteen mar last year , n then people in singapore are going restless .. n said they should open , now that singapore is slowly open , the people are afraid ?.. thats sad"
"ezra singapore as minister ong say there is three groups of ppl , one will say why dun open up more , scared for what ?? the other will say what ? are you crazy , shut the borders and dun let anyone in . the 3rd group just try to find a middle ground . so whatever we decide , either the 1st group or the 2nd group will come in to criticize ."
"osman ismail .. when it comes to children , i myself not sure its good or not"
"with the emergence of omicron , are we going to close our vaccinated travel lane with countries with higher risks and higher interactivities with sa and it neighboring countries ?"
"kns .. strict control on internal resident but open gates for the highest risk countries ... ya if you open gates to all then is time to lift up restriction on singapore resident , at least bet families members and closed one for house visit n dinning .... the virus not only looking for singaporean n pr .... and these foreigners are main carriers too ...."
"omg , exactly what i needed"
"stupid idea to open borders for india , their case s are still so high . what is singapore government doing !!! put knife on our medical team and singaporean again !! pouting_face"
this is madness . how can vaccinated travel lane be given to india ? haven ’ t singapore suffered enough from the india delta variant ? why welcome the delta variant plus from india ?
why india is included when its infection rate is one of the highest ????
"it mention that those twenty-one countries are most contributors to daily arrivals in singapore before pandemic . if yr country is not considered as significant contributor , be patient to wait for next vaccinated travel lane or pay for shn at hotels ."
"there are naive , dumb pple that are overjoyed by lower daily cases , is it really so ? unlikely !"
expect covid cases to get worst !!!!
"yes ,, singapore is land of virus"
the delta variant has done enough damage . time to open more vtls . its time to welcome the delta plus variant .

"i pity those who went back and thought they can have a three months break and come back to singapore after the circuit breaks . most of them thought , they are entitled to their old jobs or they could frogged to another company like before . unfortunately , many did not get to return . either the company fold up or the boss taking this opportunity to dismiss the unproductive . of course , there are many hardworking who got to return with all expenses paid ."

i s but singapore is so much smaller to begin with . this is a step in the right direction rather than the immediate opening of a land vaccinated travel lane that could result in a usual daily traffic volume of 30k via the causeways .

"give one inch , don ’ t ask for a foot ! wait and see … if cases go up with this vaccinated travel lane how ?"
no need to open .... malaysia ? where is malaysia ?
malaysia is our hinterland
if there is vaccinated travel lane by land ( even if its not the pre covid daily of 500k people crossing ) then singapore will be seeing one hundred to three hundred death min a day because of the population density and distribution . johor bahru will also see a spike in cases and crimes .
they will overwhelmed our hospital .

"simply put , singapore is not interested to establish full vaccinated travel lane with malaysia . so malaysians folks will have to rely only on the air route . singapore is only interested in attracting affluent travellers from overseas to spend within the country . cheap johor bahru shopping trip is a gone era ."
it is only johoreans that want sporeans back . i just wonder whether the rest of malaysians care .

"its impossible to execute vaccinated travel lane on land than on air as follow :- on the causeway or tuas , the crowd easily exceed the numbers of people exiting the mrt station during peak hours ."
so you mean only the rich can travel ? a ticket might be affordable for you but not for the masses .

sa bros where do you store the pcr kit to test travellers and trained personal . each pcr test takes fifteen to thirty minutes .... the q will be terrible !
zhen86 then why vaccinated people still need to do test ? what has / what is the point of vaccinated travel lane and getting the vaccine ?
calvin g because you can still get it after the jab . the jab is to reduce the chance of you dying .
the malaysians choose to work and stay here rather than their own country and home . nobody owns them . it s their own choice
zhen86 but there are vaccinated people dying from covid ?
"there are so many ways , do not need million dollar salary to figure it out . just activate ferry booking system , there is also the woodlands waterfront / tmft / harbour front that can be used as ferry terminal . everybody will pre - book the tickets , so no overcrowding . for buses and trains , just add more frequency and allow pre booking , or control the bus . example fifty persons per bus and assign the buses , based on bus licence plate number . if they can do app for trace together bus app can also be done . same for train , there already is a system for booking , there will not be any over crowding . i took the train so many time already . it is very good"
thia terry singapore gov just want the daily cheap workers from malaysia . take ferry those worker find not worth to come in .
both governments are trying to find ways to help changi airport and klia to milk some money out of those so eager to travel .

coshinc provided malaysia and indonesia agree to let united states do to record high numbers of cases in the world is here in singapore
gamer studio indonesia should be keen too
"coshinc i hope so , that will be very jenerous from them i garanty you singapore gov . will never acept those terms if we was in oposite situation"
vtl air is again for the rich .
"hi smart guy , can teach united states a fool proof way to make sure twenty thousand people are negative and vaccinated proof is real ? by the way is daily . not happy , spend a bit on the air ticket and go home ."
"one more thing , why never compliant about thailand land border still closed ?"
so malaysian s are poor need land to cross over . just like seven month hell gate open for money hungry .????
air ticket also cheap lah not rich also can pay lah
if you asked a malaysians . of course they are greedy to now ask for land vaccinated travel lane and making excuse they are costly . other fdw have no qualm of flying back to meet their families . cost is not a concern when families matter . given them an inch and they greedily take a mile .
actually only johoreans care about the land vaccinated travel lane . i live in kuala lumpur and the cost for flight and driving almost same .
locals on both sides not too keen on this . its gonna create a large scale pandamic for singapore . peoples action party might gonna aim for 10k daily cases . maybe then will push singapore to extinction .
"dave choy lol , who likes their own comment ?"
what has / what is the diff between thousands of infections daily vs pandemic ?
"zero cases is an impossibility , you still think trying to hide from an omnipresent virus would work ?"
ops blac has any peoples action party elite been infected and gained natural immunity ?
influenza cases in singapore is a lot higher than covid cases but nobody cares and live normal . why not use the same terms for that ? as a malaysian i don t understand what singaporeans really want . you blame the gov if they close the border but now planning to open up and you still blame them . learn to move on like western countries did because our vaccination rates still higher than them
"black wolf influenza does not affect the lungs the way tb and covid do . many covid cases shown lungs damaged . i not sure if every case but many cases . your ignorance gives you the feel good bliss . you got pass o level or nots ? by the way , your bliss is based on yet to be proven no loong term side effects from mrna . your habit of making feel good assumptions is amazingly amuzing"
"black wolf as a singaporean , i do not understand what malaysian really want . why come singapore to work when malaysia have work ? you blame the government but still come here . we singaporeans knows our government can do a better job and you malaysians know your government can do a better job ."

why would any tourist wanna come here now .. with two pax restrictions . just go full endemic already .
they should not let those who are below 12y . o fly . if the parents want to fly with their kids who are un - vax they should be on a non vaccinated travel lane flight . what if the children are the carrier of the virus .
living with covid is like sleeping with enemy !
justfair take your pfizer and moderna every six months so that you can live with covid virus !
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures . may be time to do better and have more humanity .

"eh you so scared of covid that your fear can feed you and your family no need to put food on the table okay lah ? just because you okay with living in fear like that doesn ’ t mean everyone have to follow you okay . you scared you ownself lock yourself at home , don ’ t stop other people from carrying on with life . we already been doing everything we can to fight covid and for so long . if covid last one hundred years , one hundred years you want people to self quarantine at home , cannot go to work , cannot eat freely , cannot go out , cannot travel is it ?"

"if only they have been bothered to listen to the plights and sufferings of fellow singaporeans , they would have acquired the skill - sets and critical knowledge in dealing with real issues and challenges on the ground much more effectively . until this vital question is addressed reflectively by more singaporeans , there is simply no reason in asking if singaporeans deserve better …"

hi .. do we need to print the boarding pass in counter due to vaccinated travel lane flight ???
why united states ? how about your asean neighbors ?
you like to stay closed ? why are worrying so much ?
fiost well singapore a few weeks ago daily cases were only a few hundred but now it s a few thousand a day . so prepare for heavier restrictions soon .
not a cat it will ultimately be good for spore to open up
then blame higher cases to the unvax .. really shite face_with_symbols_on_mouth
maria maria they didn t blame the unvaccinated for cases . they just feel heart pain so many unnecessary deaths for unvaccinated
"i hope by end of the year all restrictions moved . no more mask , social distancing etc . let ’ s just live our lives normally . stop using covid to control united states . people die every day from many things . cannot stop people living just because you might die from covid . die from smoking , ban cigarettes ? die in car accident , ban vehicles ? most people who get covid will not die , just a runny nose . no need to got o hospital . stay home , then hospital cases go down , then we can open up ."
they have high vaccination rates . asean still struggling .
and here we go ...
"i think the job the local media does to explain the situation , the facts , actions and scientific background is not good enough . you had also to mention that all these countries have already liberated their travelling , and they have mostly a lower new infection rate as compared to singapore , because their local transmissions are half and lesser than the number that singapore currently has . so if risk - then it s rather true they risk something by coming here ."

kai yin it will be useful if we all know what has / what is the underlying problems for the people who pass on from covid so people with these underlying problems can avoid going out more often .. thus helping save lives
justfair hahaha i like ur word ignorant . they give payouts all the time till covid is over . the bankruptcy of construction companies resulting in incomplete btos already is a very worrying sign . even the govt unable to help them . what makes them think they can continue helping singaporeans in the long run with borders kept closed huh . dumb fks that complain whole day but nv see them coming up with better solutions .

"si dunue i am least bothered on your lies . seen enough xenophobic ah bengs in recent days . so nothing to be surprised . yes delta variant started in india . india do not deny or lie like china . there were few other variants before that too . malaysia sister caught covid from her chinese colleague . we do not stigmatise like some ugly people with low values . indeed its wuhan virus that transcended into alpha n delta n so forth . not bad . for once china produced a durable product that makes the world turn . just wait n see , how the world treat you guys ."
good seven month over now open again how delta coming in the apply for permit to come prof do not talk too much cock he think variety show like to clown said can be ten thousand per day
"my current worry is ... will singapore have our very own mutated variant ? if yes , when will it surface ? mutated variant usually happened in countries that open and let covid grow freely . some expert claimed that it is unlikely that covid will mutate further giving scientific explanations . but who knows ?"

"a lot of international university students from south asian countries are suffering as they cannot enter singapore due to the travel restrictions . these countries ( nepal , bangladesh , sri lanka ) and even others are doing exceptionally well with all nearly of them recording less that seven hundred cases daily . we understand that it may be risky to open a vaccinated travel lane lane , but perhaps consider letting them enter through a two week quarantine lane after being fully vaccinated ? their final exams are being held in - person physically , they may not be able to sit for them if the restrictions continue . please understand their situation ."
not at the moment please . we are not ready to received students .
"no , for tourist and business men now only ."
"sg hospital beds not enough , students have to wait six months for singapore covid situation to improve ."
"eric phua theres only a handful of students that come in yearly from the blocked countries , less than fifteen - twenty . if they are fully vaccinated + after quarantine for two weeks , what more do you want ? by your logic letting in tourists and businessmen ( who are larger in number ) is more dangerous ....."
"hei dei . but the return is more . businessmen if they get covid , will pay for their own hospital fee in private hospital that can amount to usd 30k to 50k for treatment . they will not tax our public hospital . singapore privates hospital can also make some revenue ."
"eric km its not right to assume all of these twenty odd students that would come in will get covid ... even if they do they are likely to have mild / no symptoms and can recover at home ( like the ninety-eight . six % cases in singapore ) as they are fully vaccinated . you have missed malaysia point entirely though , entry for students is open for students from countries with higher covid numbers , some even have vaccinated travel lane lanes , but south asian countries ie - nepal , bangladesh , sri lanka etc . are blocked off completely even though their case numbers are much lower ...."
"hei dei . i did say the students will get covid . but nobody can say for sure right ? anyone including myself might get it , just a matter of time . i just say the singapore vaccinated travel lane countries businessmen have the abilities to pay for their own private hospitalization in case they down with covid delta plus ."
eric km yes but i am referring to students .... why are students from vaccinated travel lane countries allowed to enter ( when they even have higher covid cases ) and not the south asian countries i mentioned before ?
yes united states is very safe lol
"hei dei . because these advance countries also give singapore students free scholarship ( in their countries ) in exchange . just wait patiently , when singapore covid situation improved , we will have vaccinated travel lane with more countries . we are now busy work vaccinated travel lane with countries like japan , switzerland , qatar , dubai ( uae ), oman . it take time ."
eric km yes i understand what you mean . i just hope that singapore will allow quarantined travel for united states if a vaccinated travel lane is not possible .
"hei dei nine more deaths as singapore reports three , three hundred and forty-eight new covid - nineteen cases today . touch wood , if anything bad happen to the foreign students if they here , people will condemns singapore for it . we prefer to be safe than sorry ."

"fr nov 1st two thousand and twenty-one , australia is allowing only australian , prs and families back into the country without quarantine . australian pm made a clarification after nsw premier s announcement ."
"may i suggest to ban the unvax from hospital ? or at least give them a choice to choose between getting vax or will be ban from hospital treating covid related matters . and if must admit to hospital unvax , there will be extra $ five thousand fine to be paid first . but all these under one condition , that the unvax remain unvax for life without any mandate to be vax for life . since this is about protecting the unvax and not discriminating or punishing at the same time saving hospital resources . i assume the unvax will be able to do laundry , go to school , go to work , eat , do all things normally except going to hospital with covid related illness as above . and put a stop to any discrimination towards the unvax by stopping the mandate of anything into the unvax body for life . then we can coexist sincerely and happily . let us reach a compromise and collaboration . this exchange of banned from covid related hospital vaccine treatment is voluntary exchange for living a normal life without restrictions again . dvv"

"nic yeo many of these like hypertension , obesity or cardiac problems require long term medical therapy . you would be surprised how many do not follow the instructions given by uncle doc ."
peter kroll thats why should disclose the underlying problems for those who pass on because of covid . so people with such underlying problems can avoid going out often and that saves lives
"nic yeo i forgot to mention diabetes to hypertension , obesity or cardiac problems . these four ."
peter kroll if so many of united states with underlying health issue which caused death government should have know better not to expose united states to covid .
"fr0zed it is not . singapore has one of the lowest fatalities in the world . also , these health problems do not go away by itself . they are vulnerable ."
peter kroll lowest fatalities only means we got good healthcare system which when over capacity don t mean a thing anymore .
"fr0zed one of the best healthcare systems in the world , and this is not the usual marketing burp . but here people run around like headless chicken ."
peter kroll i myself do not know what singapore is doing . on one hand they restrict singaporeans movement to socialized on the other hand did not restrict incoming travel passengers . i think it s fine if someone tells me the increase in number of cases does not increase the number of icu and hospital bed been occupied . but it does increase those two number does it ?
"fr0zed the government argues that the incoming travelers via vaccinated travel lane are only people who are vaccinated and tested . most singaporeans are vaccinated but not tested . i do however agree it is enough by now , the seems somewhat overboard . if the entire family is vaxxed then there is not much reason they can not go together , anywhere ."
peter kroll precisely . i get it that some of the population is not yet vaccinated and will be of the higher risk group as compare to those vaccinated . but if that s the case why some seem free of the restriction while others are not ?
what about own citizens working oversea ? typical singapore govt prioritising foreigners again ..

we need for singapore and johor check point open .. we can t wait now .. from woodland and johor check point if can open next january or february then we can enjoy to go malaysia
and japan is not included for countries allowed to operate vaccinated travel lane flights into singapore .
the vaccinated travel lane flights are stupid expense . good luck with that .
"don t rent accommodation or even spend much here and rather spend hours travelling to and fro malaysia to earn singapore dollars . by not allowing vaccinated travel lane , they will be forced to continue renting accommodation and spending on daily necessities here , like other foreigners from other countries . this will be beneficial to singapore economy ."
best to expedite construction of the mrt from singapore to johore . why still waiting ? for for change of malaysian government ? so much time has been wasted ! for the benefits of malaysia and singapore .
thanks to the corrupt mahathir who hates singapore
can i know how much in total for vaccinated travel lane flight including all the pcr test for per pax ?
how to get to express lane for pcr testing ?
"purpose is to support sia , not singaprean place of interest money-mouth_face"
"all doctor , medical team , engineer , auditor , researcher and etc !! please pack your bag and out from singapore .... we no need you all anymore . ai can replace all foreigner !!!"
"health insurance i feel is a scam . i rather , just try to keep fit , and have a lot of saving ."
"until you need it , you won t know how valuable it is"
"singapore removed from europe travel list , may affect vtls - on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country , the europe said : they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid - nineteen , as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources . ref : asiaone miw failed internationally ?"
but the singapore state media never said they failed ?
dave bakchoy do you need s up two thousand and twenty-five .
"eu has bad attitude . they look ang mo , but many of them anti vax . better singapore stay away for awhile from them ."
malaysians working here have the best of both world . good job and money here and great housing and car back in malaysia . shiok !
good for the worker who are working in singapore .. they can t effort to travel by air .. they should working in their own country .. it good for economic of their country ...
"their own country is corrupt , and economy is poor because the government officials are not as competent , smart corrupt - free as singapore ."
this is what happen when you got a team of gov who only care abt $$$ over ur life . this lee gonna lead united states to doom by depending so much on others than own
so like this singapore - kuala lumpur need to consider vaccinated travel lane by swimming across as an option .... nah .. just joking ... ferry could also aid a controllable flow of masses for both traditional partners .
if family is the priority ... do not talk cock by saying its costly ....
of course la ... we do not need a scientist to understand the mechanism of singapore n malaysia both waiting to pluck every hair from united states .
"five hundred , zero daily , wait singapore build more medical facilities , wait for more medical workers employed first , wait for makan places to do away with trace together , wait for singapore to buy more ambulances , wait for singapore to buy more test kits and test is not free for foreigners . wait wait wait .."
what is money when you get a chance to see your family after more than one year .
if l will a malaysia l work in malaysia own country island of singapore .
why are all the travellers from the west ?
california governor gavin newsom suffering from a s booster shot .
also expensive for singaporean . not just malaysians .
ntuc travel insurance is one of the best coverage so far compared to other travel insurance .
i t mind take multiple pcr test as long as i can eat penang nasi kandar beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes

"we just wait2 and wait .. not only malaysia , some of them going bck to batam bcause of kids and wife there"
is china hong kong tw macau sk are from the west ?
allow land vaccinated travel lane as a one way means for malaysians eyeing to go home for a longer period and not to and fro for frequent work . maybe set a year at least .
"that is not vaccinated travel lane , that is one way ticket home ."
it is always and all about heavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_sign
go back malaysia and don t come back forever then not expensive already !
100k malaysian please go back and dn came back your country have no jobs meh face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
funny singapore used to be member state of malaysia how ironically bias
"jiel cm want to go to other countries and make use of theirs system to earn money , always comes with a price . nothing new ."
this is fair to singaporeans that malaysian workers have to stay here . their spending while making a living in singapore serves to benefit singaporeans too .
"china . taiwan , hong kong covid too low , so they see singapore as a dangerous , infected nation ."
but singapore is already over populated . by keeping malaysians workers staying here it will just lead to higher housing price !!!
kon yaku rental prices go up because of malaysians and it leads to singaporeans unable to rent because owners prefer to rent to malaysians for higher prices because they got no choice but to pay to stay in sg
"you asked a malaysian , of course they said costly by air . pressuring singapore to have vaccinated travel lane land . but other foreigners missing their families have no qualm about the cost to meet them ."
what about all the many thousands they earned from taking jobs in singapore ?
they are doing the jobs singaporeans are not willing to do . be grateful
pay the cost for the risks for both countries . before that required to open vaccinated travel lane now said costly .
malaysian want to earn sing dollar and go back to their landed home and spend ringgit every single day .! you think they stupid ?
wait long2 lah by roads may be year two thousand and twenty-three
boba fett that was already in placed before this .
silly rule of having panel doctors !
panel of politicians you mean ?
"old lee after two years of pandemic , we all realised doctors and politicians are interchangeable . they earned both sides . bank account now all full ."
every panel of doctors will be rejected by you guys
rs lin oh that panel is doctors ? same as fucci ?
testing positive in overseas will be problematic and very costly . travelers need to be well prepared with $$$$ and know the risks .
don t forget to buy ntuc travel insurance . it cover up to 150k medical expenses !
"tua pui kia and read fine prints like quarantine lodging / accommodation requirements , pcr tests , additional communication fees , food and other necessities during overseas quarantine etc ... are not covered . others like accompanying adults cannot claim etc . unless is necessary , don t risk ."
"as i have said multiples of times before ; safe guard the life - safety of all singaporeans , particularly the younger ones , elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority ."
a new song for all singaporeans to sing from now till election day so as to remind you of not to vote for the peoples action party . the song is designed to be sang everyday in every occasion until the resolve inside you rages and motivates you to cast your vote against the peoples action party on election day .
"as i have said , and proven correct ; gambling over a s outright risky . endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure ."
gambling to vaccination is very risky if you vacc have no one hundred % safe .
"twenty cabinet ministers and in five years term , ~ fifteen , zero people will likely have died away due to the epidemic . fifteen , zero divided by twenty = seven hundred and fifty times of miseries , is another way of looking at it ."
"want to open vaccinated travel lane , then scare here scare there , better close back loh"
"take a trouble to johor bahru eat cheap food , buy cheap foods hahaha !!!"
"singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met . malaysia fellow singaporeans , join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the peoples action party . to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one , use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this because . the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute , it is time for a revolution . revolution of our times ."
"now is not the time to travel yet , think you need to take test everyday , if you get the virus in malaysia , you want to stay at the hospital there ?? or come back to singapore ??!!! one more thing , many malaysian out of jobs , now many robbery in malaysia waiting for singaporean to go in ! very dangerous to go in now . but if those rich singaporean don s ok , can go !"
"snoopy . considering the size of malaysia compared to singapore , i think the malaysians is solving crimes better than singapore ."
oh yeah only 3000daily reported covid infection honestly ??? and opening the country what do you think
why go on a witch hunt on rk s case and waste value resources instead on concentrating on the pandemic ? look now we have omicron cases at the airport . we should close our border for the time being . money can be earned later . please have a heart for singaporeans .
"how can sane person go johor bahru just for a day in this situation ? i d rather stay here than taking a risk ... even if no test required ,,, uh uh ...."
ten years pandemic havelah !!
bring the cheap groceries sell in ntuc la . problem solve for the shoppers
stupid to suggest and think singaporean to visit malaysia just for the fun ..... c mon man .
two years can tahan to johor bahru y must rush ter .... bcoz everything cheap .... can go value shop mah ....
if they don t increase petrol tax and gst we will be slightly cheaper . but stupid ars increase liao .. so cannot go down .. viagra bustard
"then why not closed the vaccinated travel lane ? since the spread of omicron is so great , even eating in restaurants as reported the couple are being infected even fully vaccinated ."
"border control makes sense only when you don ' t have it locally , like china , new zealand etc . if it is spreading like wildfire locally and infect one hundred % soon ( the united states is close to that stage already ) then obviously external visitors are no more a threat than any local . this is the day i knew will come sooner or later since march two thousand and twenty"
vtl for motor when sir ..
two thousand and thirty
why want to invite all the troubles n hassles onto oneself just for that day trip across the causeway .?
"go johor bahru one day !? need seven days of art test . don t be foolish , we are still in the pandemic ! understood , vaccinated travel lane to malaysia is meant for msians working in spore to see their loved ones , long vacation is required ."
what a stupid question . who on earth will use vaccinated travel lane on day trip ?????
"if singapore can hv its way , no day trip at all is the mandate . but what to do ... who is pressing for opening of borders at causeway ? not sg"
"some of the singaporean might not be so happy about the government , of course they have a lot to improve , but compare with hong kong government , they have done a lot better ."
so risk to malaysians going back to johor bahru is not the same as risk to singaporeans going to johor bahru for shopping ?
consider very carefully ??? you just decided to embrace herd immunity band flung the doors wide open allowing more than a few hundred thousand cases of covid in the last few months and nearly one thousand cases in icu ...... all for the sake of ur economic growth at all cost and cheaper better faster population ponzi economy ..... you treated millions of human lives as literally nothing but animals for the slaughter ...... and ur telling united states to consider carefully ????? is there any limit to ur shamelessness and hubris and hypocrisy ? i m starting to consider maybe the ccp government might be more humane when looking at their own people .
don ’ t go to johor bahru !! malaysia still four thousand ++ cases ! don ’ t sabo singapore !!
"us , united kingdom , spain have not been able to control the covid nineteen virus again to very high risk united states , united kingdom , spain , australia , india , japan etc ."
four thousand + cases but over a population of fifty million
wshyang ah one case is already case too much !!
meaning : if you go i ll give hard time after that .... hehehe
not for holiday
"consider very carefully , because your outdated clot shot doesn t protect you !"
"if one day trip , how many pcr test need to do ?"
no where in what he said has
journalists are very nice towards peoples action party but when dealing with opposition all the tough questions comes in .
journalists own by sph . sph own by singtel . singtel own by temasek . temasek own by ? face_with_tears_of_joy
freedom of doing whatever they want ( democrazy ) the virus also has the freedom to out spread . face_with_tears_of_joy
what is so nice ?
"please la , just because he said do not go , then we do not go ? if so worried , then closed off the vaccinated travel lane la . if not just wait for things to unfold and we will see how our capable government handle it ."
"the day singaporeans rise up that is the day all this nonsense will stop . this people will keep on holding you people , keep enslaving you people while they enrich their pockets through this plandemic coz all this virus its all plan to continue to push the vaccine ."
do not go lah for the moment . only really important then go . support local business first .
we want to support local businesses but cannot . not only do businesses need our money they also demand we be vaccinated .
a very responsible and capable s pore govt . great advice !
"aiyah try not to come johor bahru shopping , come only if necessary or important like if you have family here or if you have business here . simple ."
all these mtfucker t matter to them also . $ come first right .
"seriously you care about rk issue alot ? hahahaha that one peoples action party plot it so that people will , forget co , vid and then destroy all opposition so that people will not vote . i see one dumb girl make wrong al people forget how many kinds of mistake peoples action party also did ? first of all co vid is not over there is cases here n peoples action party what they doing they don t care rk case . they wasted nine hours in pritam singh get nothing instead netizen laughing at peoples action party now especial the cop n people supporting workers party after that you see it really hit back peoples action party a lot . they nerd get rid of shanmugam that guy keep finding fault . if rk did wrong she should be in court or morever she resign ready so ok done . why keep dragging . edwin tong potential law minister useless he look like the ah boy to men recruit nerdy guy hahahahaha"

"aiya how to day trip ? you go thr so much of the shops closed . only a few there lor , like the teck sing chicken wrap paper , go thr nothing to eat , for what ?"
"if you can make this statement , just close the borders la . vaccinated travel lane with high risk countries united kingdom and united states , silent ."
"soo tuck choong vaccinated travel lane with united states good for our business , why no ?"
"singapore needs to open borders ... if not we have no economy lmao , want to end up like johor bahru ? close our airports and checkpoints ."
cannot forever close . how people going to feed their families like this ?
"kai yin what I am trying to say here was , going to johor bahru is safer than going to united states / united kingdom . those people disregard safety protocols like mask wearing . you dun see johor bahru people make protest on the street for lockdowns ."
ed fong are you sure it is safer to go johor bahru ?
ed fong i didn t make that claim that going united states / united kingdom is safer than jb
covid cannot be controlled so live with it .
"does anyone really think pandemic will ever be over ? already say get comfortable living with virus yet we open boarder to have even more intensive test when when boarder is close for what . either way government has no idea what to do when new version come out each time , now got omnicron what is next decepticon ?"
it won t be over . what is the nbr they are looking
albert ng why numbers matter ?
daniel leong so close border and let people live in hunger is that what you want ?
boba fett do you understand what i am trying to say instead of trying to think what i am saying . all this time i am saying stupid idea of singapore govt to put so much restrictions as mentioned virus never end so why stupid to put so many restrictions especially with vaccinated travel lane still swap everyday and minister still say even if vaccinated travel lane is there better not go . so please be clear i do not believe closing boarder is going to be solution neither is seven days self art test with two days at supervised locations what happen you get infected at supervised locations who you think pay for quarantine at hotel . so be clear to all who is reading and i am not for close borders i lost malaysia job two years ago due to close border
daniel leong so will all this measures be effective when recent news reported that sinovac jab is not effective enough to fend off omicron so what has / what is the next step now ?
"boba fett why ask me i want to travel also but without the need for seven days swap ( inclusive of two days supervised swap ) at other country and seven days swap ( inclusive of two days supervised swap ) when back in singapore , ask the government so called expert who tell united states asymtomatic no need to wear mask now we know it was because there was supply shortage . also for sinovac it is something malaysia friends and relative in china do not want to take due to side effects and so many here want to take . nothing to say ."
daniel leong malaysia advice is better do not do any travelling at this period cos omicron is still looming and all that testings are so hassling and can be confusing .
looks who ’ s talking ? the so called task force . i will be very very worried if they remain to be mps after the next election .
soo tuck choong vaccinated travel lane to india ok for you ?
no balls that ’ s why .
"be careful , be very careful . you never know what you will bring back . wahhahaha ....."
they just want people to stay in singapore because singaporeans will spend more money on petrol and hotels locally .
hopeless !!!
for the sake of business and family .. i willingly to take the risk .
but your family willing to take risk for you or not ?
"now it s asia africa era . go to africa , look how silk road innitiation is making ethiopia prosprous ! black americans already left for ghana because african americans are better of in africa now ."

"singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met . malaysia fellow singaporeans , join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the peoples action party . to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one , use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this because . the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute , it is time for a revolution . revolution of our times ."
"translation : don t go there to buy grocery , eat nice cheap food , pump petrol , wash car , massage then catch something and after that come back to singapore . open not for you to enjoy and unwind . open only to see relatives for reunion . come back test test test test test . the aim is to make it uncomfortable and expensive . must be safe mah . later open liao , numbers shoot up how ? kenna shoot by opposition how ? must cover back side lah ."

so many excuses .. tired to hear tiz ...
someone forced you to hear ?
chitchat ya .. malaysia bloody fwen .. but i do not want ...
"hey the question is how about those who want out of this country and leave this country , without being vaccinated , can they leave ?"
"why not create vaccination lane for johor , we are desperate left family more then year ."
it takes two country .
astor would much rather be in the “ shithole ” group that is looking toward the future and past the virus . would you rather be in hong kong where cases are incredibly low but a return to normality is not in sight at all ?
best thing to happen is to get half of singapore infected foreigners will have the chance to bring home the virus .
wfh for sgreans . holiday jalan jalan for foreigners .
finally the border is open !!!! aviation is back and singapore is back !!!
"vaccinated people get covid and spread it too . they are no different than unvaccinated people , except they may not get severe covid , but some still do . a test is a test . either test people and let them in , or quarantine everyone coming in . this is less about prevention than government control ."
two thousand here we go
"open leg policy . not a surprise delta + variant already arrive in singapore and spreading in the community , as well as lambda variant . just a matter of time to roll back when hospital cases surge ."

only rich expats get the privilege to visit their loved ones back home quarantine free … lucky them … many can ’ t even cross a short bridge to visit loved ones just for a few hours
many traveling out of singaporean because other country they are safer as lesser cases of covid to land area ratio .

nope . always blame unvaccinated . the vaccinated has a vote of approval from pap
"why should travel agencies be held “ accountable ?” if you or members in your party decides to vacation in germany , then it ’ s on you be accountable for their own actions , instead of always needing “ someone or somebody ” to look out for their personal welfare !"

boba fett buses n mrt train were immune to covid - nineteen
andrew lim its best to switch off aircon on all buses and trains and let the windows open all the way cos all circulated air disperse through the atmosphere .

flight travels is the real culript for health care system collapse .
"at ninety % icu limit , still opening wider ? thats suicidal . where is their common sense ? whoever introduced and approved this nonsense is seriously clueless and disconnect !!!"
imported cases
i still don t understand the rational to open borders when we still impose restrictions within communiry
absolutely no sense .
uk ?? why should we go united kingdom ?? brexit has totally destroyed united kingdom ... its no longer a place to go to .... fifty-six % voted for brexit and fifty-six % are deemed racists .... worst still united kingdom cops rape and murder civilians ... and now lead by crazyhorse or sittingbull ...... sorry better go to thailand or any sea country ....

"why can people visit denmark where the covid cases are climbing , instead of indonesia where the cases are dropping ?"
"then why is peoples action party govt still importing tourists from high - infection rate countries like denmark and brunei , quarantine free ?"
what they should have shown are the ground zero where healthcare workers are struggling to keep up with the increase of patients so that the citizen understand their struggle and keep in mind to follow the measures strictly . but no they show this
pandemic . rich can travel . poor cannot even eat woth family becauss of max capacity dine in at two . travellers still welcome . vaccinated discriminated against unvaccinated . we deserve to perish .
the price were more expensive
seems all are well planned but we are dealing with types of virus which could easily spread . verifiable cert issued by these countries are questionable there is no one hundred % guarantee it is genuine . we are actually taking chances hoping all this measures taken works smoothly . don ' t be too confident . reopening the border need to be dealt with carefully . we can ' t afford to make mistakes . politicians will always be politicians it ' s our life they are risking . we are concern .
cna must be desperate to hire instagrammers for a news segment
how much extra did they pay ?
i have noticed that lately
hk is right to burst the hong kong - sin travel buddle coiled by the useless ong . simply love hong kong and their effectual governance .

why is singapore peoples action party govt screening lavish europe lifestyle traveling during a pandemic where people are losing job ?
we need vaccinated travel lane between malaysia and singapore . family ties that matter . please consider
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
what happened to peoples action party s promise of the promised to open up after eighty % vaccination ?
perverted action party
i will laugh when germany start to have covid - nineteen infections or the travellers get covid

next door neighbour such as indonesia and malaysia are being shut off . germany open . singapore promoting to attract ft via their new plan of covid nineteen green lanes .
this is outrageous ... shut at home for commoners and travel pass for the rich / elite / highend .. we are treated as fool in our homeland .
this is ridiculous ! the interview is basing europe like it ’ s a war zone !
singapore isn ' t ready for many countries . their verification method are questionable . don ' t take the chances . we need to be sure .
why 3x the dislikes thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down
please report if they happen to die
"guys , please do not be sold by the word safe . they should have people communicating this , she ll wear a mask at all public places ."
when vaccinated singaporean cannot even eat outside with family of five . group of six vaccinated travellers can go to germany for holiday . is not that weird ?
don come back being test positive
wah . go out of singapore . you are saved liao .
"hopefully they can open up lanes to more countries soon , especially europe , korea , new zealand , australia and possibly hokkaido in japan where it is more rural ."
"just a very honest and curious question here , not making fun of anybody here , do singaporeans pronounce ?"
ridiculous to allow imports in under vaccinated travel lane to gallivant all over spore but impose severe restrictions on own locals . new variants like mu will or may already have arrived
family ties travel lane again ?thinking_face then how about vietnam ?
"just open up la … seriously this virus have a fatality of zero . five %, and ninety-nine % can recover at home . for zero . five %, you are willing to decimate the entire economy and eat up all our reserves ? it takes common sense to know that we are overreacting to a virus that we have gotten used to . this is coming from someone who has gotten the virus geez"
what a trashy family
lol all the poor singaporeans being salty in the comments
novita looks like she ’ s talking to her crush .
people are dying just buying food .. why is this group travelling ? what common sense is this ?
"the travellers are quite brave to agree to be interviewed . to be honest , i expected more poorly conceived , needless negative comments that serve no purpose except to show the extreme bias and misdirected bitterness of the commenters ."
they shld b tested on their return as to make sure they do not bring in covid - nineteen virus
oh yes they did . don t feel so scared
"rs lin almost 2k new cases daily , many many people confirm scared !!"
lee chong even scared we must be gracious isn t it ?
rs lin die graciously ?! ghost mission impossible
are they volunteer suicidal ? pig_face
lmao two influencers … big fat hairy deal
"if got covid19 there , then bring it back to singapore , thank you channel news asia . vaccination not one hundred % mah"
probably kena covid and thats it !
she look aged fast ..
instagram is full of photoshop
"entertainment is the biggest industry needed anywhere . singapore now has no more clubs , pubs as such . you opening your borders to these foreigners without the entertainment you might as well close it . anyways since non vaccinated is not allowed to dine in than why shut the fnb business at ten . 30pm . is there a problem with increasing the time to at twelve . 30am ?"
vincecarlo that ’ s why channel news asia did not use filters
wow so much inspiration travel to germany !! so much money !!!
and they say they are doing things to stop the spread of the virus .
who says we are closing ? this is 1st step to opening
"and when these group of ppl return , they start to spread delta variant in singapore and gov will say it is normal !!!!!! really selfish to max !!"
what s the point in covering this when we have gone back to the two pax restriction here ? just to rub it in to those who cannot travel ? and novita lam proving how the typical dense singaporean girls are .
errr .. are you asking vaccinated travel lane for vietnam ?grinning_squinting_face
"i think it s fine , just got to be safe"
"spot on . the risk is not catching the virus , but the restrictions your home countries will set on you if you catch it ."
"i would just enjoy malaysia extra time in germany and wfh from there . anyway , life there is probably more normal and less stressful than how it is in singapore ."
they will not close borders for citizens lah
"this is surreal . fully vaccinated people go on a holiday trip and get interviewed , because of that . and then reporter is asking , “ as the covid situation evolves ( i cannot hear that supermarket announcements anymore ) what made you go on that trip ” please people wake up , get you life back , stop being so anxious"
"cna waste their money for these six fools . whoever suggest this idea must be the biggest wanker . what does this coverage have impact for singapore or global ? like pre - covid , germany is top three country that sgporean visited is it ? obviously no lah person_facepalming female_sign"
why are you so triggered . we have to eventually return to normality . you really want to forever be in state of alarm ?
"funniest thing is , india pm visited united states and no major global news channels cover it . haha even heard that 3rd tier united states administration which welcomed modi . wow so much for big country of one . two billion face_with_tears_of_joy"
is maid in &; out matter not important ? how we local to move on live with old folks or babies but indonesia is not in the list of opening travellers too pls .
novita lam is too overrated anyway
vaccinated does not mean you cannot get the virus . you can still get covid19 .. n they do not haf to quarantine after coming back ??? dangerous !!!
scripted . how about the govt zooming in to this group as lab mice to test for the virus once they are back in sin ? report the stats to united states sporeans . wld be dying to know the outcome .
influence what exactly ?? high educated must read script ah lol
this is hilarious face_with_tears_of_joy! suddenly a traveller becomes a authority in covid lol !
hari somakantan cannot live like a tortoise who doesn t know what is happening outside .
hari somakantan anyway nobody is forcing you to travel and we don t know whether you can or not
"nowadays open border for one country become political problem , not healthcare or science problem"
rs lin and you think that is a good idea right ?
we need to start an ivermectin travel to johor bahru giant club challenge .. i rather trust that to prevent need for oxygen tanks ..
if only all the unnecessary travel is halted .... many poor people will be getting their meals . also unnecessary travel contributes to global warming ..... the next pandemic for which there is no vaccine .... face_with_rolling_eyes
rs lin can her richness prevent the future disaster .... although her refraining from such trips can save the world
is tat the reason the open the birder gir germany
influencer so desperate to travel and get some pics for instagram
these influencers are such a waste of space on earth . they literally have no talent . just look pretty and get paid millions lol .
thatsawesome how much ?
she s already rich in the first place lol .
let ’ s eat the rich
"the united states said trips to singapore ... have become more dangerous because of the coronavirus , raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hub .... from almost covid free to covid full . would india be next to advise against travel to singapore ?"
they gave the same advisory on hk
rs lin not quite . united states cdc raises covid - nineteen travel health notice for singapore to level three . united states cdc raises covid - nineteen travel health notice for hong kong to level two . the cdc s highest travel health notice is level four .
"yesterday two thousand, two hundred and thirty-six cases n five deaths then 5k"
vincecarlo united states cdc announced this morning that travel warning for hong kong was raised in error on monday . so hong kong remains at level one . singapore raised to level three . highest level is level four . won s plan to open up just backfired .
rs lin stop spreading fake news
what does this lane mean ? if someone is tested positive and is fully vaccinated ... are they allowed to fly back ?????
it ' s purely business money-mouth_face. all companies and country interested to invest in singapore are welcome .
"if tested positive , quarantine for twenty-one days ."
"chris tan ah .. what i meant was if the test in germany showed positive , before the flight . in other words we are unfortunate enough to get covid whilst travelling , what happens then ?"
"prior to boarding return flight , they have to take a pcr test . only if the result is negative , they will be allowed to board . back in singapore , they have to take one pcr at airport , then two more over the next few days ."
"( bloomberg ) — the united states said trips to singapore and hong kong have become more dangerous because of the coronavirus , raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hubs by one level . the united states centers for disease control and prevention said anyone who hasn ’ t been vaccinated should avoid non - essential trips to singapore , citing a “ high level ” of covid - nineteen . “ all travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading covid variants ,” the cdc said , increasing its travel advice for singapore by one notch to level three ."
while united states still posts higher infection rates than singapore and hong kong . stop using the united states as the gold standard please
"hey united states , speak for yourself"
it s hilarious that the united states posts advisories against any country when they have more covid cases than everyone else .
"in germany , singapore is still considered a safe destination though"
next target 3k then 5k daily cases for tiny 720km² island akan datang
vincecarlo what has area got to do with anything ? what you need to look at is cases / population . also singapore does much more testing than any other country so of course the number of cases will be high .

from united states ?! make sure they ’ re fully vaccinated !
all the salty comments . while i personally wouldn s the big deal to get everyone all riled up .
the ones at home are bearing the consequences of those travelling and bringing the disease back home . that s selfish .
"nicktasteless the ones at home are already producing one thousand, six hundred cases a day . importing a few more hardly makes a difference . in fact , those imported cases are almost always detected through multiple pcr tests . local cases are not always detected and spread more ."
"nicktasteless thare are only five import case . say hi to the one thousand, five hundred local community cases ! waving_hand"
"utku tefek where was it before one thousand, six hundred + ? less than twenty . everyday import import import . now see what happened ."
strawberryshortcake ^
you s a bit perplexing as to why this is news face_with_tears_of_joy
i guess they also brought portable oxygen tanks and portable icu monitors while travelling .
most are too busy in settling their two thousand and twenty election fraud and any sensible american would think twice before they stepped out .. the ones who did would higher chances would be lack of brains supporters of ice cream sleazy cheater joe ..
wads the fun in such ways measures in travelling ..
you catch the virus your problem
hey you forgot to add the “ paid advertisement ” tag
supporting lavish lifestyle traveling during a pandemic where people are losing job . well done channel news asia .
we saw months and months of news report and articles about people losing their jobs . one report about people travelling and you lose your mind .
"if you look at it from another angle , they are actually providing jobs in the tourism industry . keep your perspective open : d"
"they are clever at frauds whether open or not , they ' ll find a way . and of course , the government is good at sucking up the supposedly ."
and give her a break . it s not her fault to be rich and able to travel
jy lee how many in tourism industry being helped and how many families now suffering under home recovery and covid cases ?
in the other news :thumbs_upclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands
"these reporters is much better , she doesn t make everything sound depressing . the strait times people are just sadge ."
"i ve got friends posting their trips to maldives , united kingdom and united states now on insta , why are we acting like these trips to germany are all that special ?"
"sg can t get their local act together .... yet govt open up borders , but restrictions imposed on its citizens .. unbelievable !!!!"
how to be famous during covid : i travelled while other ppl cannot . got featured on channel news asia . channel news asia you are all time low now .
novita is already femes what .
"remy azhary yosef i rly don ’ t understand why singaporeans have an issue with this ‘ sucking up ’. when you ’ re a country as small as united states , of course we have to suck up ! without the help and money of these countries , we can ’ t sustain ourselves . take a look at australia , they decided not to suck up to china and accuse them of starting covid . and look what happened , china imposed a crap load of tariffs and australia lost out on a big source of export revenue . we need these countries on our side"
what a waste of her time to be talking to channel news asia while on holiday . her parents must love air purifiers .
awareness for united states who are scared
this is the propaganda tool by our fav govt .
"even when they are doing propaganda material , the actors actresses are still not up to par yet ."
that is normal for organized interviews ... if you have done or organize an interview before this is normal process . interviews question are often shared to prepare for interviewee the interview . though something some reporter might digress to get a headline out of the interview :)
crazy to travel at this time . no need to flaunt face_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyesface_with_rolling_eyes.
crazy to travel at this time face_with_rolling_eyes.
"please give me a time frame you think is suitable to travel ? when covid hit zero cases worldwide ? because that ’ s never going to happen . we are alr eighty +% vaccinated and ninety +% if we exclude zero - twelve age range … if you ’ re not willing to open up , then just stay home and let people do what they please"
group of six can travel overseas but fully vaccinated groups of five can ’ t eat out together face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
traveling and eating are two different things .
boba fett so are you saying it ’ s more risky for vaccinated folks to be out eating than traveling ?
coldbrewed the unvaccinated what about united states ? which lane do we take ? are we even allowed to book flights ?
darren rod depends if you eat outside during travelling . but mask off when eating definetly higher risk than walking around with mask on . also depends if where you re going high risk or not . need context for fair answer .
darren rod eating surely more risky cos mouth open all times eating and talking also air around is staganant while traveling lowest risk cos people moving around and mask on all the time so hope you see the logic .
"boba fett tell me , on a long haul flight from singapore to frankfurt , absolutely no food nor drinks are served to the passengers ."
amos cookie you mean the eighty-two % that took the wonderful super spreader mrna jab ?
in the other news :thumbs_upclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands

plsssss tell me singapore is not paying this over privileged fool s leisure teavelling with ordinary singaporeans folks tax payers money ...!!!!!!!!!!!
enjoy yourself safety and healthy
"seriously why need a script ? l0l our education fail , such interviews need to be scripted . or now singapore is closet communist ?"
did they hire instagrammers to promote travelling now ?
no theyre from wuhan tourism board
not to promote traveling . but to promote government propaganda . it s cheaper to pay instagrammer instead .
hopefully live back to normal
so she is happy that a group of six can travel ? trying to entice the unafraid and unvaxxed ppl to do the silly plunge ?
feel free to die from covid then . stay poor .
they are not safe because they are not vaccines . it is actually a bioweapon ( graphene oxide ) and it ' s caused by toxins and deficiencies
so channel news asia what made this as a news ?? so do we need to congratulate them for being able to travel ? the world has opened a long time ago ! only singapore has not ! lol
"didn t you read the salty comments , some thinks singaporeans should be hermits and stay home forever . this is news to them . lol ."
basically they re travelling all over the place all the time .
exactly . they really thought all singaporean are fools who read only channel news asia or st news . vaçcinated non - vaccinated all can travel as long as they fulfill the arrival country covid regulations .
"why so salty lol , you do not have to watch every single video channel news asia releases right ?? to me , it was pretty insightful to learn how other countries and people are different countries are dealing with covid and"

go until so chum … total waste of money and time
"what group of six ? not 600pax ? thought many ppl sign up ? good old days , ten - 20k goes johor bahru on weekend . what so great to be delighted with this at this serious juncture ? forgotten just germany and brunei . even hong kong did not join in bubbles ?"

india when it is likely
"you all bodoh or what , obviously when talking about issues like these they will share with her the qns they will ask so that she will not blank out on live tv right . so if she prepared the qns , and just wrote down to prepare herself that s normal what . the only thing you can zham is her memory cui la"
"hypercarryhd germany has average of seven , seven hundred daily cases this week . that ’ s not exactly “ fine ”. it ’ s always “ fine ” until it ’ s not . but if course , risk is on the traveller , you choose your own risks . if you get sick there and are stuck there , the expenses and troubles you face - are they worth it , that ’ s all ."
xie lian hua cheng soon to join n . korea n prc in bottom five
"another thing to note if the occupants in your flat do not have the same travel history as you , you must self isolate in a room with an ensuite toilet otherwise you have stay in a hotel to wait for your arrival test result . if it fails , go back to quarantine protocol ."
"btw , which travel insurance did she buy which didn ’ t require a pcrt before her departure to germany ? as far as i know , if you do not take the pcrt prior to leaving singapore , the insurance policy will be effective only on and after the 14th day of the travel ! this means if you have covid before the 14th day , you will not be covered for covid related illness . in addition , the risk of failing the pcrt before returning to singapore . you will have to stay in germany for at least ( including quarantine period ) twenty-one days before you are allowed to return to singapore , that is , if you pass the pcrt after twenty-one days in germany . so have to prepare for all these unexpected expenses which may not be one hundred % covered by the travel insurance . just hope that the singapore govt can look into this and relax the restrictions a bit . otherwise , it doesn ’ t help much of having a vaccinated travel lane scheme ."
"oh great , we are placing much restrictions within the country but outside in is open borders . great job gahmen , i recall how delta was brought in"
i will go anywhere with novita lam ... whether theres covid or not ...
wait . countries with more investment in singapore will get vlt first money-mouth_face. we will give japan and rest of europe countries first .

"as a hong kong resident who works in singapore occasionally . some of malaysia unvaccinated friends wanted to come to singapore ( there ' s no shn ), but i advised against it as you mentioned , they won ' t be able to dine out or entering malls ."
why not norway ??????????????? ffs
why now you want to shre tje shot
beware to those countries i must say . look at germany s situation now . covid is out of control eversince they re - openes border with singapore .
what have salaries got to do with this ? poor whiner
"don t understand the xenophobia against indian subcontinent . everyone blames india for spreading delta variant as if we did it on purpose . people forget where did the actual pandemic begin . grow up people , opening the borders is the only way out . plus the government is doing it in a step by step , calibrated manner . if something goes wrong , vtls will be halted . stop blaming one country or one nationality for your perils . last i check we are all in this together ."
the whiners had woken up
face_with_tears_of_joy
"? how about the other way around ? will they allow singaporean to enter their country ? do not you think singapore always get bullied by other countries , even by its neighbours ."
"vtl for all , foreigners still have to apply vaccine travel pass , while singaporean exempted and they just buy tickets and travel use vaccinated travel lane .. nobody is getting bullied"
hello how about united states .... malaysia hubby and i would lije to visit singapore .... we are fron the philippines fulky vaccinated already .... can we enter year february two thousand and twenty-two ? thank you very much smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyes
i hope so . and i think we will open to philippines too
"and still no philippines as the distribution of vaccines really slow , there ’ s only thirty-four % of fully vaccinated while the rest still on process of getting their second jab can ’ t blame singapore govt if philippines still not on their vaccinated travel lane lanes but hoping they ’ ll consider united states in near future . godbless singapore"
vaccination rates total insanity
why not algeria sad_but_relieved_face

"the title tells it all ... it is ' vaccinated travel lanes '. if the unvaccinated are allowed to travel , then is the country who ' exported ' them fault liao ."
well said . they are a frightened lot .
if singapore can open vaccinated travel lane lane to india when their cases are one of the worst in the world . i don t open to all . there are some hiden agenda .... what crap are they hiding from united states ?
"things slightly stabilise and the government brings in more problems . can ’ t understand this . besides , do we need these people ? i sure as hell don ’ t think so ."
can t shut down borders forever
life is for living and not hiding
my hair started falling when i see india is included . we don t have many rivers like theirs . big problem coming

"for fw , you think tourist ?"
"rev india has reported between ten , zero to twenty , zero cases per day . given the population of india , that ’ s far less than singapore ’ s infection rates . also , look at the size of singapore , and look at the size of india . singapore is a lot more dense than india is . chances of covid spreading here more rapidly is greater than in india ’ s at this moment . there ’ s a lot of herd immunity being built up there . finally , when singapore ’ s borders were closed , that was when most of its cases were spread . india was closed to singapore . most , if not all , cases in singapore have been internally spread . i ’ d suggest that you connect the dots better ."
aren t come back .
bmpcos he should go to india . one rape in every sixteen minutes . hahaha
amos yong so you live in a rape free society ?
did i heard wrongly ? maybe new variant ? so these travellers gonna each bring home a ? lockdown otw ....
"currently singapore is more threat to india than india to singapore . look at the percentage population , if you don s number and singapore covid cases and then talk"
industrial management watch channel news asia lately ? a reporter ( wearing mask ) doing news report in the street . and behind him many walk without wearing mask in crowded street . how genuine is the infection rate reported ? imagine social discipline in the rural area . face_with_hand_over_mouth
india has more herd immunity than united states .
yoda face_with_hand_over_mouth
wong francis thats crazy can ' t believe what this world has come to . discriminate against people who haven ' t had the vaccine wow .
"singaporean do not go other countries and spread virus there , stay put .. face_with_tears_of_joy"
sweetkiller xx other countries will accept singapore because we don t produce fake certs to work or travel .. rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
alzario you guys still good in forge documents haha ..
"alzario still google , microsoft , ibm , pepsico and other leading company are handled by indian ceo . i must say indian fake certificate are better than your original"
industrial management rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing is that the only thing you can say ? coming out from toxic air polluted country ? another one making whole world laughing . rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
"industrial management yes , but why no singaporean ?"
yes ... looking forward to go batam again .
"starlite seventy-seven i agree with you . although i ' m vaccinated , but i respect the choice of not getting it too . it ' s a mad mad world we now live in , sadly ."
"oops , singaporean should stay in their home country atleast until their gov managed to put covid under control ."
singapore are like being locked in the cage allowing external to infect united states but yet cannot leave .
why not y t talk as your country no covid at all .. singapore still considered high risk yet other country agree with vaccinated travel lane .. if scared dig a hole and live there .
most cases are internally spread
"are we really under restrictions ? look at mall and other places , seems like nobody gives a damn either"
please think about bangladesh Bangladesh
it will be soon we will finally open to all countries .
"so illogical india and indonesia included but not thailand . in addition , travelers from singapore to thailand enjoy quarantine - free travel ."
precisely
when it will be possible to travel from switzerland ? thanks for asking in advance
india is for fw n indo is for maids . you think for tourist ?
vincecarlo thailand is for the ahpek at massage spa
vaccination rates : total insanity
did thailand want to have vaccinated travel lane too ? probably thailand just want to close their border longer
no need quarantine ? delivery riders in singapore need to be monitored as the do swab at a test center weekly ? foreigners no need ? correct me if i wrong
covid19 is the best thing that has ever happened to united states as it allows united states to wfh . :)
wonderful ! the living has to go on living . clapping_handslight_skin_tonethumbs_uplight_skin_toneparty_popperconfetti_ball
please consider philippines also to have vaccinated travel lane please ... number of cases there are low already .. been away from family for 4yrs already disappointed_face
it will be opened soon to philippines
"the term vaccinated travel lane reminds me of disabled toilet . if it is disabled , it can t be used . a travel lane is a lane that is vaccinated ? how ?"
open to all country la ... easy to understand !
omicron is coming
"johntora1 thank you . we are fully vaccinated , but lots of people in switzerland don ’ t want to have the vaccine . they are afraid of loosing there freedom …. can ’ t understand this ."
open vaccinated travel lane lanes but causeway haven t open ..... wth
"becos when we have domitory covid outbreak in two thousand and twenty , they shut united states out , wahahaha"
causeway is used up to 300k commuters daily . vtls only 21k load since opening . do not be stupid .
"ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand , phils ?"
"yah , would be really keen to know the singapore government s criteria on which countries to include in the vtl"
how y ’ all know the countries aren ’ t already discussing with singapore or it is the other country that is against the vaccinated travel lane …?
ate puy india cases are so bad and they open vaccinated travel lane to them . why not other country which are safer . they have some agenda that is hidden from united states .
waynenergy indo is for maids loh
vaccination rates : total insanity
"since swiss banks are here in singapore , hence swiss are welcome . beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes"
"probably vaccinated travel lane with those countries are also because of corporate / business related , not just tourism . singapore and thailand not much businessmen traveling back and forth for corporate related reasons if not mistaken , mostly is for tourism related activities ."
not every country want to do vaccinated travel lane lane . vaccinated travel lane lane have to come upon both party in the first place .
malaysia on twenty-seven ? really ?
ate puy they only have one criteria : any country that is vaccinated with pfizer is ok to coming in regardless of their situation .
vincecarlo hah its true though . singapore are re - opening their border with countries far away from them . why ? because most asean neighbours are using sinovac and az vaccines . face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy but hey seeing what happen in germany right now i m glad they did it .
haru krentz interesting .. look what is happening now in europe - another covid surge :( european countries consider further lockdowns after another surge in covid cases - bbc news
haru krentz even if that country has very high daily cases :(
"vincecarlo indonesia currently have one of the lowest infection rate in the region , with some days positivity rate one %. few active cases remaining and icus mostly empty . in march two thousand and twenty-one serology survey showed sixty % of people in jakarta already exposed to covid . with the july - august spike and vaccinations i think we may have achieved herd immunity ( sadly at the cost of many lives lost ). our gov ’ t need to be careful because studies show immunity only last about ninety days so there ’ s risk of new wave in december - january ."
"no , it ’ s still not possible to fly from zürich to changi airport ! it ’ s unbelievable : i haven ’ t seen malaysia grandkids and malaysia family since nearly two . five years !!!"
india ? where hundreds of thousands died earlier this year ?
my suggestion is educate yourself first about current covid situation in all countries with a vaccinated travel lane status otherwise you end up embarrassing yourself with your stupidity .
"and china not even vaccinated travel lane but category one can travel without quarantine and just test , haha bruh stop being salty , let this people use vaccinated travel lane and meet their loved ones ..."
"yeah many died , you don ’ t worry jim pls take care lock ur door and rest in ur room . be safe !!!"
"wilma mohn just needs a bit more time to finalized vaccinated travel lane with rest of europe , japan etc ."
I am a student and i have not been back home in india in two years . I am glad they have opened everything up .
hope you have a safe travel .. happy to hear that
happy for you man . have a safe travel and happy reunion with your family .
yes go back india do not come back please
"ignore this negative salty dogs comments , finally we are allowed to travel and meet our family members . safe travel brother , enjoy"
"hondamugen2016 soh i hope you do not have to face such time where you cannot see your parents for more than two years because of a global pandemic coz if you did , you wouldnt survive . watch your words ."
take care and be safe
"eric km i hope very soon ! malaysia grandkids are growing so fast , haven ’ t seen them for mor than two . five years !!! it ’ s so very sad !"
hondamugen2016 soh sure bro I shall / I will take your mom along with me . need a snack for the flight anyways
"abhyudaya singhask yourself , who to blame for unable to go back earlier ? the whole world is suffering , but nobody trying to find out where virus is coming from ? very sad ."

wilma mohn thumbs_uppeople_hugging
when we are not able to stop the spread in our own country people should refrain from pointing finger at other countries . the new numbers are speaking for themselves . every country had worked hard to contain the spread some managed immediately and some after learning a hard lesson . let us support each other and let the economy grow again . our fellow citizen suffer due to no hospitality business almost closed . let us support the calculated and cautious approach by govt of singapore . if things become bad singapore govt will take necessary action .
​ joel anthony speaks volume of a person .
ako j its literally two jabs
why so selective . does this mean we also can travel to this vtlcountries if we are fully vaccinated . aany testing requirements ?
vtl means quarantine - free if you are fully vaccinated
i think one have to bear their medical fees if they are positive when back to singapore ...?
no if his status is vaccinated
great going singapore thumbs_uplight_skin_tone

two visitors in one household we also miss our gatherings with our families
cybertokyo no me too ok cos now cases spiking in south korea and germany so need to stop vaccinated travel lane cos hospital capacity overwhelmed .
when the f ... k r you govt going to let those unvac eat n go into shopping mall . since you letting india n indonesia coming in .
dr . d . fisher : because there is no difference anymore now . people have to live with it .
hmmm even when fully vaccinated there s really a culling project by the government .
moh better make boosters mandatory before this happens
"the daily moh report should include all vaccinated travel lane travellers count and all covid - nineteen cases , mild or critical for cases related to them . asap . serious !! citizen can only dine in two - now you allow twenty-one , zero m - workers to roam around freely every week ."
stupid law rite ... we singaporean from two thousand and twenty still at two and five . others can come in suka suka without quarantine later case high we singaporean affected by the rules again .
"lol you singaporeans should look at what is happening in germany right now . their cases are soaring at even worse level than a year ago , coincidence it happened after they re - opened their border with singapore ? face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy"
send all migrant workers back to their country and see what is going to happen in singapore . they are humans too . they are not slaves to lock and make them work .
ten thousand x one hundred and sixty bucks a head a day !! time to buy shares in raffles medical
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation .
"i mean it ' s nice they open up , but how would visitors from these countries feel when they can ' t dine out in a group more than two ( suppose they come as a family of three , four or more ) ? not exactly an ideal way to spend one ' s vacation . this is even if you ' re ok to bear the high cost of pcr tests to by pass quarantine ."
really ! please send a live location of sighting and let united states know where ..
"jesus would come back soon , even during the writer ’ s own lifetime . examples would be one peter four : seven ; matthew twenty-four : thirty-four ; twenty-six : sixty-four ; one corinthians ten : eleven ; one thessalonians four : fifteen – seventeen ; and one corinthians fifteen : fifty-one . did he ?"
seriously ... india . with the high potential of fake certificate and their infection numbers and death has always been fictitious . india lied and hid the fact they had the delta virus . this will destroy singapore s health system .
lost jobs . many companies closed . no bonuses . must pay car insurance . pay installment etc ... where got money to travel tankuku .
then maybe sell the car ?
those things you mentioned are exactly the reason why we should be reopening . it will create jobs .
i don ' t really think the vaccinated travel lane is meant for families who are going on holiday . it ' s more for businessmen and students at this time

"actually , there are many attractions still open in singapore that tourists can enjoy . for eg . the two integrated resorts , universal studios , zoos , museums , gardens by the bay , singapore flyer , duck tours , river cruises , food centres , etc . the dream cruises , caribbean cruises are also available for booking . only perhaps the karaoke lounges and some nightlife outlets are closed ."
we are in the right direction . step by step opening is a responsible way of opening to as to safeguard our health resources . nevertheless it will be an opening up decision by the govt . be patient

why tf are we opening up the borders while the restrictions on locals are as strict as ever ? make up ur goddamn mind ...
thumbs_upthumbs_upthumbs_up
"really unhappy to receive this news . why allow foreigners into the nation without quarrantine ? and worse yet , to allow certain migrant workers to leave for their homelands with ease , especially those whom have irrepairably tarnished the lives of singaporeans forever . there seems to be no consequences . what about the citizens whom have had their kindness taken as a weakness ? also , the goverment could do better to protect the livelihoods of its citizens by reducing foreign competition . it is most disheartening ."
"seriously , what kind of ppl ur ?"
are you high
beez then you must be low
no empathy at all in this post . which foreign worker has tarnished singapore s image ? maybe buck up and do your best rather than faulting other people .

singapore still don ' t realise that there are many breakthrough cases in countries which use mostly m - rna vaccine . letting them into spore will infect more sporeans . the wrong vaccine was chosen for spore national program and they still don ' t understand why the figures are soaring even though eighty % are fully vaccinated .

just open border between singapore and malaysia please
"for opening of gurantine free land vaccinated travel lane with malaysia , i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than fifty % of its capacity . all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings . for every private vehicles , it should only be allowed to carry not more than three paxs ( including driver will be four persons ). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated . that way , safe distancing can be maintained . should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johor bahru and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches ."

getting elected does not meant one can abuse their authority to descriminate and coerce people into experimental vaccine . yes . nothing can be done to them but this will reflect on their next election ...
"honestly majority we singapore a vaccine we follow the rules the next bosster but never end how to stop this covid nineteen . singapore have to adapt this covid , singapore will dining five people but not stays same household . what the points take bosster . if every days go up , we got another special bosster again . ?"
hippie geek raised_back_of_hand agrer
still haven t stop about this matter ...
"are the participants of the bloomberg forum a different species of humans ? why they can dine in 5s whereas locals are restricted to two . if all travellers are checked before coming to singapore , why are there still imported cases ? are there unvaccinated travellers with forged vaccination documents ? i ’ m sure there are countries where fake documents can be obtained under the table resulting in imported cases ."
social distancing everywhere . dining in for only two . everywhere distance of one . five meters between people and tables . and then the big surprise . on the singapore airlines planes there are sitting nine passengers in one row . no one . five meters distance . more then two people sitting together and eating their meals . joke right !

no_pedestrians only countries with investment in singapore will have vaccinated travel lane for now . we have enough workers for now . wait . our pm say needs six months for covid situation to improve . any companies want to invest in singapore are welcome . we will help vaccinate you and your staffs .
"why health ministry still described the surge in covid cases + death rates as ' unusually high '? the sorethumb group walking freely around in singapore are the unquarantined tourists , as : non - fully vaccinated cannot enter malls nor dine - out - locals discouraged by govt to socialise outside - locals can ' t visit loved ones in nursing home - foreign construction workers restricted from leaving their domitories"
stupid to spent billions on vaccine that don ’ t immunize people from the so call pandemic virus but little on therapeutic treatments even denialling drugs that are cheap like ivermectin that is effective .. indeed refusing to accept positive study cases like merck on the effectiveness . demonizing people even doctors who found iverm3ctin effective .
"because the government issued over united states $ 200billions of bonds ( ie debt ) ytd two thousand and twenty-one . thats more than fifty % of gdp , issued in ten months . government running out of money . but this will backfire as domestic consumption will weaken , other countries have no - travel advisories to singapore and domestic activity will slow . sheer stupidity ."

"what everyone wants to know is whether the government has been fiddling with the daily number of new covid - nineteen cases . just how on earth did the number of new cases jump from three thousand, two hundred and seventy-seven cases on twenty-six / ten / twenty-one to five thousand, three hundred and twenty-four cases on twenty-seven / ten / twenty-one then suddenly dropped back to three thousand, four hundred and thirty-two cases on twenty-eight / ten / twenty-one . please explain moh ."
what will happen to the daily cases when we open up travelling again ?
"as a task force for covid nineteen , their solution is to live with the virus . may i know what is the task force been set up by the government in the first place ? what is their objective toward this mission ? what the heck are they talking about ? five thousand plus infection as on twenty-eight / ten / two thousand and twenty-one . is this their goal ? someone said they had applied a good strategy on the convid nineteen . wow , so the five thousand plus infection and the increase number of death is the good strategy that it mean ? what the heck are they talking about . is this peoples action party government ? in the next election are they going to tell singapore that they had done a good job with the control of the covid nineteen virus ? are they going to say that without them singapore will not have a good strategy on how to deal with the virus . what the task force minister need most is a mirror and , we singaporean need is a miracle . really lol . no this time round is cry out loud without tear ."

why is there a pcr test in klia airport ? it does not make sense since a test was already conducted in s ’ pore prior to travel . the msian gov sure know how to make it difficult for travellers . poor malaysians working in s ’ pore . they have to pay a lot of money and waste so much time before they can get to see their family .

how about lockdown ? thank you . can t have so many cases floating around in the community daily . old parents and elderlys are at the most risk .
how can it be safer to open up to other countries with lower infectious when they still have infectious rate . i can understand we need to open up but this point he made is puzzeling .
quote : the opinions of one hundred men are useless if they know nothing about the subject . question : why is prof paul tambyah not heading the task force ? what do you clowns know about the virus .

based on consent ? ... well i wonder in an environment where data is not shared transparently and there coercion tactics used ... is “ consent ” of the willing and informed kind ?
he speaks yet can ’ t make any sense .
"i don t get the negative comments in these section . it is mandatory for the travelers to test negative before they arrive to singapore . even if there are some breakthrough cases , what is the big issue ?. there are already thousands of cases in singapore . if you believe in vaccination , then the only thing you should worry is when the govt grants permission to allow unvaccinated people inside the country . everyone in the world is going to get covid at some point of time . keep that in mind . just because you restrict , it is not going to stop the infection . it may delay it , but not stop it ."
keep hiding the vaccination status of the recent dead from the reporting to the public ? why the lack of transparency when people ’ s lives are on the line ? ... so disingenuous !!
big bs .. just open up to whole world to anyone is vaccinated .... if you keep using this vaccinated logic .. damn nonsense

poopermoodie isgay so what ... you want burnol
benjamin koh good luck dealing with the death penalty later .
their policies are rubbish ! if by what you say protect the unvaccinated is your priority then why allow those medically exempted to go into malls ? malaysia goodness ! aren t they the most vulnerable ?
i am surprised that he is so naive to say that vaccinated travel lane is for business but not for leisure . a common - sense people will know that all people will rush for vaccinated travel lane for all sorts of purpose . he should know this issue will happen before implementing the policy . i am worried having him leading singapore to fight covid …..
they should expect another worldwide sudden border shutdown and full lockdown effective q1 of two thousand and twenty-two due to omicron spread .
with such a high vaccination rate plus booster rate its illogical to still have restrictions . they made it look like they aren t sure of what they are doing
tell united states the plans 人算不如天算
"they use all force and regulations to control the spread of covid , but the covid case keep infect people every day , soon all the people in the world will get infected anyway , so why are they keeping use all forces and regulations to stop human freedom . if you start to count the infected people from the beginning until now , and it look like almost all people in the world already got infected ."
they need money . that s why .
any money cannot bring into the grave pouting_face
nowadays why the chicken chicken are not not healthy to eat .. chicken has been cared well by poultry farmers and government . if i m not wrong every three months once vaccine for improve immune systems of chicken . small doubt ..thinking_face
"orange county firefighters service are suing orange county government . an attorney for the group filed a motion on oct . one asking for an emergency injunction to block the county from requiring employees to submit to unwanted vaccinations . employees say they were at first told that they ’ d be fired if they didn ’ t take the vaccines . later , the county changed the plan to issuing written reprimands , employees said . the department would not have been able to provide services properly if there was a sudden loss of five hundred employees , about thirty-eight percent of the department . looks like all those empty threat backfire once people all stand up together !"
wake me up when we can travel to malaysia or china without quarantine
their problem .
"because singapore govt can only control its own ppl , not those foreigners who are coming to spend $$$. and since riches in singapore don t pay taxes , you need to open up for small ppl to go back to work , pay taxes / cpfs so govt has money to spend . or how to pay two million usd to each of those officials ?"
indonesia cut covid by ninety-eight % with lver mectin while australia grew cases five hundred % with lock - n - vax
"last month , indonesian president joko widodo stated that the national bed occupancy rate ( abbreviated as bor ) of indonesian hospitals had fallen below thirty percent , a ridiculously low number considering the national bor averages around sixty-five percent in normal circumstances ."
"dear friends .. i have gone throw some of your comments . already minister is explained why reopening borders with more countries . i am going to add a bit . every country has to survive with live and livelihood together . it can ’ t leave livelihood for a long times . the country will be getting permanent disable for long years of shut down the borders . that ’ s why need to open more countries for well being and survive singapore . not just shut down the border for more years where the truth is that we have to live with covid . this truth is not for singapore only , it is universal now . we have to learn from other countries also how they reconnecting and opening border with other countries . and pls note that only vaccinated people are allowed to enter in singapore . as i believe that there is nothing different for the antibody of vaccinated severity between singaporean and other country people , is same . so why we are getting shock when border opening for vaccinated only . if we look to europe , we can understand why mtf has decide to reopen . is there any of malaysia friend can help to share the timeline that when will be the perfect and suitable time to reopen singapore borders to save life and livelihood . we have to reopen in a day . isn ’ t it ? of course to save life is first priority than livelihood . also note please there are most of the cases are mild or no symptoms even covid positive because of highly vaccinated . and some of people need oxygen supplementation and icu because of severe disease and seniors who hasn ’ t been vaccinated or partially vaccinated . few are fully vaccinated . currently in singapore"
dear mamun so now can you explain the logic why restaurant cannot play music but gymn can play music ? so what has music got to do with covid infection ?
china is already without quarantine from last year
the singapore government has finally yielded to allowing sinovac to be accepted as a legitimate vaccine as it acknowledges that there are people who are wary about messenger rma vaccine long term side effect . i applaud to singapore government s honesty to deal with this issue based on scientific knowledge and not political considerations .
they should also allow ivermectin . india controlled their delta peak using ivermectin .
is not it too late for everything or too soon for something ?
"the pandemic came and taught everyone the importance of having multiple stream of income , unfortunately having a nice paying job doesn t mean you are financially secure anymore . so we all need to put in an extra - income earning chance , like investments ."

"maulik madhavi not true . i was quarantine for fourteen days in shanghai last year but this year , they require fourteen + seven days home quarantine which means twenty-one days in hotel for foreigners like united states . unfortunately , it is still in force right now ."
how can you compare a bicycle to the lives of humans ??? judging by the comments seems like no regards for human lives
why money
it does not make sense . the whole point for reduced social gathering groups and dining in is to reduce human traffic ? so what reasons can they use to justify bringing more people into the streets of singapore ? can t have it one way and contradict it almost immediately
"even if they are so desperate to open border , stick to the current fourteen days quarantine at facilities . we do not need these ppl spread the virus at community area . travellers are now desperate to get out of their country too especially for work permit between malaysia and singapore . they can conveniently make an entry . for those travellers from europe and rest of asian countries if they can come here , meaning they have the means to pay for it apart from paying insurance . rather than put restriction on the citizen and let loose these ppl ."
$$$ very easy logic . isn t singapore policy mostly base on it ?
"did you listen to the whole video ? foreigners are tested rigourously before they come into singapore , it is now the local community that has more infections . livelihoods are at stake now . singapore need some tourists to boost the economy ."
"alzario foreigners are tested rigourously before they come into singapore , it is now the local community that has more infections . livelihoods are at stake now . singapore need some tourists to boost the economy ."
indonesians also want to come but the government has to postpone the travel bubble after a surge of cases in the nearby city state ..
"​ vanessa loh i would think having more bodies in our infectious local community means a higher rate of infection . vaccinated or not , they can still be carriers . it just seems kinda counter intuitive to have the community be placed under restriction but have tourist coming in . pick a direction and go with it . the whole talk about endemic just seems to have gone nowhere . the video doesn t even answer the question on why there are inconsistencies between these policies . it just admits that there are inconsistencies and ask united states to live with it . maybe if proper planning was in place when this whole thing started , then the economy would be in a better place ."
"if you are so good , we would not have seen a big spike in cases and burden our healthcare right now . hello ! we are ranked among tops in most infected nation right now . stop pretending that we did well compared to other countries . no one look behind . just open your small eyes and see the present state now !"
our neighbour indonesia doing really well now despite only having twenty-four % full - vacc rate . do you know their secret ?

"would it come a day where they require everyone to take a booster shot every six months to be considered vaccinated ? will they force united states ? why personal health is taken by the authority ?? it is scary to be living in a world where you do not have control of your health . if you don t take booster , you are considered not vaccinated ? are we going in that direction ? what about the long term side effects of frequent booster shots ? who is going to be responsible for the long term effects ? how come nobody questions ?"
our neighbour indonesia doing really well now despite only having twenty-four % full - vacc rate . do you know their secret ?
"singapore is the greatest joke of the entire asia . if you can t battle the war alone , at least listen to your foot soldiers feebacks , suggestions and concerns . was it difficult to ask ? constantly asking singaporeans to stay united and you completely leave united states out of the equation in dealing with pandemic and forced united states to listen to your warped excuses ."
all these naggers and complainers are foot soldiers ? listen to them and the whole country will perish in no time . this is why we need wise leaders such as the current mtf ministers . the decisions may not be popular to some but they are made in the interest of the country
"all these vaccinated lanes are blowing hot air only . just look at the number of airplanes sitting on the tarmac can see . just look at the number of pilots on no pay leave can see . just look at the people getting in and out of changi airport can see . trying to discriminate against the unvaccinated , you received tribulation ."

majority of foreign workforce in singapore are from your neighbouring asean countries esp malaysia and philippines yet you are not opening borders from them considering singapore has higher cases per day . but you are open with countries such as united kingdom which is now living with covid . what ’ s the difference of a vaccinated brit with a vaccinated person in asean ? the problem with the government is lack of empathy and logic .

"there ’ s one thing that i still do not understand . for a long time before sep our case nos . were very low in double digits . then the govt announced “ living with covid ” and suddenly our cases spiked to four digits . but if you look at the imported cases they still remain very low , in double digits even till today . so malaysia question is where did all these new local cases originate from ?? did our testing fail to detect infected persons coming in at the border ? or did we detect them but still let them loose onto the population assuming that since we are eighty-five % vaxxed that nothing bad will happen ? or more sinisterly , did moh deliberately massage the numbers of imported cases into local cases with justification that they are prs returning from overseas ? bear in mind that throughout this time our social restrictions have never eased , in fact they were tightened significantly . this is a big logic gap that the govt ’ s narrative so far has failed to address ."
the cases spiked when they gave vaccinated ppl false confidence . it started since ndp 21st august where discrI amination towards unvaxxed started . vaccinated ppl have quietly been super silent spreaders . I am pissed at their mistakes everytI ame . it has caused both malaysia parents to be at hospital now .
"it is malaysia twenty years experience , so take this thing seriously . the doctors will never recommend you this thing because they don s get ready to do so . ) i have lived the hell of pneumonia and inflammation so far . and the doctors prescribed me only things those were , antibiotic . they prescribed me more strong antibiotics when the first one stopped working . when all the antibiotics stopped working i had no way but controlling malaysia eating habits to control the severe inflammation and excessive mucus problems . because ayurveda described this thing . it is a natural thing to treat pneumonia and inflammation with no side effects . ."
i thought uncle joe advised united states tourists not to travel to singapore because of the high number of covid cases even among the vaccinated ? he changed his mind because that will destroy the theory that vaccination works ?!
because singapore looks up to the gwei lo . what united kingdom and united states are doing must be scientifically proven and correct .
"if singapore is considered by united states n germany as the place with the highest risk rating . it is foolish n naive to open up travel to countries with lower risk than singapore . it is prudent to lower singapore s risk rating before opening up travel , if using the criteria of allowing travel from lower risk countries ."
"its a choice , not mandatory , why suddenly sound not a part of citizen anymore . its a choice to take other jab as well even before covid appear , does tat mean as long whoever din take any jab will have to bear every cost on own even the gov had taken aside cpf contributions , taxes etc from every citizen . so have you taken every single jab tat is a available in the world or in singapore ? again vaccination is a choice , it shouldn t get any discrimination , unfairness or punishment to bear cost etc at all . its only a failure that the gov or the world failed to convince those not getting vac . trust is involve ."

"his argument is flawed . the vaccinated travel lane only started this week ( excluding germany / brunei ), of course the imported cases are still low . but give it time , the imported cases will rise and spread to the community and singaporeans who have been following the rules are the ones who suffer . pls be consistent in your policies . if borders are open , then singaporeans should be allowed to gather in groups of more than two . there ’ s currently one standard for the rich and expats ( they can afford to travel with families and return without quarantine ) and another standard for average singaporeans ."
now our cases are high if they dare to come let them come la what is the big deal ?
ah choon big deal . because they keep talking about hospital and icu being overwhelmed right now . these people coming in will contribute to the community spread ( perhaps we will hit five thousand to seven thousand cases a day ) which means more people will end up in the hospitals and icu . they will use this excuse to introduce more restrictions . who suffers in the end ? ordinary singaporeans like united states .

what is the vacination earliest date as cut off are we allowing ppl in ?
"its clear their endemic , stay with covid had failed and singapore is back with more restriction . now is damage control . nothing wrong to admit mistakes instead of blaming and discriminate unvax ."
is this reciprocal opening of vaccinated travel lane or just one sided from united states ? can we travel to those eight countries under same arrangement ?
"vaccine mandate is a dark global agenda , you are naive to think that the vaccine differentiation is a domestic decision / blame game"
nothing says about these restrictions haha
vance kang they have their legitimate reason and they pay taxes too . even unvax that had survive covid had better immunity than vax . there are people that had medical reason too . ... you are one narrow minded person .
j i they claim endemic but sire they failed to later implement more restriction .
justfair theres nothing to be painful when one had done no wrong ? its the person that create bad karma that will eventually be painful when the time comes .

"justfair you must be living in a cave , peoples action party ib . thatz all the peoples action party tasked you to do - uttering nonsense ?"
would you have a better solution ? the suggestion box is wide open
the flight ticket is considered cheap compared to pre covid festival season ticket .
joe kerr there s a reason why they are ministers and you are here whining away :)

"speaking during a press conference on saturday , transport minister s iswaran said the vaccinated travel lanes would restore ' two - way quarantine - free travel ' between singapore and the eight newly announced countries . as per channel news asia article"
joe kerr would that be a euphemistically similar to what your wife tells you ?
"m l hey it ’ s their job not ours , if we have better suggestions , would you go and kick them off ? look at the stats , singapore now is the one of the most risky countries to contract covid !"
jhyapril risky by what measure ? re just a pathetic keyboard warrior :)
onky living with covid ever changing restrictions .
ah choon chasing after $$$$$ and killing the seniors at the same time !
"yes , you can go on tour to these countries ."

wake up singapore . the new citizens are truly obligated since citizenship been granted to them .
justfair young or old does not matter . next generation will suffer more !!!
kloppo melwood do some reading to be smarter .
kloppo melwood the citizens from a certain country in south asia is just using singapore as a stepping stone to the west !
"who are the ones not getting their pay , the companies are not getting the business , people are not spending their money , no money for workers salary . want singapore to print money and give out , like the united states ?"
how are they playing with people s lives ? can you explain for malaysia understanding please . thank you very much
how long you can stand this type lifestyle ?
welcome anyone in the world to test their covid resistance in one of the world ' s most covid cases .
lee hsien loong should step down to be honest . his father lee kuan yew wouldnt accept the way things are progressing . the current batch of ministers lack foresight .

abcde zero blame less may be helpful to you
justfair you cannot get a decent job outside ? why resort to shilling as a peoples action party ib for a pittance ? is that how you bring food to the table ?
deep one and stop thinking that you have liberty to post all the falsehoods like you could in toc .
justfair liar ! toc is not malaysia cup of tea la . no wonder yr world is so small . can prove you are able get a decent job other than a shameless peoples action party ib tasked to patrol gvt sites ? cannot right ?
abcde zero lee hl does not need to step down as he will see his father in the 18th level hell soon

"justfair are you sure that it is ok to report death everyday ? only you and the peoples action party are ok with it , but not we . please , next time think first when you write in the post , that is not the way to support the peoples action party by saying it is ok with the death number compare with the other country . peoples action party supporter nowadays , really low standard , this type of comment , you can write it . are you a representative for peoples action party ?"
justfair wow .! you really look like the person who like to brat about himself for applying good strategy on covid nineteen .
"come on , tell united states the truth about vaccinated travel lane , tell united states which companies , countries have lobbied for reopening . the government is willing to do this despite rising number of cases everyday and at the expense of your healthcare workers , we should at least know who is going to benefit from this . and please stop saying that your measures are there to relieve stress on the healthcare system , because they clearly aren s amazing how someone can say this with such conviction on national television then go on and do something totally opposite , what a politician ."
"err the six new south asia countries added like will have only workers and students coming in . if they confident to bring more worker , ease restricition for united states also ."
"alnir zaly should be temasek or gic has shares , in order to secure the vaccine supply for singapore . so we can get it before other countries which we did . other countries gov also invested in vaccine companies . the vaccine is not that useful is another matter . don t think any ministers personally have share in pz , like you mention that would be conflict of interest , pocketing profit from this person_gesturing_NOperson_gesturing_NO female_sign person_gesturing_NO male_sign"
then the unvaccinated and the seniors will be more restricted in times to come . they will be punished more severely as more vtls are welcomed with open arms
"eric phua bloomberg already announced temasek has invested . now who ’ d know if respective individuals wouldnt be tempted to make a good buck from this . i ’ m not saying they are but if they did , citizen lives would appear so so cheap , if it ’ s not already ."
"alnir zaly . sigh **, they all from good school , should know what is right , what is wrong . maybe we do need to worry so much . i am hoping mr ong beef up the hospital capacity since now gate open , maybe increase in cases later on ."
alnir zaly grinning_face_with_sweatthumbs_up
"if vtls are in group of more than two people , think they are free to move about and dine in , right ?"
"latin_cross thirteen billion, two hundred and thirty-eight million, four hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and eighty-seven"

wow all scammers come together . allow me to report all of you to the authorities . better upgrade your firewall .
"in singapore , virus start to slowly disappear , why they suddenly virus so much . we are just a small island with sea on all sides ."
because we eat with five people instead of two
justfair did you flip flatbread on this . last time you say not due to this reason .person_shrugging now you say is due to this .
thanks for sharing
"if you cannot lift up the restriction then opening travel lane is not an option , all the small and medium enterprises is suffering with even tighter measures and you brainlessly opening up for more country , you boast to have the highest vaccinated population in the world and everything else is way behind those country . your vision is pretty bad as you only see what is good for your gain and many people is unemployed here as this people does local people business in heart land and have no benefits from your stupid travel lane opening . they won ’ t died of covid by will die of hunger ."
go back to bounty hunting please . don t complain so much . :)
it is simple actually when you use your logic . people who goes to a gym is one hundred % healthy people . while people who goes to a restaurant are not
one is enjoying the other is suffering cannot tahan just close restaurants and open gyms so simple why be so entitled ? if you so smart why not join peoples action party ?
r tim f b hawker and all food outlet us are daily essential cos people need to eat and its considerable to play light music to soothe the atmosphere while gymn seems non essential for the general public especially for the kids and elderly also anyone can workout at home with own music played on or do it outdoor while enjoy the bird singing in the nature so let us be logical about what people really need essentially during this pandemic crisis .
boba fett sorry but when did hawker centre have music ? soothing music is used to charge high prices for atmosphere which isn t essential as most singaporean cannot afford those atas places
do not vote peoples action party .
suggestion : singaporean coming back to home country should get a free or a subsidised hotel accommodation . limit to once or twice a year .
"boba fett ya sure atas restaurants are non essential best is to close shop and open fast food restaurant and play radio if you think you can , rather than sulking in social media"
r tim its not about sulking or fretting on social media but its all about giving a constructive feedback on how to lay out a concrete measures that are seamless and simple to all to understand cos music makes the people come together but food makes everyone come closer to civilisation .
boba fett obviously this pandemic they do not want people to come together . they want people to reduce interaction work from home restrict group size and having soft music in atas food places only makes people stay longer . even ktv is banned . do not compare apples and oranges
r tim then do not compare durian with chempedak cos simply if do not want people to come together then why there are rallies and award variety shows and parade and also millions of people commuting on public transport and above ninety % population living in hdb and condos and is not that already close enough and tell me now is mata kuching and longan are the same ?
wow ! 160th - ranked by reporters without borders channel news asia took less than fifteen sec to delete malaysia comments
that s the only thing they are good at .
"andylau google reporters without borders . st just deleted malaysia posts again - one linked , another an explanation to google . contemptible and disgusting shitty paper ."
deep one ok thank you folded_hands grinning_face_with_big_eyes
bell198000 another peoples action party ib spotted ! wow ! peoples action party has released a pack of fierce hyenas on the public !
i am still confused .. sitting with strangers in a train or bus and yet i cannot sit next to malaysia closest of friends ... this is utter nonsense !
"if not seriously I shall / I will until needs to go icu , they got no time to care also . all ownself take care ownself . that mr . ong home recovery ."
"with the new one - two - three health protocol , you won no test = no case ! what a brilliant mtf !"
"eric phua if not seriously I shall / I will and you go hospital , you are actually exposing yourself to more infection risks . hospitals full of germs ."
kclee hospital also can t handle more people now . not dying one all home recovery rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
wow banned dining and malls for unvax is not enough . coming soon on 1st jan . banned from going back to workplaces . so how are the citizens of singapore going to survive and live ? yet they say the vaccine is not mandatory .
"china can ’ t look to singapore for a way to live with covid - nineteen , health economist says . - singapore ’ s “ experiment ” to live with the coronavirus – and its subsequent spike in infections – might not be a useful model for china . “ this safety net protecting the health of one . four billion people did not come easily . we can ’ t let it go just like that ,” li ling , from peking university ’ s national school of development ."
there are already more than one hundred + sub - lineages of the delta variants to greet the singaporeans soon ! the most dangerous are delta + e484k or delta + e484q because these mutations can evade the antibodies and the body immune system .
thankfully i have malaysia bags packed and ready to go soon .
"malaysia government still don ' t want , but johor royal is pushing already"
hmmmm what happened to the “ light at the end of the tunnel ” … it ’ s not coming ?
we are expecting e headlight of the coming train .
next up on comedy central .
"vaccine for children , how we know it safe ? mr ong ."
"we don ’ t at all , they want to cover their asses , it ’ s time for opposition to show they are better than pap"
"let children jab you scare , dun let them jab also scare . sigh ... another overdosed parents"
"j . lai wow ! gov cannot like that say , old man like die nevermind , childrens how can suka suka . they still so young ."
"well singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cov ! d response , and harsh restrictions . maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity ? cnn / united states cdc places singapore in highest travel risk for cov ! d ; fox bbc - looks at situation with migrant worker dorms . latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct 24th ."
irrelevant . allowing msians in provide no beneficial to singapore ' s economy .
the question is why is he in the task force when he is not a infectious doctor . they sound as if they are real doctor
they are stooges .
"as film director always said . have you memorise the script ? okay , take one action !!! face_with_tears_of_joy"
i will say it will take another year and i believe there is a new variant soon
covid nineteen shown that it is more resistance . more mutations of virus . haha let s see a new variant
isn t what we doing . we are doing crazy measure to allow home recovery and let the virus spread in community
i cannot wait for delta plus e484k or e484q to pay singapore a visit ... then we will talk !
"on oct . nineteen , the bill and melinda gates foundation announced that it would be setting aside one hundred and twenty million dollars to ensure merck ’ s experimental coronavirus disease two thousand and nineteen ( covid - nineteen ) drug , molnupiravir , is made available to people in lower - income nations . merck ’ s drug is aimed at combating mild to moderate covid - nineteen cases . no wonder all of a sudden , all the mainstream media were boasting about this super pill . very powerful background obviously ."
"blizzaroxxx your ignorance is astounding . malaysia is one of the top contributor for your tourism . may you not know , those millionaires from malaysia , indonesia and china love spending money in singapore .. lol"
country run by a bunch of economists ! all singing from the same hymn $$$$$ heet !
these ministers from which school huh ?
singaporeans are being experimented with ...
"by mainly economists like lw , ong ye kung , ccs"
i run a chain of eateries . can malaysia companies refuse entry to those tt took the chinesium vaccine ?
i oppose to many of the tf s live and let live . heaven got eyes .
not easy but keep on going minister . many things could be done better but singaporeans will not realise how lucky we are to have this leadership .
these newly opened vaccinated travel lanes are like the salad bar in a buffet .. no one cares and makes no difference .
"this rush to open borders for the south asians , malaysia and indonesia is just waiting for another disaster to happen !"
forgot something : it ’ s called mutations
"yes , the health minister is clueless about healthcare . the only credibility he has is being in the peoples action party ."
xian seah that was during lky times . now being in the peoples action party is seen as mercenary .
"even with four thousand cases a day , how long does it take for the stabilisation minister ong is talking about ? if we do the math , it will take one thousand days for 4mil to be infected and have as stated in his speech . that is three years , not three - 6months . whether we ease measures now , 3months later or six months later , infections will still rise . we either bite the bullet sooner or later , unless we are willing to wait 3years . but it is simply not feasible to remain in this semi - lockdown state for so long . we have to move on ."
"what if more than four thousand , somewhere like 10k . just hope covid death don t spike too much . pity the medical workers who have to deal with this ."
most impt question : why do voters like to elect stupid idiots to lead singapore to more deaths .
pap haven t control a natural disaster like a pandemic like they could singaporeans . their schedule might work for forcing singaporeans to adhere to policies but the virus is omnipotent and omnipresent .
jesus is coming back to earth to resolve everything . repent .
"eight continues can cme here spread , but we got no chance to spread , sounds fair to singapore ministers fucxxx , fuxx off don ' t talk please , tell united states something to make united states happy"
"haha , you better go to heaven"
no he s not . you better do something about it yourself .
the 4th mass extinction is already in the making ... coming soon to a theatre near you ...
progressing ? with more deaths . insisting on living with covid is right approach . no logic .
"the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with vco / lauric acid , and total community viral load can be lowered , do not play dice with covid , try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time ."
hey you idiots .... how many more seniors do you want to kill ???
"singapore is young man , young blood , fresh creative idea country . old man , old idea , old method old car , old etc ... not allowed except politicians zipper-mouth_face"
excellent speech by minister iswaran cos indeed we need to open such vaccinated travel lane for united states united kingdom canada europe country and possibly australia and new zealand to boost our economy
do not kpkb when it goes up to ten thousand
"hospital capacity don t allow that much cases , they can just just report max five thousand no matter what are number . the rest do home recovery , close one eye . have to see daily death cases ."
"aiyo , no need so many measure one , people still going out , mall so crowded everyday , queuing so long haha , is ok , no problem , many seem like care about those vulnerable , but body very honest , every day whole family jalan jalan fill out the mall ."
"if shopping mall no traffic , you will needs to bring in even more tourists to shop . or all shipping mall close shop ? what do you want ?"
thank you minister ong for your status report on the covid nineteen situation in singapore . it gives united states confidence knowing the task force s thinking in leading united states to become a covid - nineteen resilient nation .
i hope you have parents and grandparents above sixty +....
and children who cannot take the vaccines
they have gone mad !
is it one way in singapore only or two ways ? malaysian can go back malaysia visit famaily ? indonesian can travel back indonesia ?
"haha you apparently you don ' t listen to the news about financial oifficulties in united states , united kingdom , australia , canada . indonesian business people are much more wealthier . perhaps in your mind , americans are bill gates , mark zuckerberg , verawang , elon musk , face_with_tears_of_joyface_blowing_a_kissface_with_tears_of_joy well these people think big , they go to monaco , switzerland , luxemburg not singapore ."
really a mangkock comparing tiny singapore island with those country he mention grinning_face

welcome to the new world order
"no normalcy will come . we will have to be vaccinated every six months for life because that is the agenda . and the future vaccines will likely be paid from our medisafe . the shots will become more and more expensive . whether we take the shots or resist them , our money will still be deducted . this is malaysia theory for what is to come . i hope i am wrong ."
they vexsinate you continuously all bible prophecies are coming to pass quickly !!
"i quote him , just like the life of a human being , it surely end what . what has / what is important is when and how . doctors analyse and can estimate how long and how a person may pass away if there is an adverse medical condition . this analysis of the government and rather redundant statements does somehow show we are just waiting for everybody to get infected . if thats the plan , might as well get this over with and forgo all restrictions ."
"o . two % of five mI shall / I willions wI shall / I will be seriously I shall / I will and require icu bed , fifty % wI shall / I will not make it ? is the number right , worrying ."

open vtls so foreigners have privileges but restrictions for citizens . source - st twenty-five oct twenty-one
vincecarlo all alone what they doing - giving to the foreigner instead of own people .
i think he has some right points 。 i had very hard times as caregiver for malaysia hb home recovery . i end up hospital now . we need to move forward ! after vaccine in may malaysia hb got covid on eleven oct twenty-one 。 now we look forward for 3rd covid vaccine then travel overseas two thousand and twenty-two . no perfect policies and i know elderly die . malaysia own mum still not hv vaccine in overseas because no children dare to let her to be vaccine . let ’ s god mercy for all eldery .
more vtls means better days for frontline workers like tour guides and healthcare workers .
another mushroom !
beneifit to get stronger virus beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
why ??? really ? because our corrupt officials are looking after their wallets while letting united states die bebecause of this clowns bad decisions of letting foreigners in throughout the whole process while keeping united states locked in .
now lord of brakes and rings too sleeping_facesleeping_facesleeping_facesleeping_facesleeping_face
"it ’ s all about breaking your spirit and making you fall in line . slowly but surely , and at a pace that everyone isn ’ t even noticing it … compare now to a year ago when we had no deaths and only a fraction of these restrictions . the vaccine causes mutations and spread . but hey , let ’ s get another booster jab for a vaccine which already mutated and doesn ’ t help !"
wow what an analogy ... i thought if you have a couple of redbulls ride down fast enough ... you can .....
analogy is for stupid people to understand complex problems
what about malaysia which have very high vaccinated rates now ?

"is it also against nature that germany , russia and united kingdom are having a new wave now ? nature dictates that organisms adapt to survive , and covid mutates to survive with every new person it infects . living with covid only gives covid a much higher chance to adapt to our current vaccines and antibodies . you can ’ t be sure that we will live with one hundred - two hundred cases a day in the future because it is not happening anywhere else in the world . russia , united kingdom and germany are showing you your future path ."
"if drive a shared electric car and no wear mask on this shring car is that getting the covid virus ? who know the past shring drive have virus or not on the road can see a lot . moh , lta need to check it . is that were spread the virus . went the car no clean up and no wear mask to drive this sharing car ??"
"you got your brake on your bicycle , but don t have one meter safe distance in all buses and train .. than you may come out and say whatever you want .."
you saying right . for me covid rule not logic . bus . mrt . so crowded every morning can see many people touching each other . so funny
very hard to be ministers during covid storm folded_handsSingapore
you seldom get second to breathe ....................!
high vaaxxed higher deaths and infection rates too ..... nooooooo
unfortunately it wouldn ve proven to singaporeans their resolve not in handling the crisis but in pleasing their overlord
pls get a better grp in the mtf they r simply asking the public doing bussinesses to change if you cannot survive tru this pandemic but there is no improvement to this grp of people wat should we do
please sack them . for the sake of singapore .
schadenfreude petition god for capable leaders .
schadenfreude that is insulting singapore s education system
schadenfreude .. your family will tke over k .
do not vote peoples action party .
schadenfreude i do not know until you tel me .. grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes
samson no delilah how about united states ? covid case and death higher than malaysia
"before its was max group of five , then group of five fully vaccinated , now group of five fully vaccinated from the same household if r rate smaller then one . what has / what is next ? booster shot required ? no more restrictions now !!!"
"we mass vaccinated , tightened restrictions to more than we had over a year ago , and we manage to get thousands of daily cases and a dozen daily deaths . makes you wonder if the vaccine and restrictions because this . there ’ s no other explanation for it ."
"destroyer74 , i t follow restrictions anymore as well as a year ago ..."
i would say either make up their minds to properly fight covid or just bloody give up . either open up fully or shutdown fully for a good one to three months and clean house then open up to covid safe countries . constant flipping and then flopping on your collective peoples action party face isn t exactly the way promote confidence in our leaders
destroyer74 more n more restrictions only show ineffectiveness . it ’ s a very factual issue .
"well singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cov ! d response , and harsh restrictions . maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity ? cnn / united states cdc places singapore in highest travel risk for cov ! d ; fox bbc - looks at situation with migrant worker dorms . latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct 24th ."
bible prophecies are coming true . the mark of the beast is here . those who take the vampire juice will meet a fate worse than death .
who will want to come singapore with such high numbers of daily cases ?
"non of these four are health experts , they never mentioned the long term health effects due to infections , they never mentioned who s suggestion on pandemic is still at the highest level"
we all know that and i ’ m sure they know but it doesn ’ t change the fact that like it or not the infections will spread .
"these are highly educated scholars with proven track record , who spent endless time and effort to figure out how to solve this problem , which is not easy at all"
"kenneth mak is the only one with health background . but he is being too quiet and ignorant , he should resign"
the previous doc minister of malaysia said spanish fly . how like that ? grinning_face_with_sweat
alnir zaly that ’ s different country which we shan ’ t compare with . ours are different . top elite scholars with track proven leadership skill . they are the most hardworking ministers and singaporeans should rightfully be very grateful
do not vote peoples action party .
"they failed to publicise that singapore govt and glcs issued over 200bil usd in debt ytd two thousand and twenty-one , vs less than 20bil last year . govt running out of money hence the panicked headless chicken approach over the last few months ."
ychong ong lol good luck with that
ychong ong well said thumbs_upthumbs_up
wah very surprise ong knew delta is very transmissable !!!
face_with_tears_of_joy
is a joke that singapore is so unstabilised with high eighty-five % vac now but all the 3rd world countries has been stabilised for quite some time and allowing the influx of this ft .
"two brakes need to be applied and for those who want to use the delta variant as an excuse , the first case was reported in october two thousand and twenty . way before our first vaccination ."
might be nato military forces
"all the strategies are not working . in this stage to break the spreading , government should implement two weeks fully locked down followed by another two weeks restriction for example working from home mandatory during restrictions . fully one month , the nation can overcome this situation ."
"there is no strategy . it ’ s reacting to various issues without careful thinking , and lousy execution . i do think lockdown is beyond united states now . i ’ ve always advocated lockdown but we need to know how to handle a lockdown …. i don ’ t think the government knows how , going by how they screwed up without being tight . and maybe that ’ s why they want to open up - so that they can find excuses and do not need to handle the groundwork . anyway , with everybody basically spreading to everybody now , the practicalities of a lockdown are probably impossible for united states to handle ."
"we mass vaccinated and only now we have thousands of daily cases and a dozen dying each day . yeah , that can ’ t be caused by the vaccines right ? i can only say thank you for protecting the unvaccinated from the vaccinated . i will be refusing any regular nasal testing , and if i ’ m not allowed to wfh next year , it ’ s bye job and bye singapore ."
we have achieved more than eighty % herd immunity but yet we are still dealing with this mess and thats confusing .
thumbs_up
"i unable to blame the peoples action party government now , i can only blame the sixty % that voted them ,"
minority blaming the majority is normal in this country sorry you suffered
i can only blame the pandemic exist in the world
actually there with votes to ensure they sill stay on top .
"i was planning to come ( from hong kong ), but malaysia singaporean friends advised me to postpone , as we won ' t be able meet up easily at home nor dine out ."

philip audio other countries want also don t cry lah . understand your problem
philip audio oh thank you . you are better behaved than your flocks . i am okay too .
next ge we ll see if they will still have sixty % vote .
they have made a number of mistakes indeed . but to be honest i don ’ t see the opposition doing better or having better solutions as well . we need stronger politicians .
every wise soul knows how they win the ge for decades ...

"you never know until you see the numbers . the german vaccinated travel lane flights have impressive load factors . many westerners are already living without masks , drinking beer while cheering at jam - packed socker stadiums and clubbing like there is no tomorrow . you still think the covid case numbers are the deciding factors whether they come ? it has always been the protocols that are the deterrent , never the case counts ."

then you don t sit in mrt loh ... stand in mrt . simple
marx which is more important in preventing covid spread .. wear mask or wash hands ?
daphnemaia how dumb can someone be . most cases are infected in public and work places . even hospital with stricter regulations have been a cluster . are these ppl not wearing mask when moving around ? with or without mask anyone can get infected especially in public transport . ever heard of the news before or just be ignorant .
buy a bentley if you cannot take the public transport lol !
i still can t mandatory for vaccination makes more sense ?
the measures affect everyone . vaccinated persons can only hang out in groups of two too . mandatory vaccination might not be possible since the vaccines are only approved for emergency / pandemic uses .

chy nah big brother cannot offend
why singapore opening boarders ? easy . don ’ t see you opening boarders to 3rd world countries eh ? their currency too small to entice you ?
"did not they just announce opening borders to bangladesh , pakistan , india , myammar etc etc earlier today ? hardly 1st world countries ."
"if singapore citizens go out and come back to singapore is not restricted , the restrictions only other than singaporean . this also will affect the spreading of virus ."
"gerald lim think … ceca , foreign workers working for subana , temasek … all about money so any liability is only its people n national funds , expect many tax increase ."
opening is definitely in line with global order . we are not north korea
well there are many coming in .
"gerald lim . so for ceca in singapore , can they go back and visit their famaily in india and come back ? or one way in to singapore only . did india ban singapore too ?"
"gerald lim i have had enough of this denigrating attitude towards india and indians . historically , the term 3rd world refer to the countries that neither allied with the united states nor with the soviet block . by that logic , singapore is a 3rd world country too - as it was non - aligned . maybe you forgot the state of singapore in the 70s and 80s . the prosperity to singapore came only after it opened up to the world and its advantageous location in the malacca strait . in india , only a few sectors have been opened up so far e . g . it and software services . yet , india is advanced enough to develop nuclear weapons and send satellites to mars and moon . india even launched a satellite for singapore as well a few years back if i remember correctly . so , thumbs down to your snobby attitude ."

you can police the people but not the virus the first step towards for progress .
"singapore : one hundred and sixty , zero cases ; two hundred and eighty deaths ( population five . seven mil ); two . eight % ha ha ha !"
yea ..thumbs_up you are absolutely correct
"to begin with , they ’ re huge , it is likely many have / had covid but go / went undetected . additionally , it ’ s china . they tried to silence doctors who warned about the virus . how can you possibly think those numbers are accurate and reflective of the real situation in china ?"
"china is big . their economy can sustain a prolonged closure because of strong internal demand , that s why they can afford to do that . singapore relies heavily on the rest of the world , that why we must open up . go back to your jc economics lessons and stop spouting nonsense"
"i think singapore is a rare developed nation that can screw up so badly , be so dumb and yet pat ourselves on our back saying we damn solid and allow people to be infected and die without conscience . uniquely singapore ."
"time it takes for china to snuff out an outbreak of covid with strict and intense tracing and testing policy is roughly ten to twelve days . precisely like you peoples action party lovers have claimed , china is large and singapore larger ? because it s success and agree with the disinformation campaign by western govs and ours . take a look at all the social media sources about life in china now . or is that too much to expect out of you ."
"m l no ah . united states did the same thing under trump , singapore just following the example like a pathetic groupie for the united states . economy first , people 2nd , when people die of covid create excuses and pretend they died due to underlying conditions as though it wasn t exacerbated by covid , hence covid because of death . but what to do lky was the goat but lee hsien loong and his cronies are nothing but money grubbing , entitled prats ."
z bz you are correct ! china doesn t need so many foreign workers compared to singapore .
omg just open already if you wanna open borders !! jesus
prefer to lockdown and contain the virus from spreading further everyday . too many unlink cases .
"apparently it ’ s ok to test people entering and exiting singapore , but do you think they ’ ll bother testing all the residents ? i ’ ve never been tested and that ’ s perfectly fine , because healthy people shouldn ’ t be ! they purposely test 30k people daily to get so many false positives . it ’ s fudging the statistics . the reality is there ’ s only forty sick people a day , the ninety-eight . seven % of others either aren ’ t sick , or don ’ t have covid . art tests aren ’ t very accurate ."
lisa lim yup pple from 3rd world that carry new mutated virus .
"vinicius voon what a clueless response , do you know singapore has hundreds of thousands of flu patients every year , and we have eight hundred and fifty-five flu related deaths ? do you see the govt peddling flu vaccines ? locking down singapore ? it ’ s time to stop listening to media lies …"
"if you open six more countries , why local still have all these restricitions . what is the purpose ?"

"use the same analogy that every six person is someone that knows united states how lame , infection will go up or now depend on the evolution of the virus if you want to talk about nature , when environment safe it multiplies and if it is hostile it try to gain immortality to ensure it does not dies . opening borders is because it is money and the same nonsense on control as they are so many cases caught for people who are totally vaccinated that come here and we find they are infected and we place they in health care at singaporean expenses ."

"eh ? do you know the average age of death from covid is eighty ? until this month , covid wouldn ’ t have even made the top20 causes of death in singapore , now ask yourself why the sudden surge in cases and deaths , when all we ’ ve done is mass vaccinate ( peaked on national day ), and actually tightened restrictions . over sixty-five % of our covid deaths are from this month alone …"

"answer bebecause they are dumb and doesn ’ t under delta plus well and insist people to vacinated when they can ’ t and won ’ t . reasons for dumb jacks . one ) underlying illness fear cannot survive vaccine . two ) does not believe vaccine because many infected . three ) never ending boosters . so saying indirectly if not vacinated no job ? so have you thought about sixty to ninety-nine years cleaners etc no job ? you gonna give them $ three , zero a month . i hope they survive to next election . i expect some nice fireworks"

romi kwan first of all covax is not a vacine but an vacine alliance . next novavax wasn t made by australia . australia only buy novavax this year and originally supposed to ship to australia in mid two thousand and twenty-one . but delay thus now they are expecting novavax to arrive in australia in nov two thousand and twenty-one . upon arrival also need to be tested before australia will use on their people .
romi kwan i do not know if i can wait until its finally approved by singapore government to be included into the national vaccination programme where if there are side effects after the vaccination i will be protected . i have medical condition so i definitely need something that is in the national programme else i scare i cannot afford to pay for any further treatment if i have side effects .
"celestial star and good luck with that , as they will already be ninety % vaccinated by then lol . still , who wants to take it when no longer term testing down ? definitely not the six % that are already refusing to be experimented on ."
"this is not a case of “ pick the least poisonous poison to take just to satisfy the governments mandates ”, people will still refuse to be experimented on , there ’ s been zero long term testing done on any of them , and the risks far outweigh the so - called benefits . covid is still primarily an issue for anyone with multiple comorbidities , which is mostly the very elderly , hence why the average age of death is eighty . why should young , healthy people bother taking an experimental drug ?"
destroyer74 hello if you don t be restricted from entering mall to do malaysia grocery shopping or freaking just buy takeaway from a mall ? and if i catch covid you will pay for malaysia medical fee ?
destroyer74 if you don t anyhow assume . those unvaccinated got people with health conditions so cannot get yet . some just got cancer treatment or kidney transplant so only can get vaccination after their treatment as those requires them to take medication to suppress their own immune system . those normal healthy people can do not get they will not die but if i kena there is a super high chance i may die .

the next country of free entry to singapore probably will be india . our government always put them ahead of singaporean . they just can t wait to do just that !
you mention singapore has classified taiwan as . singapore only recognizes taiwan as a part of china .
please open with india also for fully vaccinated people with quarantine measures .

"use virtual reality to s safe , convenient and cheaper than actually travelling lol"
"vtl is not as simple as you think . on surface it looks good . there are still many underlying restrictions . like if you fail the pre - departure test , for example in germany , you can only leave for singapore twenty-one days ( if you pass the test ) after 1st diagnosis of covid ! when you are back to singapore , you can self isolate in your hdb flat room if your other occupants have the same travel history as you . otherwise , you can only self isolate in your hdb flat room with an en - suite toilet or if you don ’ t have , then must seek for alternative accommodation like approved hotels / facilities !"
which are insurance companies that offer travel insurance with coverage on covid related illnesses ( especially overseas hospitalization expenses )?

"people should just learn to comprehend what endemic means . once you have the vaccine , worse case you just sick at home . for most people , they may be like a normal sick person walking around a bit sick and still go work ."
endemic has certain conditions . one of them is herd immunìty and agreement among nation . don t think we have reach that criteria yet . have we achieve herd immunity ? do we see a decrease of daily infected ? some countries still on locked down and closing border !
why you do this to united states ... now we like india
hope to travel soon ...
travel burst close again then next year open then close open close no ending
more virus coming in to singapore person_facepalmingperson_facepalming. be prepared singaporean . be safe . soon singapore will be like india .
"so the ministers decided to sacrifice singaporean citizens life and health to allow travel between these countries without quarantine which honestly is just as risky despite their mentioned frequent covid test . do their homework virus is designed such a way that they spread most effectively when they have not developed symptoms which is also when they have not developed enough antibodies to be tested positive ! we must hold the leaders accountable if mishap happen and endanger our own love ones such as our own children , parents and grandparents ! suggest they don ’ t play with science because they cannot afford that as this will result in first in history singaporean blaming on them !"
government need money money_bagmoney_bagmoney_bag. so open borders !!! that s why they keep asking ppl to go for vaccines ! soon singapore cases will go up and up person_facepalmingperson_facepalmingperson_facepalming because of the government !!!
this is under vaccinated travel pass . only vaccinated travelers are allowed and they have to do pcr test before departure to singapore and on arrival . after three and seven days in singapore also need to do pcr tests at clinic .
to denmark don t need quarantine is true ? what about back from denmark to singapore ?

"from today onwards , anybody who plans to fly oversea for holiday , malaysia advice to you is you better think twice ! if i am not mistaken , ba has four pilots died after full shots and jet blue in united states has five pilots died due to blood clots after full vaccination long ago , up till today how many more i don t know , so before you on board the flight , make sure you check out whether the pilot had taken the full jabs , you better be prepared psychologically that the flight can drop down from the sky like a rock anytime if the pilot suddenly suffer from a stroke due to blood clots . this is a new normal , happy holiday !"
the fact that you created a burner acc just to support the irrelevant orange man invalidates you completely . no ones gona belief your crap about planes falling out of the sky malaysia dear . each plane has two pilot and is driven mostly on autopilot . go back to worshipping that orange head of yours

no jab no quarantine no mask no fly ... i free in home even can drink beer !
denmark with seventy % fully vacinated ? is this even true ? is it not less than fifty-eight % vaccinated in denmark ? is it not denmark already abolished all corona measures and will be official coming october 1st ? is it not denmark will go back to old normal with no mask no testing no discrimination to the vaxxed and unvax ? which news should we believe in ? mainstream news or alternative news ? as for me i already made malaysia choice and believe it s the right one ... victory_hand
"honestly , i would trust denmark , because if carlsberg did vaccines , it s probably the best in the world ."
"i ’ m shock that our government is thinking about america at all . highest infectious in the world , their constant disobedience toward mask wearing ."
the government has their reason so let united states not say anything about it yet .
we must remember that there are five thousand american companies here . they bring a lot of jobs here . the owners and their members have to travel for business and personal matters . there should be no suprise .

strange that singapore consider american the china being the lowest infectious rate now . truly political at play . disappointing if it happen that they allow american to come in freely
who believe at china s numbers ? at least not me .
what about spain ? one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and cases going down every day ...
"if see it as endemic , they should just reopen border to all . if not thats mean talk bird only"
when we know our government just wants money
"seal young i agree , this is an inevitable decision for spore . soon or later , they have to re - open their border ."
staying at home and blame government didn t supply for your foods and goods is very bitter way to live .
then you don t want money is it ?
"ok but be extra vigilant with high - risk travels from countries like united states , india and brazil . preferably rule these places out entirely for another year or two ."
thailand please . cannot to eat all the delicious and cheap thai foods and see all their beautiful women lol

"its time to reopen . changi must regain the crown from qatar . look at how the closure affects . planes need to start flying . airlines cannot continue to bleed especially the national carrier . covid is a normality . if you die , its just times up . otherwise you will survive ."
yes i agree . nothing much we can do . at this rate all must be prepared to get covid and hope can survive . so many are calling for another lockdown but its not sustainable .
qatar hosting a world cup they allegedly bribed their way to win rights to . perfect timing to win airport of the year right before the world cup . get malaysia point ?
i have been to qatar airport ... honestly it doesn t live up to no one .. i still prefer changi airport
waiting for boarder open to india praying every day . hope singapore gov doing good control measures and at end of the year will go . slow and study .
ivy sims town boss no for me also . when our we get vaccinated and at least on safety precautions release batch by batch .

i wants to go taiwan . pls hv a vaccinated lane to taiwan .
taiwan has trouble for finding vaccine source thank to mainland china ccp .
"our cases are going up again , one hundred and eighty today . what make you so sure other countries are assured n confident of our covid fight success ? they may think we r a danger instead , a small island seven hundred sq km , five . six million population , people to people proximity is densely closed . n covid cases in the hundred , never mind eighty % vaccinated . we may think we do well but other countries may think otherwise ."
when people from other country ask united states . we tell them we already standing on eighty % fully vac so just open up already and stop giving united states any excuse . muhahaha .
"booked tickets , hopefully cases are kept in check and reopening doesn t get postponed . beautiful british columbia !. remember to get travel insurance that covers covid ! ntuc income is a good choice ."
"joey tan so happy for you !! bc has a huge surge in cases in the interior , just like united states here . have a great time in 🇨Ascension_Island🇦"
was really hoping to see malaysia here but the amount of cases there are still not decreasing
malaysia in no1 worst country of covid19 cases . one . 6mil infected in a country of 33mil in total . that is even worse then united states / india ratio .
"jeroen derks yeah , hopefully it will get better soon and the borders will open again"
is the new .. if you give me thirty-five secs ... guy ?
plandemic is meant to promote the dangerous vexsin !!
then what you believe in ? got better solution ?
des chan the experts had said that the number will go up two hundred ... three hundred ... and even up to five hundred .... coming these days ... don s normal ... just lives your life as per normal ....
singapore future its normal till medical support limit exceeded
why taiwan is not in singapore extension vaccinated travel lane ?
there are many more still under shn and qo after pcr test even more infected to be added on .
wong kok kiong so observe safety measures and live life normally . get vaccinated is important
life goes on .. what is few hundred of cases where population is few million . even few thousand is nothing compare to millions . also it is not as if if they open up you will get infected . and infected does not mean sure death . everyday people die due to many other reason .. stop everything ? impossible .
rs lin exactly .. the virus wI shall / I will not go away . just get vaccinated so if by any chance one get infected . it s just normal I shall / I willness and likely to recover in one or two weeks . i work in the frontline and I have see so many positI have cases and likewise people who recover . one only get very I shall / I will if they are not vaccinate or body is already very weak to begin with .
rs lin just released ?
sgpork another released ?

king they do not know wat they r doing
"sure ! good idea ! how big is your bank account ???? do you have plentiful monetary funds to share with struggling singaporeans who will be in dire financial needs if our economy shuts down indefinitely ? if not , take time to grow a brain won ’ t you !"
bmpcos yah loh ! this kind of people never think of other people . he think lock down means close the door and sleep all they long only .
james tay and complaining and nagging are unhelpful
isn t it ok why still need so many tight measures ??
rolling_on_the_floor_laughingface_with_tears_of_joy lucifer certainly lives in you !
why ? because taiwan is like a sweet maiden whom ugly china trying to woo or maybe abduct and rape . you surely don t want handsome singapore boy to be involved in a love triangle do you ?face_with_tears_of_joy
germany got 4th wave . bubble your head
one wave have not settle another wave coming
bring back for infections more biz to close with so much restrictions
when open bangladesh
"germany had yesterday eight thousand, five hundred new cases ."
who ever you ... good job .. thanks
yes if you are vaccinate with their own medigen ( 高端 ）
"if majority of their population have been vaccinated , those cases dosen t really matter ."
"mexi yon sixty-one % at current . many infected are unvaxxed kids , but most of the come away with nothing much ."
peter kroll sixty-one %?? thats not really high / majority enough .... but if they ( germany ) want to open whose to stop them as for the kids even if only one of them fall seriously I shall / I will or died due to covid - nineteen how your going to explain to their parents ? just calling it a case of bad luck or misfortune ?
this rise coincides with the end of most european schools six - eight weeks of summer holidays . kids coming back for school and people going back to work from holidays .
"sun bird that s correct , and along with it more testing on return . anyways , the icu load is one thousand, four hundred from about thirty thousand beds . ninety-eight . three % of those needing serious support such as oxygen are unvax . that is what the singapore government aims at , too ."
travel bubble to queensland australia soon i hope . have close family there that we haven t seen since early two thousand and twenty .
my partner is waiting for me in perth . but wa will fight tooth and nail to keep borders closed -.-

cases as in infected people !! most infected recover !!
the endemic fallacy / theory will be a very costly mistake . at least it did not cover one aspect – when the atmosphere thickened with viral loads . possible open cremation like india ?
"the vaccinated peoples action party ministers should all infect themselves with covit - nineteen and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said , then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory ."

"allen chua by what you said , then , everyone can vote for change to protect their elderly who for valid reasons cannot be vaccinated . those who lost their loved ones can also join in . even those vaxed can also join in because forsaking is clearly unfit to be any leaders and cannot be accepted . malaysia wish is for them to learn from how to love their citizens and how to properly contain the virus for the life - safety of everyone ."
ttkoh123 these elderly can alway stay at home but most won t ... and do all singaporeans want to accompany these small percentage of people to stay at home for like forever ???
allen chua singaporeans at large are zero - tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated . singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher - risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives .

"allen chua lw also said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there will be leak from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “ risk ” because as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore ?"
"allen chua mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug . this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening ( six aug ). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time , so they knew . singaporeans at large are zero - tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated . singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher - risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives ."
"allen chua lw said on the twenty-six jul two thousand and twenty-one “ we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time , but at that stage as you heard just now , our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated ” [ note the capitalized words ] mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug . this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening ( six aug )."
allen chua vaccination should never be used as an excuse to risk singaporeans ’ lives . forsaking the life - safety of singaporeans will not be getting malaysia vote .

"allen chua how many singaporeans willing to serve army ?. but they served nevertheless . so let others teach the miw how to run the country and stop them from finding excuses . time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news ."

ttkoh123 anyway the point is .. even our kiasi ministers not kiasi about this ... show that they got utmost confidence on the vaccine .. you can only say sour grape because you cannot be vaccinated .
ttkoh123 like i said the previous time .. if you are not happy .. just migrate lo ... the fact is majority chosen peoples action party ..
"allen chua you are clearly a liar . because you speak irresponsibly and carelessly , hence you have no credibility . substantiate with evidence the statement implying that you have evidence that i cannot be vaccinated ."
allen chua all patriots are to stay to vote for changes for the benefits of everyone and not just to benefit the rich and powerful or be fooled by the enterprise machineries . singapore belongs to everyone .
"allen chua time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news ."
it ’ s based on economic importance . not health
allen chua you speak with no basis whatsoever and exactly like an imbecilic kid . show evidence to support your silly opinions that no one sensible will believe anyway .
allen chua released barking here too ?slightly_smiling_face
"allen chua like i said ; don party , they won the new sengkang grc in ge2020 , and this is a fact . and the party is apparently running the town council very well despite wild claims that they are not able to manage ."
allen chua where are you from ?
"ttkoh123 i agree about balancing up the parliament , but i find it distasteful that you are claiming that we are living miserably , as if there is any better way to tackle the pandemic . the issue at hand is all about maintaining the balance between the effects of the measures at hand . while we want to minimize the number of fts from high - risk countries , we also need to consider the impacts on the economy . you asked why the need to take in fts from high - risk countries , but do you have any suggestion on where to get the workers to tackle the daily mundane tasks aside from these high - risk countries ?"
"forcexjr so , you r suggesting to continue bring ft from high risk countries to ramp up infected cases ?"
forcexjr where r you from ?
forcexjr hong kong s indefinite international isolation . and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully . forsaking the life - safety of singaporeans will not be getting malaysia vote .
ttkoh123 you are exhibiting stupidity instead .. but what is more important ? current situation or investigating some allegations that is not even zero . one % serious compared to najid razak s and that man is still outside the bar .
"forcexjr just today one hundred and seventy-seven locally transmitted cases , ninety unlinked . poll results show nearly fifty % of high - income earners in singapore face money issues [ sjp asia survey ]"
ttkoh123 wow .. why you keep cut and paste comment ? fda approved pfizer already .. so very safe .. and jab and jab and jab ... if you are 16yo and above
allen chua so where r you from ?
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility ? as i said you are a liar . at the very least , you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser . don t expect me to reply to a liar ."
allen chuajust another freeloader that ditched yr country !!!
"ttkoh123 erm i did not ask for any of this statistics . i ’ m just curious that , since you suggested that we do not import our foreign workers ( etc . construction workers / cleaners ) from high - risk countries , where should we get them from ?"
tua pui kia germany has more cases than sweden doesn ' t make any sense this .
"lsl will the first to die if expose , he is so frail . even triple dose also not enough . covid wind is super strong , even with vaccination super storm barrier , the wind chill alone can kill him ."
"forcexjr in a time like these , stop all unnecessary construction except the absolute essential life - critical ones . priority on the life - safety of singaporeans and employ strategy as active waiting until a proven solution is found ."
linkongda lee family where got so easily die ... all at least reach ninety lo .. you die he also haven t die .
"ttkoh123 new zealand has seven hundred and twenty-one active covid cases as of today , despite tough border closures and lockdowns . what worked last year may not work so well this year with the highly transmissible delta variant . arden is being urged to reconsider her zero case strategy . they may have no choice if they cannot get back to zero cases ."
ttkoh123 already stop unnecessary construction for one . five years until construction companies bankrupt . ya la .. essential as well you think blanga on consignment .. can bring in just one or two to clear rubbish only .?
"anchored check your typo . compare this with one hundred and eighty new cases of covid one hundred and seventy-seven locally transmitted cases , ninety unlinked ."
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility ? as i said you are a liar . at the very least , you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser . don t expect me to reply to a liar ."
"anchored exactly .. even brunei cannot stop it either .... already proven cannot control .. so just get vaccinated . anyway this guy got health problem .. doctor don t want give him assurance he can take these vaccine . so he ownself do not dare take vaccine ... with upcoming restriction for unvaccinate people , he want to change government .. and want those small parties people to run singapore .... crazy ( because workers party also urge all to get vaccinated )"
rest of europe will be next .
ttkoh123 heard that new zealand also burst .. so whole world everyday change government la face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy like malaysia
"des chan looks like hdbs , btos and construction and returning to normal lives can only be safely resumed after two thousand and twenty-five and only when the parliament is balanced up . time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system , for example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news ."
"ttkoh123 resuming work in two thousand and twenty-five ? are you a prophet ? what makes you so sure that the pandemic would be over by then ? i t a need to in the first place . in malaysia opinion , that truly escalated the risk of the virus spreading , and is itself a bad decision when our country had recovered so well several months ago ."
des chan he must be from china . instant singaporean
"forcexjr i did not say the pandemic would be over by two thousand and twenty-five . i said the construction works would resumed after two thousand and twenty-five . please read carefully and not jump to a conclusion . and you did agree to balance up the parliament , which implies that you agreed we need all the real capable and talented people to lead united states out of these miseries . hence , the logical and sensible estimation will be in two thousand and twenty-five and only when the parliament is balanced up . substantiation : the virus was knowingly brought in . lawrence wong said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there will be leak from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore . time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system , for example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news ."
ttkoh123 no need two thousand and twenty-five .. next year two thousand and twenty-two can resume .. antivaxxers just be careful .. stay safe .. stay at home . let the vaccinated risk the storm outside . rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
great job singapore . please don ' t go back on these border opening measures . i hope public can understand that the number of cases doesn ' t matter when vaccination rate is more than eighty-three % already . icu occupancy is only twenty-three . five %. there is no need to panic based on the case numbers as most ( ninety-eight +%) cases have only mild or no symptoms .
"allen chua just where is your dignity or credibility ? as i said you are a liar . at the very least , you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser . don t expect me to reply to a liar . so you agreed that you are a liar since you are not able to provide evident to support your falsehoods as demanded ."
ttkoh123 a liar calling me a liar .. you lie the most here ... everyone know how pathetic you are .. maybe you should go dr chee t .. not vaccinated . rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
"ttkoh123 it ’ s clear that you do not have the answers to malaysia question . i asked you where to get our foreign workers , and what is your response ? you said i do not prioritise the safety of our countrymen . what kind of answer is that ? you also insisted that we halt construction works because of the pandemic , so shouldn ’ t the construction works return only after the pandemic is over , and in your assumption , two thousand and twenty-five ? this is why a total ban on foreign workers is not possible . if the global pandemic is not over by two thousand and twenty-five , what makes you think a balanced parliament could do any better than the current parliament set - up ? what should they do then ? continue banning the foreign workers ? until when ? until the next , next election ? this is why i keep emphasising on alternate options on securing foreign workers : if you want to ban workers from high - risk areas , you better have back - up options . also , be careful about playing the “ countrymen ” card , because i ’ m sure many of united states , especially ns men , would point our fingers at you for suggesting to cover up the works that the foreign workers left behind ."
"forcexjri don t need to answer your silly questions because they are unimportant and singaporeans themselves can easily distrust it . st readers / singaporeans are mostly educated . as long as they read and become aware then , i considered myself to have achieved regardless of how you think or how you want to maneuver their minds away from the truths . time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system , for example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news ."
ttkoh123 this also a call to all st readers / singaporeans . ask yourself these few questions : four ) is there any alternative to where we could source our foreign workers ? any country where its people are willing to do these jobs in our country ? any at all ?
"forcexjr don lawrence wong said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there would be leaks from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore ."
"forcexjr lw said on the twenty-six jul two thousand and twenty-one “ we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time , but at that stage as you heard just now , our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated ” [ note the capitalized words ] mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug . this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening ( six aug )."
"forcexjr apparently , if you look around , machineries have been mobilized to ."
forcexjr singaporeans at large are zero - tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated . singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher - risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives .
"forcexjr time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the grc system example , no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan lim , one year since pm lee ’ s promise to do so as read in the toc news . for the benefits of all singaporeans . lower gst , lower housing cost , lower cost of living , jobs abundance and securities , no endemic risking and flip - flops and real caring for the life - safety of all singaporeans etc ."
allen chua i m still taking all the measures needed to avoid contracting covid .
cw8 that t really know they had contracting covid or not as our symptoms are less and mild ..
ttkoh123 all snatch new water .. face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
very few incoming travellers will be prepared to undergo four expensive pcr tests and then a risk of being locked up if one of these is positive . if covid is now endemic and we are protected by vaccines there is no logic to inbound testing . germany for example does not require inbound testing for vaccinated travellers .
we are opening step by step . cannot rush and end up with too many cases and overwhelm our health resources . we have to work hand in hand with our govt
"it looks as if the st is too ashamed to report one hundred and sixty-one new cases of covid one hundred and fifty-six locally transmitted cases , seventy-nine unlinked ? what s up ?"
"ttkoh123 as of one september two thousand and twenty-one , 12pm , the ministry of health ( moh ) has preliminarily confirmed one hundred and seventy-seven new cases of locally transmitted covid - nineteen infection . five . we are still working through the details of the cases , and further updates will be shared via the moh press release that will be issued tonight ."

i am desperately waiting for visiting singapore .
fot what you dieing to visit singapapore
sam umobile usually i like to travel . malaysia last singapore trip was in two thousand and nineteen . at that time i was amazed to see the marina bay sands . moreover the people of singapore are so friendly . the most important reason is shopping . so as a tourist i am waiting when will singapore lift its restrictions for tourists . do you like travelling to singapore ??
绿水青山 dude lock yourself in your house ! don t come out !
yes preciselly travelling is singapores pastI ame we can travell to germany now I am looking at berlin I shall / I will hope the world is better for all thus you are wellcome
sam umobile thanks brother . i like singapore because in singapore everywhere i see discipline and i love the skyscraper in orchard road . so i hope you will able to travel berlin as soon as possible .
when burunei reopen their borders crying_face
wat abt india . ders no list or any info abt india
since i m fully vaccinated i need to travel to india too need visa been waiting for long . . kindly open malaysia too only for those vaccinated not vaccinated not thanks
"you needs to travel to india , what got to do with malaysia opening up or not ?"
when will reopen in singapore from indian s
social distancing mean taking transport to work in crowded trains and buses . the push to re - open offices is a death trap . allowing vistor is really not the time now .
"shukri ram ram lee burger no matter how you open , the gdp in two thousand and nineteen was one . x %. the opening don ' t help much"
hopefully soon travellers from india will be considered . please do it . malaysia family is separated for almost a year .
"better for you to go back to india and pay them s short visit , then come back . don t bring in more covid nineteen cases ."
come on turkey !
"pfizer has not finished the final phase three trials for the vaccination . it is only slated to end on twenty-seven jan two thousand and twenty-three . as such , the vaccine currently administered is an experimental one . any person who chooses to take this vaccination is involuntarily subjected as an experimental subject for a trial that i do not consent to partaking . bear this in mind , pap"
"so are singaporeans free of shn when they travel to those open - lane countries , and later back to singapore ?"
this is how the virus spreads .
expats are not equal foreigners are angry the one day close open lanes . it shows bad planning . they are leaving . the quality expats . so what foreigners are you bringing . low skill jobs . white blue colour beat singaporeans work jobs . so what you get in fact is no longer talented expats but low end quality then singapore become a third world status because by influx . the well being of singaporeans is not taken seriously !
new variants coming from asian country . myammar is one . general ming doesn ’ t tell you they are having huge outbreak . people creating diy vaccine and having lung damage . no doctors rate oxygen . so you should question 50millons spread does it give you delta / delta plus / delta singapore ?
qy seah so would you like for united states to stay closed off from the world forever ? idiot
"brunei is reporting about two hundred cases daily , and over three hundred today in a tiny nation of only about 433k people . also , it has extremely low vaccination rates ( singapore sending 100k of moderna to them ) and very poor epidemiological / epidemic controls . it doesn t trust their government with their infection numbers and has extremely low vacination rate . singapore covid19 task force is putting singapore to unnecessary risk ."
all should be tested regularly regardless of open lane .
what ?
"if you do not open the border to china , there will be no china virus . prcs are effective carriers of the virus ."
opening of the tourism in a selected country is a good idea for the economy of singapore
going to overseas now do holidays not a good idea .. world still in pandemic whether vaccinated or not vaccinated
hope the australian government learns from this . here sentenced to two years imprisonment .
all about money money n what else . it seems clowns like you just love to see more people getting covid . it must be good if people like you get the virus . then we can see what happens .
"awesome singapore , but what about unvacinate people but healthy"
are you serious ? there are twenty over ppl who are fully vaccinated and get infected with covid . now they are using ventilators to breathe in the hospital ...
what about student pass for indians
apply again when next year if covid under control .
"if they can trust those european , why can t understand the logic ."
"getting people to be vaccinated is all part of thier plan , mouth say worry for you but truth in fact is they need those vaccinated numbers in order to negotiate deals with other country to open border . so for those that got vacc and believe gov cares for you goodluck ."
"germany have nine bordering countries , european they are borders free . can we trust them they declear ? hope they can at at least put them in hotel three days even the test pass ."
"i believe reopening border is too early as we do not have sufficient data to guarantee a safe reopening of the border knowing very well what is happening all over our regions . it would be very unwise . lives are at stake . maybe test on reopening in singapore more fully before reopening border because of economy alone . i do understand the importance of singapore economy , but this is what the government must be prepare to shelter from . lives are at stake . remember the vaccines were developed in a rush and is only approved for emergency used by fda and the future effects are unknown ."
i like how unvaccinated people in the country itself is more dangerous than those coming in from outside the country . segregate unvacc people but allow people from outside borders to come in
that s muppet logic for four
we can expect at least one new variant incoming .
"in two months they will start shutting down again . guaranteed . just wait for it . the vaccines don ’ t stop the spread and masks only slow it a bit . new shots will be needed , so rinse and repeat ."
now one hundred and eleven cases liao
belgium is a very racist country
"please update the covid - nineteen travel restrictions or rules on the website of ministry of foreign affairs . make things easier for foreign travellers . don s job is to serve foreigners . hence , the description and language used may not be the same ."
"soon , singaporeans will be unwelcome ! in the animal kingdom , only the smartest and strongest can lead the pack for survival !"
sure ! bring them on ! there goes all our efforts !
the travelling l think go next year better grinning_face_with_big_eyesthumbs_up
germany is a nice country but very far and pricey . i korea to open up for travel . am sure many singaporeans are waiting for JapanSouth_Korea
i miss singapore too lah cannot wait to travel back smiling_face_with_tear
it ’ s not that nice country only in the cities where are people of colour . the west is a racist place . i would never leave singapore or any place to live in a racist country
belgium is the worst racist country
looking forward to traveling again but not too soon
"then do not travel , stay in your turtle shell"
grinning_face_with_sweatgrinning_face_with_sweat
so who did you vote for ?
"btw , when is the five per table in coffee shop and hawker center going to happen ?"
"just say it s about money la , so many bull crap excuses . living with covid is singapore being normal with no mask wearing and public gathering first , not opening borders to more variants ."
ya lor idk that dine in two pax max and unvacc cannot go gym / aircon fnb and many more other activities are still waiting to open up is the normal lmao . inside country lives not even fixed yet for residents now want open borders ... smh
"go back hong kong / macau still need quarantine fourteen days , who wants to come ? ownself declare ownself safe when their government press release already stated they are not going to talk about the travel bubble with singapore at all at the current stage ."
"formula for covid - one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four : new variant -- re not a sheeple ."
it take guts to open and go back to normal living thumbs_upthumbs_up. do not let fear rule united states ..clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands
"just come up with a good self test , even better then the one we already have . don ’ t force people to take vaccin or segregate the unvaxxed . especially when we have no idea how long the juice will last . very very scary this segregation and control when it ’ s not that serious if you not very old with underlying disease ."
hahaha only now singapore ? i thought you were soo damn rich not to open your borders ? why scared now ? yawning_faceface_with_tongue
"haha this is for the benefit of the government and it ’ s private company , we try to persuade our neighbors and friend to get vaccinated thinking that our government will treat this covid as a endemic , so that we have little or no restrictions but instead there is no change in restriction , they wanted to lift some travel restriction for their personal benefit , all the hawker center will continue to suffer poor business , what a joke , this is how we are fool by this bunch of heartless idiot ."
well done singapore . its logic to let pandemic become endemic
with delta variant .. it will take a really long while for businesses to recover . maybe will never recover .
than we close again .... again .
yeahh duhh to keep the economy floating so that singaporeans won ' t lose jobs ! simple economics ! didn ' t learn before ?
so who did you vote for ?
i was thinking should i come to singapore ? but now I am happy that i haven t decided yet
"better not , until both have zero cases ... stay safe !"
where are you from ?
so basically similar things will be happening to australia in december when the country will reach the eighty percent vaccination rate . it will probably also establish four classes of countries to travel to and from australia . by december singapore - australia two - way travel will be probably very likely with seven day quarantine at accommodation of people s choice . only vaccinated travellers can get into and out of australia .
"if you can remove boarder restrictions then let united states remove masks and local restrictions . eighty % fully vaccinated already , we have jumped all through your hoops , allow united states to live normally again ."
couldn t agree any better expressionless_face
"looking at you . s and you . k ,.. the people had the choice to take down their mask , then see what happened after that . be patient ."
"james tay far as i can see , they have been given a choice to not wear one , but still do when in large crowds . we have seventy-seven % fully vaccinated so that ’ s more than enough to at least not wear one whilst walking around outside ? i would wear one on public transport , but not outside ."
uncaged eighty-six it s one hundred and two degree in ohio . i will not wear a mask outside . face_with_steam_from_nose
government open travel in desperation of money citizen of singapore do nothing and gains nothing but are exposed to the potential of delta variant wide spread
now they change it to lane travel . no more bubbles wrapping made in china face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy let try this lane initiative .
ya lo thinking_face
china need to ban singapore as they allow europe come in
rubarani v really ? afghanistan want eat malaysia lunch .
we are helping to take care of three of pooh s family member here inn singapore zoo . you can have them back if you want .
i look forward to travel bubbles but .. can we just sort things out first at home ? it feels we are again rushing into something that will only reignite another lockdown later on .
i have the same feeling ...
good ! more lockdown stay home no need work
"good decision sir , spore economy can t only depends on sporean .. pls faster further ease of other country ."
yes . build more mortuaries and icus . let s welcome all visitors .
if we assume all foreigners here are vaccinated ( big assumption ).... and foreigners are 30pc of the population ... then does that mean that one . 2m locals ( or 30pc ) of locals are unvaccinated ?
james jr don ' t be so simple mind . the gdp of two thousand and nineteen was already1 . x % and many sme were not is good shape for the past few years so it doesn ' t matter opening or not opening .
what about malaysia ?
"malaysia twenty-three , zero new covid cases yesterday . what do you think ?"
hell no … it will never happen for now grinning_face_with_sweat sorry persevering_face
"omg g making mistakes again on border control . in order to control the spread in endemic mode we still need to try to keep our case numbers low esp from overseas imports . so the inital shn is still vital , all passengers on arrival need to under go the rapid test ( 15min results ). if negative shn for three days followed by another test before release to the public as passengers could pick up the virus on the plane or their airports etc . vax pax who test + ve are still contagious ... please don t get mistaken that vax gives total immunity it only provides mainly protection , shn from foreign country is still essential . giving no shn is a fundamental mistake , to the hard work singapore has put in . vac should be our safety net ... not a main net . border crossing via because way , may have come in without shn if they are regular vaxed workers daily commute but must be tested upon immediate entry . non work pass holders ie visitors need shn for three days + testing before release . remember going endemic mode does not mean we remove the care to keep case numbers low and we should continue testing of cases like now , but most / all of our business can open ."
this is about sia not country or people . the shareholders need to be kept happy .
positive move . we can t close borders forever
we have never truly closed the borders … they just cannot take the risk opening up to singapore .
"绿水青山 yeahh the gdp growth worsened in two thousand and nineteen itself , even before the pandemic ! by closing down , we are going to keep smes completely out of business . by your logic , we are going to completely crash the economy and not be able to recover from it any time soon ! forget about smes , even big techs and corporates would stop their investments here . our nation is running because of foreign investments . if we lose them , we are screwed . thankfully our government isn ' t that stupid"
no more bubble trouble travel . can ’ t open the community but can to europe n brunei .
"its time for another good idea , bad idea ... are we that desperate for tourism business ?"
it is to for sia survival … that ’ s the plan .
"not just sia , but also for changi airport , garden by the bay , sentosa , hotels , restaurants , etc ."
james tay we are responsible for china india malaysia indonesia n about one hundred and ninety-two nations employment yet the singapore core is the one paying for it winking_face
james tay many rice bowls for ft and spass and workpass and eps .
"actually , yes ."
you can take ten pcr test but who is perfectly fine from any part of world please allow them . why total ban ? if they are vaccinated months before . covid don t hide from covid but we can fight from it .
"good to open up the borders but calibrated , airlines need to work to help the economy all over the world ."
"with delta virus , no thanks"
its not fare if we cannot travel ?? totally not fare
life is not fair . suck it up .
"and how bout singaporean those has taken thier vaccination , can we go for travel ? and meet up , reunite with our wife and kid ???????"
"do not ask singapore , ask the destination country ."
go then ... don t come back .
"reopen inside singapore first , then open for others ."
"绿水青山 keep the pandemic dragging ? you seriously think the government has complete control over a pandemic ? face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy look at history , there ' s no such thing as overcoming a pandemic through restriction measures . you can have complete lockdowns for six months and still not be able to complete eradicate the virus ! that ' s the reason why living with the virus is a more logical approach compared to zero covid ! life has to go on . too many people have already lost their jobs . can ' t keep it going like this"
praying every day have to open the boarders for india .
no please
piratekingonepiece yes please
also for philippines ! i miss malaysia tinder matches from singapore loudly_crying_faceloudly_crying_face

why singapore ???

I have spent all malaysia money on staycay lol
true that !

batam reopen thinking_facethinking_facethinking_face
i t they vaccinate its citizens faster ?
"just open to batam first , seventy-three % already vaccinated 1st dose , twenty +% vaccinated 2nd dose , new cases below fifty a day weary_face come onnn !!"
adel must be at least eighty % fully vaccinated ( i . e . both doses ).
stan k yeah but singapore is opening up to other countries that are not eighty % fully vaccinated right now ..? like in this news
"​ adel for a country to be able to open to other countries , it must have seventy % - eighty % of its adults population fully vaccinated . singapore will say welcome to the people currently in australia next month but australia will still be closed bebecause next month , around this time , australia will probably have only about forty % of its adults population fully vaccinated . australia will be eighty % fully vaccinated by early december . so i think it will be opened by mid - december but it also depends on whether other countries already allow their citizens to travel to australia . for indonesia , a lot of countries categorise indonesia as a high risk country in terms of vaccination rates , vaccination reliability and accuracy , and the measures they do in indonesia to prevent infection ( such as restrictions , face masks , etc ). there are low risk , medium risk , high risk , and no - travel countries . i think indonesia , unfortunately , will be in the categories which is disappointing bebecause i want to travel to jakarta , etc , too . it is almost impossible to open only select areas in indonesia like bali and batam because usually when a country opens , it opens the whole parts of the country ."
if singapore eighty % vaccinated ... can very the can can open the border thinking_facethinking_facethinking_face
"​ azman selamat a country will be open to other countries of their choice if it is seventy %- eighty % adults vaccinated . but if the other countries still don t allow the people there to travel to that country which is open to them , then there is no points . east asian countries have much better prospects than se asian countries in terms of opening of their countries . so maybe japan , south korea , taiwan , sar hong kong will be opened by the end of the year . but for se asia , no . i wished i could travel to se asia by december but i think the only countries i can travel to in sea by december will probably be singapore and brunei ."
"azman selamat you need to refer back to category four , they stated the countries that they banned - pakistan , india , nepal , bangladesh , sri lanka , myammar - not malaysia or indonesia , but still need to wait and not rush .. for both indonesia and malaysia ."
azman selamat . have to wait unit we produce vaccine here . then can we decide who to sell those vaccine to ..
why not the united kingdom . we are close to eighty % fully vaccinated .
because number one didn ’ t united kingdom suddenly had a delta variant surge and number two were trying to not to end up in another lockdown
anon nymouz how is it when everything is open like normal . if you want to know what s *** is then look at new zealand austraila .
dannyisnow100 the whole globe almost has the delta strain now . over time new strains will come . the united kingdom death rate is low now conpared to the 1st wave . life is normal here now . they is no social distancing measures here . they united kingdom realise that lockdowns don t work .
"mike s travel show well yes but the united kingdom still has way too many cases . sure they are vaccinated , but they are carriers , and with the delta surge in the united kingdom , the chances of imported cases is much higher ."
mike s travel show if lockdowns don ’ t works and vaccines don ’ t work i guess this how life ends
anon nymouz . ceca worst than ....
"hoping to salvage their stock portfolio . ten yr libor is poised to explode , the global money cartel is sick of fed res lies for so long . that ’ s why stocks are crashing ."
"such irresponsible government . using people as stakes in gamble . economy goes up down all the time . death is endgame . singapore will be shunned world wide , irrational policies create dangerous situations ."
"if you think government is not good , by all means go and migrate smiling_face_with_horns you need not have to criticize until like that angry_face_with_horns"
it s not mandatory .
money money money always money in singaporean minds
"government cannot appease everyone . when the local vaccination rate is reasonably high , it is worthwhile to take the risk to reopen the border and do business . so many sectors are dying …"
品味历史品味人生 i hope a higher official in thailand think like you . we have to move on from covid19 .
"eighty , zero vaccinations daily means in the next fifteen days we can get another one , two hundred , zero vaccinated . and hence only the five hundred , zero below 12year old are not vaccinated ..... by then singapore will have ninety % fully vaccinated .!!"
绿水青山 wow .... talking about logic and commonsense ..... you need to buy yourself a brain ..... since you are so smart .. you have a solution to end this pendamic ? or you are just the typical brainless ibm that love to kpkb at everything ???
farjiel eight hundred and eighty-eight go finish your schooling first before trying to analyse data !
jumping the gun to open prematurely to expect positive result / outcome is wishful thought . it will not work
only way to find out with empirical data is to try . otherwise it ’ s just opinions and hearsay .
mikeis this a good calculated risk ?
rush to open up is unwise n stupid
let ’ s see the effects of blood clots at high altitude
is there a doctor on board ?
"風林火山 i don ' t have solution but you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it . in fact the border was already opened but you don ' t see much passengers in airport . the only different is they don ' t have to be quarantined . i can tell you that united states companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient . if too many high rank ang mo staffs get it in here and coughing , how can ensure the business continuity ."
face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy savage
remember to get vaccinated or a vaccinated person might get sick from the virus they got vaccinated against because you re not vaccinated . rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
living with covid means it should start in singapore . not a damn travel bubble . it shouldn t start with a travel bubble .
exactly
get prepared to get poke 5x for a round trip . i read that on sia website
it s cancelled in two thousand and twenty-one btw
james jr you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it . in fact the border was already opened but you don ' t see much passengers in airport . the only different is those ang mo don ' t have to be quarantined . i can tell you that united states companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient .
wasn t oktoberfest canceled back in may ?
vincecarlo damnnn wasn t aware haha
t x wonder how he does his job face_with_hand_over_mouthface_with_hand_over_mouth
"thank goodness germany had the sense to cancel it . why would a sensible , responsible sgrean want to attend the oktoberfest where there are literally thousands of people crowded together when corona is still rampant in germany ? i implore sgreans not to be too if they decide to vacation in germany , and bring the virus back to singapore . keep wearing your masks , avoid crowded places , especially indoors and behave responsibly in view of pandemic ."

interesting .... how wil ica know if any europe passport has been in germany 21days before depart to singapore ?...... mtf mil $ math !
"traveller man no stamp when crossing europe borders bro , and you call yourself"
there is no stamp of that because in the europe they go from country to country and don ’ t need stamp
"i agreed , even the tourist stay twenty-one + days in germany , it doesn ’ t guarantee that he / she is free from wu han virus or it ’ s variant . please rethink the policy carefully . if spread happen again , peoples action party may lost next election …"
"風林火山 i think you have to worry about sph and mediacorp . opening can ' t help their business . ntuc fair price you also have to worry , people can buy rice and other stuffs from other platform and cheaper service charge"
"td now i already very unhappy how peoples action party / mtf is handling the covid and believe many others too , if only more people are sober and already voted out peoples action party at the two thousand and twenty elections ... sigh"
td now very true
traveller man . no needs to chop stamp for europeans moving within europe .
the jury is still out about the full picture of covid - nineteen and the vaccines . experts differ in their analysis and are still debating it . look at all the flip flops coming out . think very very carefully . expose and listen to all views . let the individual decide . no forced vaccination .
when open for malaysia ?
绿水青山 you are a joker ... hong kong can don ' t open border because they have their grandfather to support them ... can we ? taiwan ??? you must be kidding right ? no scan no case ... they still got to beg for vaccine .. you don ' t know meh ?? you are really so simple minded .....
"stupid idea don t need quarantine !!! why singapore government is playing with singaporean life !!! all they think about is heavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_sign when is the next election . we should know who to vote now , not those government that is playing with our life !!! really very disappointed with our government . they only look after those foreigners and money money_bagmoney_bagmoney_bagmoney_bagmoney_bagheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_sign."
"that one infected person has still sat several hours breathing in the same air with passengers on the same plane on his way over here . the other passengers could be infected on the flight by him , then spread it in the community a few days afterwards !!"
this clown lie blatantly . covid will do justice soon
so the message is ?
"oh ,... good luck to all singaporean , with many visitors , we are going to see the surge in infection in this tiny island state ."
can we retreat to our shells ?
good decision for opening a border . now every country open a flight
what a waste of tax payers money making vaccinated travel lane scheme
fiost coz it mean that vax or no vax its still the same all can be infected
绿水青山 o by the way .. since you are so so so smart .... please share united states your great plan and solutions on how we can end this pandemic ????
what to do ? no more lockdown in singapore because we need to survive economically already . cannot do anything
"oyk and the miw coerced on t tell you about the long lasting effect , damage and the unknown long - term price singaporeans have to pay . these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
"most vaccinated countries the more cases ... israël , singapore , gibraltar ..."
let ’ s have more tourist activities but singaporean stay at home pls for goodness sake !
風林火山 you can ask hong kong and taiwan how they make it . ong ye kung thought he would be the vice pm and seek advice from taiwanese politician 朱立伦 via george yeo t know ?
"we have people flying into singapore every single day , even before this travel lane nonsense , the moh website shows that between one - eleven cases detected daily in the past twenty-eight days . so many of them detected upon arrival . never believe what the media tells you , look stuff up . they manipulate stats to suit the agenda ."
no worry singapore have more covid than malaysia and indonesia - why bother now just open all borders
gamer studio hahahahahahah is spreading singapore is so compact !
by forcing his eye lid wide open . we still think these opening of borders will meet with serious consequences .
"there is nothing we can do . singapore has held its economy for one and a half years , and we ve been suffered for that . soon or later , we have to re - open the border ( of course with careful management ). i have felt the impact of this border closure a hard way ."
a closed border policy is suicidal
"us is massonic state , first they killed all native indian than bring all baggers from europe and with this class they try to enslave entire world and put under register"
in un are all under masson law approved - covid not to be delivered to them - i mean if they happen to be under ventilator
crypto insider protect our family against the vagxseen .
if the freaking vaccination is so effective . why are we still on mask ??????? these people are all sick . all along talking nonsense !
绿水青山 their solutions is not solutions .......
exactly
nobody is saying vaccination one hundred % protects . so have masks is okay
"you can be defiant and walk about without a mask . your choice , who ’ s stopping you ? be the next karen ! only bodoh will dare to put himself at risk with the law or at risk with getting the virus ."
justfair use your mother feminine napkin on your mouth better one thousand % safe even with delta improve .
even nazi never prevented people to travel and meet their families - eighty-one % are double vaccinated - what gives you right to keep people families as hostages for two years not let in them cross the border in malaysia and you let people from europe to enter .
"風林火山 not solution ? in the first place , you let people from risk country walking freely is a solution . you don ' t freely screening the whole red hell to quarantine the carriers , that is a solution ? there are four fully vaccinated persons died and one of them is around fifty +, that is your solution ? there are several cases caught on a flight by other counties , that is your solution ?"
for all malaysian you can leave as and when you like just don t come back anymore . that include your country accept you guys .
"ong ernie allow me to enlighten you : two ) you have all malaysian guarding your police , scdf employed by cisco - and singaporean ’ s suck rocks"
趙子龍 interesting thing is australian government is calling non vaccinated protesters nazi - so what they have done all this decades to allow nazi to stay in australia
crypto insider you ve malaysia full support . let united states all rise up together and fight the evil .
"too many changi airport terminals , so they need to open all"
"of course , we must cover what we spent more tourists better"
绿水青山 hello ... i really can ' t blame you ... without a brain ... it will be tough for you to comprehend simple logic . is long - term lock down a solution ????
"justfair yes , more virus coming in better huh paw lum par"
the tourism and travel industries are already doomed . don t expect a v - shape curve recovery anytime soon even by plucking the infected figures from the air .
"too early , too fast , to too many countries that are totally reckless ."
can t survive on bananas lah
only one ? fishy there seem to be a plot to displace the locals and bring in as many foreigners as possible despite the pandemic .
racist singaporeans are in denial that foreigners aren t getting covid rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
yea bcs singaporean ’ s cannot work on salary less than two k but ex - pat can because your government that you voted give them free logging
"gamer studio who says 2k not enough ? if not enough , work harder . in united states , working two or three jobs is normal"
would you prefer the economy to collapse or find a way to live with the virus ? judging by this comment you must be oblivious to majority of the businesses and employees whom either lost their jobs or had a pay cut and is affected by the economy . seems like either your industry or wages hasn m lucky not to be but i see suffering all around me .
he is a regular whiner . he knows nothing about spore s economy . just nagging and whining
"justfair so money over lives ? wtf has our society come to ? why are you all defending the ones who are clearly in the wrong . we only live once , it do not matter whether the economy fails or not . as long as there is food water and shelter the rest are previleges . talk abt economy when you have at least a degree in economics or else keep that mouth of yours shut and stop being oblivious to the situation"
salty don t be a spoilt kid
"風林火山why you don t ask there are more than eighty-five % of people vaccinated and why there are more than three thousand, five hundred cases a day and why there are vaccinated people died everyday ? in lab environment , the efficacy is higher than ninety % but those volunteers were selected from healthy people but in practice , the efficacy is around sixty %. vaccination can only reduce the seriousness of the disease . even flu , there are people die in flu every year , especially in cool countries . flu can turn into pneumonia as the phlegm can stuck in the lung . this is basic medical sense and people from cool counties have much concern of it ."
"salty hello ! you just slept for the last one hundred yrs and emerge from the cave ? food from where ? drop from the sky or are you ok with eating grass and air ? what about water ? we are still buying water from malaysia or are you consuming raw rain water and toilet water without desalination ? what about maintenance cost for your shelter / home - electronic gadget out of order or perhaps you don ’ t use modern electronic gadget ? oops ! forgotten that you just emerged from a cave ! food , water , shelter all required $$$. surely , you don ’ t need a degree in economics to know these basic knowledge right ? so its a matter of you die from virus or you die and became a hungry ghost . chances from dying from virus may not happen if you have the vaccine and if you do not have much health issues but without food and water , you will not last long"
justfair you are comparing singapore to united states or united kingdom ? do united kingdom how small our country is compared to theirs ? is it okay for the country to go 1k case per day and it is still increasing previously from one - ten case a day ? are we not suppose to do smth abt it just becuz of . having a lockdown for 2weeks or so just to stop cases will not because business to bankrupt malaysia boy . the government still has plenty of reserves to spare if needed . nobody is spoilt here we are worried for our safety bebecause of how small and dense our country please . learn some geography
summer gal huh food water is everyday necessity . these kind of businesses will never go bankrupt wtf hahahahaha . not opening borders does not = to lesser crops / food / water . not opening borders does not = to unable to call some1 to come fix malaysia toilet . pretty sure all these are common sense
justfair btw pretty sure endemic does not mean opening up borders to foreigners just for them to bring in more straints of viruses . delta variant is brought in from other countries so that is not endemic .
"salty yes correct if you have the funds , but many will not have enough money to tide them over if we continue to lock ourself"
"salty the virus already all over everywhere all over the world . so how long are you going to lock yourself in ? forever ? close for two weeks , ok we ’ ll bring it down and then what ? how many two weeks are enough for the zero cases ? not sustainable and definitely not long term solution"
"salty the number of death and the number in icu are the numbers we should be worried about . if daily cases are high , but these two numbers are relatively low , then we can treat this as normal flu ."
summer gal another paw lum par . anymore vacancy ?
"justfair hey paw lum par , how is job doing ? remember , don s the most precious and important lum par in singapore"
"绿水青山 lol .. so what is your point ? don ' t do anything ? continue to lockdown and close border ? as long majority of the vaccined ppl don ' t die from covid , we should just press on an open up just like the rest . like what you have said ... we will sooner or later die of something ... please don ' t spread lie , according to medical research , you will stand a higher chance to survive if you are vaccinated .. get it karen .."
"summer gal not sustainable so we ignore and let the covid case snowball ... and wait till there is 1k deaths per day and our hospital overwhelms then we do smth about it ? its about preventing that from happening not waiting for it to happen bro . stop defending the idiots there is absolutely no justifiable reason we shld open our borders when our sitation here is chaotic af . only reason is about money and thats why i said money does not value more than human lives . we are not guinea pigs for experiment . they are toying with our lives just because of money . what has / what is the rush of opening the borders when only a small percentage of the people in the world are allowed to travel ? stop acting smart here its ridiculous , you will not get additional money for defending them . its because of people like you that we are not getting the change we deserve . people like you who defend whatever the people above are doing and does not criticise the most obvious things that they are doing wrong ."
justfair ironic of you talking about lack of education . reply to malaysia shit fool since you have an of education
"salty science shows that the countries who do lock down have poorer resilience . even in united kingdom , the cases are not translated to serious hospital cases proportionately"
"justfair btw , go paw your boss lum par la . subject doesn t make any cow sense at all ."
foghorn d cow sense or brain dense also no need to use vulgar language . we are a civilised society except that few but i certainly hope you are not in that latter category
"justfair whatever , no need to tell me about your civilization , education or manner . i have came across many highly educated people and friends . some even came from well recognize uni from states . and they are nothing but jerks . not even a gentleman to treat a lady . save your manner and bombarda english for yourself . to me , you are just selfish fark only think of yourself ."
風林火山 i don ' t say . it is you stupid people incompetent to identify covid - nineteen carriers and quarantine them and make the place safe . i already said border was already open . i spread lie ? you can check with hong kong and taiwan gov . how many passengers from singapore tested positive at prc ? do you read news paper how many fully vaccinated people die so far ?
"justfair hey paw lum par . two , zero over cases already . how ?"
"foghorn d too late to grow up , too late to regret . malaysia sympathy"
justfair first time paw lum par gets work out .. lol .. kena your point already . go paw your lum par la .. talk so much
"風林火山 the birth rate of singapore is one . 0x % and the increment of eligible voters of last ge was more than ten %. where are they came from ? you people keep on importing voters , even taxi drivers also know that ."
so mini . sir means the measure was not working on south asia country tat let delta entry to singapore cos so much pain to citizen . wat went wrong ? different class people or different class class country or different govt measure policy ?
"all food and supplies and almost every product you use comes from outside .. covid spreads through touch as well and on items ... covid will eventually enter either way .. you can only delay it not prevent , it .... singapore would die a horrible doom if you really close borders ... as singapore is the farthest thing from self sufficient ... actually other countries can easily close their borders and let singapore die if singapore remains to have this attitude .. as other bigger countries have their own food , water and power etc ..... delta is now everywhere ... and it did not come to singapore from a south asian country if you are educated and informed at all ... also its just a variant ... the first one came from united kingdom next maybe from singapore ... what is your point ... singapore is nothing without open borders ..."
"happy hap 2moro pls go to united states , the clever will take their family by plane , the stupid will put their family on the raft n enjoy the sea ride . every step is risk n luck , in air or sea . thousand of excuse n million of assumption . wat is rite / wrong . who is wise or fool ? the 45th ? everybody wans to rule the world ..... save yrself"
come on ... give mu a chance ..
coming sooner than you think
i heard by next month will arrive . no issue . we are vaccinated
testing negative on arrival doesn t mean he does not have the virus . he may test positive later while going around spore as the incubation period is fourteen days
"風林火山 do you know that how many people die in flu every winter in united states , rustic ?"
"agreed . but with 1k plus cases daily in singapore now , i ’ d wager the traveller got the short end of the stick ."
wills so how ? how to open up economy and keep covid in check ?
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]."
"as i have said multiples of times before ; safe guard the life - safety of all singaporeans , particularly the younger ones , elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority ."
vax are equally con ta gious particularly if the intention is to expand towards higher risks countries .
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
"anthrax virus yap , expert as in “ expert ” with open and close quotations"
"within the in - cubation period , that s where everything falls apart . mind manipulation maneuver singaporeans . these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
if you want to hide in your house and never come out then go ahead ! let others live their life understanding there is risk in everything we do .
ttkoh123 this dude is a bot
it will be the case where only vaccinated can fly
"绿水青山karen , what took you so long to reply ?? busy watching youtube to get"
"as i have said , and it s outright risky . endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure ."
hk opened ocean park for tourism what say you ?
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
fiost learn to distinguish between low risk to higher risk countries . hong kong only five cases average per day . singapore one thousand
"fiost hong kong has one billion chinese tourists , they don s travel bubble ..."
"fiost but singaporeans end up suffering . mom will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug . this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening ( six aug ). and lw said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time , so they knew . singaporeans at large are zero - tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated . singaporeans at large are against importing of fws or fts from higher - risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives ."
logicrules soon we may be considered higher risk human since forced to live with the virus .
"fiost keep comment on hong kong . singapore has over 1k cases and are on exponential growth , do you know how many case in hong kong now before commenting brainlessly ?"
ttkoh123 singapore always want to number one
"roaring kitty when both your parents up lorries because of the complication , then you will learn to be more responsible to the life - safety of everyone . in any case , your problem is entirely due to poor upbringing ."
ttkoh123 you don t seem to know why we cannot be a closed country .
"fiost lawrence wong said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there would be leaks from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “ risk ” because as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore ? why must they keep importing from higher risk countries ?"
"fiost you need to learn between lower risk and higher risk countries and the need to protect and safeguard citizens life - safety as priority . when people trade your means of livelihoods and risk your life - safety , will you rest your children future with them ? two thousand and twenty-five what s up ?"
ttkoh123 it is not a choice . we must not cut off our advantages in the hubs by disappearing . long term damages are at stake if we lock down . the world waits for no one .
"fiost please stop the bs and excuses to continue with the imports of cheap labors to benefits the rich and their cronies companies causing so many more damages and disruption and hurting the economy and risking on citizens life - safety . when people trade your means of livelihoods and risk your life - safety , will you rest your children future with them ? two thousand and twenty-five what s up ?"

绿水青山 karen .. i am so so sick of ppl like you .... every damn thing is about politic ... whole day can only open n close your big mouth to bad mouth singapore and the effort so many people had put in . do me a favour .. make your self useful ..... please ...
"singaporeans have never been consulted with , and it is solely the miw decision . these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
"i prefer tourism to be off the list till the global situation improve tremendously and with an ongoing covid - nineteen spike happening now , this is a terrible mistake .."
hk opened ocean park for tourism . why ? they know they cannot close
fiost they opened it to tourists already ?
kim gamer i heard that they are wooing vaccinated tourists from guangzhou and macau
let us close all borders ... who cares how everyone related to tourism and travel industry is suffering ... which is most of singapore .. but clearly you are not ... well all of singapore depends on open borders ... so probably most companies will shut their offices here once we let noone travel ... i hope you lose your job first ...
happy hap have you ever thought about how the people feel about the recent spike in cases ? do you think they want tourists to exacerbate the already deteriorating situation ? also i didn s safer to do so .
kim gamer newsflash ... its never going to be safe until herd immunity is reached ... singapore is ninety % vaccinated ... there is no more protection other than getting the virus and developing natural antibodies ... the virus will never go away ... and people who are expecting this are dillusional ... smart countries will open now and suffer consequences ... than suffer in lockdown for three years and then be in the same situation
if system is working new variant would not entered singapore and because another spike
hong kong opened ocean park for tourism anything to say ?
"lawrence wong said [ four may two thousand and twenty-one ] in defending the imports – “ we knew that there would be leaks from time to time . we know that these risk could happen ”. would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to “ risk ” because as early as april two thousand and twenty-one , singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid - nineteen variant was already spreading in singapore ? why must they keep importing from higher risk countries ?"
"fiost how many infected case in hong kong now , do you know ?"
fiost comparing hong kong with singapore one thousand cases and on exponential growth ? r you sound ?
fiost where s the link ? hong kong has a zero tolerance policy and did not agree to travel bubble with spore when we decided to go endemic
another incompetent
"one detected , how many undetected does he knows ?????"
fiost we will know when our case numbers get to 10k ... unlinked cases
logicrules hong kong opened already with ocean park wooing tourists and our neighbour with langkawi . no need to be throwing blames around .
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]. these episodes clearly showed citizen life - safety and well - being are secondary in the eyes of the miw ."
fiost how many case is hong kong now ?
"fiost r you really dense ? we had twelve icu on friday , eighteen on sat , twenty-one on sun .... twelve to eighteen is fifty % growth ... and our icu is only starting to reflect numbers and time lag from two weeks ago ... where our cases were around one hundred . so maybe two weeks later you will see one hundred and eighty in icu ... three weeks later you will see one thousand, eight hundred ... please think before you speak"
fiost even 10k is not a problem ????? you need to get yr head scan . do you understand the implications when singapore has 10k ?
fiost just released to comment nonsense !!!+
pls take out your masked if the system is working goondoos .
absolutely . looks so ugly when speaking to journalists in the public . the more appropriate way is to use transparent screen .
"the answer to end covid ! in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-three , david wilkerson said there will be this thing called the coronavirus and then church buildings will be taxed and shutdown . there are no true church buildings today anyhow because church buildings in biblical times housed poor and homeless people . plus , they all teach lies and then omit any passage that would require them to give . the bible says it s the poor , the homeless , the widows we are to reach and give to , not fake preachers that twist and lie about the word of god ."

they the gov knows which country to open or allowed them in beside the saying we all have to lived with covid just get all citizen full vaccinated
cannot singapore must lockdown again
opening up is inevitable . what ’ s our plan if these travellers coming in became seriously sick and overwhelm our medical facilities and complete with domestic demand ? what if foreigners cannot afford to pay ? any requirements that they must buy covid insurance ?

chiby evil government
how come indonesia with lower than seventy % vac rates able to enter but not malaysia that already passed seventy %.
vaccination rates : total insanity
if each aircraft have to make its nos to recover and make profit . what is the expected visitor a day from each of these vaccinated travel lane s countries . if these people are sick . who is to pay for the medical fee and should they be send back and will not be able to get treatment here - to further load / stress our hospital system .
i thought indonesia will not be able to complete innoculation until end of december
malaysians will flood in to take up security jobs . paying up to three . 5k sing dollars in ten years time . damn ! that s 10k ringgit . pay back in malaysia probably 2k ringgit or lower . thanks singapore ! lol
r they taxable think all jobs here

"for opening of gurantine free land vaccinated travel lane to malaysia , i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than fifty % of its capacity . all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings . for every private vehicles , it should only be allowed to carry not more than three paxs ( including driver will be four persons ). all paxs crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated . that way , safe distancing can be maintained . should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johor bahru and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches ."
should have done this a long time ago ... and focus on healthy lifestyle and healthy eating .. but make it our choice to still keep the masks on .... i need to hide malaysia pimples and not wear makeup .
"open up the trade routes ... but check the travellers coming from china !! china is focusing on war ... trying to establish itself as the world number one power ! it is highly suspected that china interfered in the united states two thousand and twenty election because they can t have the defiant courageous president trump opposing the un and china in his 2nd term !! and hence the weak biden in the whitehouse . open trades with israel too ... after all we are not a racist nation ! if we are open to islamic nations like indonesia ... then open to israel too !!! china is more focus on war . by the way , open to other news network like foxnews .. channel news asia and straitstimes are bias ..."
this is a very responsible and capable task force .
thumbs_upthumbs_upthumbs_up
"come people , let united states put our hands together to welcome all twenty-nine different variants of covid that we have currently into singapore as we open up more and more to these countries yeah ? and let s pray that through the opening of our borders those twenty-nine variants will mix and match to give birth to another twenty-nine new variants with even more deadliness , thus having fifty-eight new variants bred and cultured in none other than our little red dot ! hallelujah !"
roopa shree yes god is looking down on our covid task force and shaking his head at them if that s what you mean ...
"so what is your point .... lock down the country for the next five years ?. world has started to live with covid , whether you like it or not .... if you are too scared , just lock yourself inside your room and never come out"
"ramanathan for your information , more than half of the countries around the world are currently still on lockdown , especially more so during this period as winter approaches . so get your facts right before telling someone that the world has started to live with covid . only singapore is the goondu one continue to push to open their borders , other countries see united states must be thinking re just a bunch of clowns that do things without thinking ."
"sean lim which world are you living in ?. united states and european countries have opened their borders long time back . now india , thailand and few other asian countries have also opened their borders . keep in mind , all their vaccination rate is not even seventy %. nobody is saying singapore is so fierce so brave , it should have opened its border much earlier , once we hit the eighty % vaccination mark . you get your facts right ."
"just because you lockdown , you think that singapore will be safe forever ?. if there are new variants emerging somewhere else in the world , no matter how much lockdown you propose , the virus will somehow sneek in . so once for all , stop all this non - sense of locking down ."
"​ ramanathan first of all are you even singaporean ? you logic is like no matter how you lock your house , someone will somehow still break in . so must as well leave your window , gate and door wide open ."
"a tan i am a singaporean . do you go around asking these questions to everyone ? first of all , your logic here doesn t apply to virus . we have experienced it before , even after lockdown and border restrictions , the variants were still able to sneek in . now with more eighty-five % vaccination rate , we should understand that and open the borders . that is the point ."
stupid people do stupid policy and continue their folly . they continue to bring in covid - nineteen by letting people in and boast about their stupid act and feel happy doing it .

"why is thailand not vaccinated travel lane ? it is better controlled than malaysia , india and indonesia ."
why vaccinated travel lane with india and not thailand ? how did they decide
because thailand is virus and poor
風林火山 your chinese name reflect that your chinese is also very poor
in that case let open up for everyone to come in and out ! for goodness sake !
i prefer mmm winking_facewinking_facewinking_face
wise decision ! please keep wfh as default .
like and follow your frequenly news
have they seriously thought this through in making the decision to open to india and indonesia ? their covid cases is very high ... wouldnt it be sensible to open our doors to countries with low covid cases first ? no ?
love heart_with_arrow for money_bagmoney_bagmoney_bagmoney_bag is strong . let s go for twenty +

travel at your own risk
"every twenty-eight days about 90k over people are infected . in just ten months , at least more than one million people would have already been infected with the virus . maybe only can fool some sixty-one %, you say ?"
"the vaccinated peoples action party ministers should all infect themselves with covit - nineteen and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said , then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory ."
can you learn how to spell covid - nineteen lol
single party is unwise and dangerous .
you should see his household for their losses and then resign for the loss of innocent singaporean lives . talk more no use
implement rule but don t supply manpower to do the checks . no way coffeeshops will sacrifice their manpower to do thorough checks .
how can india n indo get vaccinated travel lane without quarantine ?? utter rubbish

"imo main reason is military overseas training in germany and brunei , do not think leisure travel was priority when opening these vaccinated travel lanes"
whether it s going to have little impact . forcing travelers to stay at one place for not less than twenty-one days and other restrictions obviously is not a kind of tourists friendly measures .
mad hatter wonderland it ’ s twenty-one days within germany which is big country

woit gundu you think we have so much money to travel to far away country hah like yours no sweating work but have so much money hah +÷=/€£¥₩)(^$#!
風林火山 are you the next nobelist ?
the criteria are quite puzzling . the four territories vary a fair bit in terms of new cases and vaccination rates . so what determines whether a country is on this list ?
oktoberfest is cancelled this year . very knowledgeable expert lol
omg that is so true ! rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
"next , he will suggest that we go to tomorrowland lol"
wait for it people . this mtf is asking for another more lengthy cb . by or before september they ll trigger a major spike - vaccine or not .
"pap will be remembered if all of these abandon rush to open up singapore for the sake of money , end up in deaths . i will be laughing out loud if one of their families is the ones among the dead ."
so negative mindset .. peoples action party so far had succed control the virus ..
風林火山 you are really well toad .
dee bu soh not at all . the peoples action party have constantly blank out these facts about the vaccines as well .
which makes one wonder how professional / reliable this travel agents spokesman is …
"as much as i am excited by the news , we shouldn s the risk of the colder climate affecting the severity of the virus and what if another lockdown is initiated . how do we get back into the country if singapore enters another lockdown period or if germany goes into lockdown ."
even during lockdown singaporeans could have always entered singapore with just shn
sq prices to germany are skyrocketing now btw ...
"if we have another circuit breaker after this , then who will take accountability ?"
風林火山 the education system mould you people lack of ability to think independently . singpore need another 10k years to have its own nobelist
they will said due to unvaccinated people .
"wong kok kiong how to blame unvax when most vax are the ones travelling ? anyway , they will find excuses to pass the buck ."
looking at the vaccinated travel lane vaccination travel lane . in reality it s worse than the current travel restrictions . nothing much will change come sept eight .
"german has 5k daily cases and less than forty % fully vaccinated , i don t understand the logic here opening up to germany ?"
"well , germany has a population of around eighty-four million compared to singapore s five million , and with a little math done and percentages calculated , the proportion of cases are roughly the same"
they have not included the rest twenty-five countries statistics .
"edgar winoc did you comprehend that you can t go without restriction to any other country than germany at this moment ? no twenty-five other countries , or you do it illegally ."
"peter kroll as per ecdc recommendations and most of the europe and schengen area are currently green , as well as some third - party countries : albania , australia , new zealand , ukraine , singapore , south korea , japan , north macedonia , serbia , hong kong , macau , taiwan , armenia , azerbaijan , bosnia and herzegovina , brunei darussalam , canada , kosovo , moldova , montenegro , qatar and saudi arabia . travelling from germany to other labelled green , one don t have to do it illegally ."
edgar winoc you can only travel to germany when using this travel arrangement .
"peter kroll currently , singaporeans can already travel to germany without serving a quarantine there - regardless of vaccination status ."
"edgar winoc the point is not going there , it s when you are coming back ."
"aaron we have more than six million . we are infested with malaysian , ceca + families , foreign workers including maid"
"edgar winoc the new rule is unitary for those who travel from singapore to germany . germany had allowed already unitary travels from singapore . originally you were asking about the other twenty-five countries , which you can not visit under this rule . how do you rate your cognitive skills ? or do you just want to stir the shxt ?"
edgar winoc exactly . most people were actually deluded by the media as though they can t travel or severely restricted to travel to germany or europe prior to ctf . which is absolutely untrue . vtf makes little difference to those who has business need to travel .
peter kroll i suspect you meant to say not unitary .
"edgar winoc anyway , who will benefit ? this vaccinated - travel rule seems more like a marketing stunt , than anything else ."
peter kroll we feel your angst . you are not alone . the least you can do is to communicate with your family back in germany as much as time allows . stay strong .

qi tein da sheng great sage swiss is one of the most expensive among all countries in the world grinning_face_with_sweat but yeah i meant many people would prefer nearby asian countries cuz of less distance and less expensive thats all thumbs_up
let s move on . hopefully more % of the population gets vaccinated ( since thats the norm now ) and just open it up and go . things gotta move .. the world and economy got to get going . fittest survive . covid is not the only thing that can harm human .. so .. let us move on .

india has perfected the art of covid - nineteen mutations spreading round the globe
風林火山 you can travel to hong kong or even prc if you like provided you don ' t mind to be quarantined for two weeks and going through swab test .
why forgein workers required fourteen day quarantine ?
"the vaccination rate in south korea is pretty high ( about fifty-six %) as compared to the countries of the foreign workers . again , i am not sure what you mean by in singapore comes from south asia ( like india and bangladesh ) and other parts of south east asia ( e . g . the philippines ). the vaccination rates in those countries are generally pretty low ( india is about eighteen %, bangladesh about eleven %, and philippines is about twenty-two %). also , south korea has consistently been one of the countries that managed to contain covid . this probably explains why the treatment for them is different as based on the risk level ."
a rapid resurgence in s . korea n extended social distancing curbs . next target for singapore 20k cases
thought last few mths need three weeks = $ 2k +
next india please bec india is safe now from virus
yr two thousand and thirty
"yes , we should follow whatever they do . shut our borders tight , reject all foreigners , stop all works that need them n focus in training and persuading all our people to learn to grow n eat grass n bulid our own flats instead . no more wfh n stretch our heads how to have more jobs , all work on rooftop to grow veg , yay !!!!"
previously singapore had zero cases as well so it is not impossible for taiwan cases to be increased in future as covid will be around .
"we now having art , swabs two time per week , increasing covid cases .... l think not save to travel taiwan , china n hong kong , don t believe them ... hiding facts ..."
why korea want open travel with singapore with high covid case ?
because we re higher
a rapid resurgence in s . korea n extended social distancing curbs . next target for singapore 20k cases
blyatneverseen higher in covid case congrats
es singapore had three . 4k cases hmmmmm
绿水青山 malaysia deepest condolences to the good doctor family . as for you karen ... go get your booster jab .

so what happens if i land only to find someone sitting behind on the flight became contagious in the forty-eight hours since testing ??? would i end up having to seven - fourteen days of quarantine in singapore instead of sight seeing ?? not so sure i want to take that chance . in any case at around 4k cases a day in singapore i might just hold back before visiting a danger zone .
vtl but discriminate own unvaccinated citizens ? shameful

sirius black i must hv touched the raw nerve to attract released .

"sirius black yup , without released to create fake support , they are nothing"
it s free to spread lies until you are caught .
bmpcos gd morning ! lies ? thousands and thousands of people going against this experiential vaccination is a lies ?
"... open more , while locals remain in heavy restrictions"
風林火山 i have nothing to do with no . thirty-eight . why people should laugh at me ?
"magnus thor ah , just like the ccp ? well done commie"
megalord ng search yourself . you are looking for things to criticise .
"magnus thor nah , i am not / are not no commie , only ccp commie like you do that"
as usual . running out of things to criticise . pathetic guy
bmpcos pathetic commies don t understand the non commie world
megalord ng you commies here and commies there . do not you have any logical and rational rebuttals ?
magnus thor non commie logic and rationale doesn t chairman xi teach you this ?
this is typical
megalord ng confirmed that you r only capable of commie here and commie there .
des chan do not put it in such ugly terms . we have always been a very pragmatic country .
"magnus thor lol , openly betraying chairman xi and ccp , no wonder chairman xi needs to ban youtube"
"magnus thor lol , since when are ccp minions considering singapore as the same country ? we allergic to commies leh"
travellers entering singapore also need to follow the measures and locals get to travel to the countries under vaccinated travel lane agreement with singapore as well .
"singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cov ! d response , and harsh restrictions and segregation . maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity ? cnn / united states cdc places singapore in highest travel risk for cov ! d ; fox bbc - looks at situation with migrant worker dorms . latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct 24th ."
oyo axum that is the risk we take for opening up . else we will always be in our tortoise shells . so be practical ! one day you got to go around looking for a wife . after some courtships with some girls you decide on one . then you got married . then she did not turned out to be that perfect after all . your aunties and uncles start to criticise you for making such a choice . did your initial decision to find a wife wrong ? or you forever remain single so nothing for your aunties and uncles to criticise .
haiya ... they dowan la ... singapore covid cases is uncontrollably high wheras the rest of the world is opening up again .... hahhaa
magnus thor how exactly ? hmm ..
bang tongkat so far have you heard of any country cancelling their vaccinated travel lane with united states ? thats why i say you mistaken .
"風林火山that is you , not me ."
"magnus thor i hope they do for their own safety . even so , could you be so kind as to provide me with countries that are actively opening vaccinated travel lane s ?"
"magnus thor you opened the vaccinated travel lane , but noone will come . I am sur eyou know what"
"bang tongkat we are just going through a phase , soon we will exit this pandemic like other countries ."
"michael z123x true , but at this moment countries should proceed with caution with singapore , they seem behind ."
"bang tongkat france , denmark , italy , the united kingdom , the netherlands , spain , the united states and canada are the latest additions to a growing list of countries for which singapore is implementing vtls . these countries had already unilaterally re - opened to vaccinated travellers from singapore . just google ."
michael z123x in the early days pretty sure sing was also the worst in asean for covid . dunno where you got that from but sure .
"magnus thor i cannot confirm that may be true from online sources , maybe your source is from local or state - tv that i cannot access , but even then , all i ask for is them to proceed with caution to singapore , and for them to not risk their lives . personally i think singapore should be responsible and close their borders so that they can bring covid under control ."

15th september two thousand and twenty-one
haha and a few mins on from this ... the drive thru testing have line ups of five hours +
these people are so much smarter than novax djokovic
the reason they do not mandate testing the vaccinated is because they would be positive and they don t want the world to know that the vaccines are a failure .
do not you have to isolate while waiting on results !
hi singapore kids on december 27th for age under twelve years old children should be get vaccine and then go back to school after new years s why on the boxing day start toward please take your vaccine soon .
"gar ni na do one art test face like the swab poke all the hole , those who need to do everyweek or every day be like rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
lol ... travelling with unvaccinated kids ... must be fun
"i actually live in sydney and omicron is exploding . of course , it is the obvious choice to stay home but our choice is to be careful and wear mask and don t go to high risk places"
very safe because they have immunity . unlike the vacinated . who has filled the hospital
you are awesome !!! thumbs_upmedium_skin_tonethumbs_upmedium_skin_tonethumbs_upmedium_skin_tone let s visit malaysia with vaccinated travel lane smiling_face_with_heart-eyes
waw malaysia negative comment got removed
"someday i hope under twelve years old children to take the vzccine like as pfizer , moderna , sinovac , sinopharm etc . like in china and the united states under twelve years old are doing the covid vaccine ."
"travel if necessary else at this stage , the sign of virus gone is still not guaranteed since it keep transforming . don t rush to travel unless you have time , money and patience to burn , else remain within your boundary . human visible fighting the invisible .. not easy face_with_tears_of_joy face_with_tears_of_joy"
"holiday travel warning : do not travel into any jurisdiction with a high prevalence of unconscious , covidiot politicians , news reporters , witch doctors , or border guards suffering from covid psychosis , masskholeitis , or vassxinolia mindfuckosis . your wellbeing is at risk ."
the real question is do you guys ready to get infected or getting other infected ?
sydney and nsw no longer need to isolate seventy-two hours after arrival
"true and today they had three , zero cases and you don t have to wear a mask ."
"its not how safe , its more like how lucky ."
"another great clip from steven chia , love watching good vibes in sydney ."
"unfortunately now in nsw , our covid case numbers are sky - rocketing again ."
most people don t want to learn from two thousand and three sars and delta ( and any pandemic in history ) just love to play dumb . the only weapon you have against pandemic is both quarantine and vaccine .
"weakening people , the media are the virus , lockdown the media !"
"over fifty , zero breakthrough cases ( sick w covid ) in arizona alone , but it ?"
"just a reminder , kids themselves can be covid carrier . if you want to ban unvaccinated adults , then ban unvaccinated kids as well . both are at risk of carrying covid ."
"better vaccinate , if they wish to travel , children are also carrier of virus as much as elders . or stay home safely very simple ."
expert knowledge not from medical but economic studies ....
"y s not abt who can spread the virus , it about how the unvaxxed will have more severe symptoms than the vaxxed and fill up hospital beds"
_eliza_goh we have been hearing this for two years now and still hasn t happened . perhaps invest in better healthcare instead of shutting down countries ?
風林火山 biden looks younger and energetic than your big boss . pls don t have brain and you need medicine .
just wear a mask easy fix
"who cares if the brat dies ?? how safe it is for the rest of united states if he doesn t get vaccinated , just give to him or keep him home . kids are a disease ."
i don travel that we used to have for the next three - five years .
more like forever . as long as people keep complying blindly to their lies
unvaccinated kids are allowed whereas unvaccinated adult are not allowed .. where ll see a balanced data .
morgan that why they are also going to be vaccinated lah . if not what we all do not travel and lockdown is it .
"for the covid - nineteen pfizer vaccine , researchers found that kids ages five to eleven had a similar immune and safety response at one - third the dose used for those ages twelve and up . in other words the children immune system is not fully developed yet so they give a lower dose but according to logic they should give a double dose . coronavirus vaccine has again proven to have nothing to do with any disease or virus ."
the question is how safe is being vaccinated ?
"meanwhile here , even we belong to one of top countries with super high vaccination rate , someone still constantly thinking of boaster and even 4th boaster ..... want endemic but humji to open ... only thing in his mind is only boaster and boaster , nothing else"
must be nice to have the money to travel and not worry abt extra expenses .
you only live once !
calling the price of the flights as is a bit disingenuous .
very dangerous to bring kids for holiday because they want to go to toilet than what happens to the kids have covid19 oversea than they have no hospital
"how about featuring families struggling during covid as well , only a minority can afford to travel during the pandemic !"
"only few people can afford to travel , at the best of times ."
"maria hewitt i do agree , however what wrong with channel news asia doing this ? this is also a lesson that people need to know that you don t travel just for the sake of vacation . there is a risk especially with a young child ."
germany ? opening up for for military purpose ?
isn t it for tourists ??
"hi malaysia love channel news asia , good morning from penanjakan hill bromo nationalpark sunrise viewpoint east java indonesia sunrise sparkler"
god s amazing grace i do not think there is any tourist from these two places
"damn . the 4g idiots really messed up . three hundred and forty-four cases out of 5m population is like ninety , zero cases in china . germans will be rewarded with a covid virus to bring home . singapore is worse than china covid situation ."

your app showing you are vexed is already in itself a vexsin
what was the point of rushing to eighty % vaccinated if they will take their time to open up the borders to vaccinated travelers ...
you meant the point for getting people vaccinated in singapore was for travelers to come in ?
hiring germany people one day before covid thanks
germany is having 4th wave due to delta n expect one . 4k approved to arrive . geniuses
singapore should open up to all fully vaccinated travellers . more than eighty % of singaporeans have been fully vaccinated . this virus is not going away anytime soon .

des chan i don m sure moh will be able to provide you the above numbers to show why singapore made such a decision to slowly ease and open up .
風林火山 pathetic ball carrier !
god . the singapore economy will surely collapse and many singaporeans will surely starve to death .
let s see vaccine long term side effects first . you seem to be dying to have more people come in .
john ji in line with singapore govt is stupid
"des chan singapore government has been transparent , upfront and inform their citizens every step along the way . they have done everything possible to protect singaporeans . what s there not to trust singapore ?"
绿水青山 your are just like a old recorder player ..... kbkp whole day long ....
tess dra this virus has been killing united states in so many ways right in front of our eyes . the vaccines have been administered worldwide for more than eighteen months now . data has shown that it s the long term side effects that we all have to deal with .

"besides malaysians that stay in johor bahru and come to work in singapore daily , there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johor bahru that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johor bahru daily . please allow land vaccinated travel lane gurantine free travel both ways for this group too , especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or upto four paxs if they are immediate family members . all vaccinated . also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johor bahru should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane gurantine free land travel soonest possible . this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they couldn t return to their johor bahru homes ."

hire me . i know tech and finance .
lift the lockdown it should be the governments job to protect and feed united states . i guess the only option is freeganism .
they paying malaysian the same with singaporean . what has / what is the problem ?
just give malaysian the privilege to take leaves and go home first as we are suffering from homesickness and mental torture .
as singaporean i apologise on behalf of malaysia country n channel news asia for above lack of empathy report for especially our lower income f to hold those who need to choose between affording for their family or their mental health . let us keep stricter law to explode the poor from poorer countires rather that costing all our govt officer families / extended families / in laws / friends businesses to have to pay more reasonable rates to attract locals
ask oppie seetoh of makansutra and he is champion oppie
"i supposed those long months earning n savings finally get to be with family , maybe even malaysian one people one nation , go against their govt who said , we will make life difficult for those not vas ."
why are we hiring malaysians ( and also filipinos ) for pme jobs ? these kind of jobs should go to locals first .
fiost not true . it is those blue collar jobs that locals shun . pmes are white collar jobs .
"malaysian workers , indian workers , chinese workers , lanka workers , united states workers , europe workers , burmese workers , thai workers , pakistani workers , bangala workers , pinoy workers , indonesian workers , viet workers .... they have one common denominator ...... these workers have to return home one day ... except one particular group that is been neglected ... the singaporean workers who have no where to go ..."
employ singaporean if all the f t because foreigners labour are cheap so the employees only employ foreigners but not singaporean !
绿水青山 i am beginning to take pity on you ....
singapore is heading for big trouble
"better lah gundu you make money we locals have suffered alot ... standard of living are so high our locals pay make united states suffered you make money ... foreigners too .. we locals get rises of transportation , rental , utility ... fine here fine there cut your salary is better gundu"
"family members vaccinated still cannot meet as we like . only two persons , two visits a day . now household members can dine together but not family members . but everyday thousands of foreigners coming in . govt opening up recreational facilities fr old and young . all these means more cases while the rest of united states , vaccinated must stay home as much as possible . does not make sense to me"
inevitable . choose between mental health and economy .
there is no place like home exspecialy those who love the price . pay what ever you have to be back home is more important money can earn back .
"the relationship between viral dose and covid - nineteen severity : tulane researchers chad roy , ph . d ., and dr . gregory bix --- this review found that the virus is primarily transmitted through the inhalation of particles containing virus and that the ability of those particles concentration of viral particles plus the length of time one is in necessarily experience more severe disease than an individual who is infected with a smaller amount ."
thank you singapore for looking after united states .
bring in cheap labours frm many contries for the benefit of goverment but local sporean suffer .
風林火山 none of singapore s fourth generation of leaders is decent
locals don t want the jobs ask seetoh of makansutra . he is the king oppie

bubbles all burst so what happened to the lanes ?
"well , returning home is important for a good mental health ."
"in the law of nature , the leader does not practiced yin and yang balance , they always want to pay themselves high and pay peanuts to the one below . that is the reason and result or outcome . secondly , the leader do not protect their people and pay them better and always look out for ft due to cheaper cost . nature of laws knows very well the heart of leadership . payback comes and now the leadership must open the eye of their heart .. do not always think i have high pay is god blessing but in reality or law of nature , you retribution comes unless you practice balance , just and fair , else 富不过三代 。 so simple ."

"boba fett dude , hav you been to europe countries ? cross border no need stamp passport"

"boba fett europe has twenty-seven countries , which has ai tracking ? germany is the gateway to singapore . when they cross border each other , no checking . germany 5g network is worst , seem like you hav more to learn .... nice try dude !"
jimbaran residence ai can even detect twenty-seven thousand countries seamlessly .
"boba fett in the world , there r only one hundred and ninety-five countries .... sori , las msg to you alien ."
jimbaran residence actually you are an alien in your own planet cos there are over hundred thousands countries on earth and many of it are underwater which only me can reach those kingdoms .
"so is the short answer ? if a breakthrough case occurs , the vaccinated travel lane will be closed for maybe fourteen days . if more cases are discovered , the vaccinated travel lane shall be closed indefinitely ?"
"i am not sure about germany . seems like their number of cases is pretty much in the four digits ballpark . well , then again what do i know ? i ’ m just a blue collar worker who happens to accidentally glanced through nytimes ."
"compared to other european countries ( italy , france , spain , netherlands , united kingdom ), germany is able to keep the outbreak relatively stable and see no drastic spikes to the twenty , zero + daily cases"
now singapore is ever ready to go to the next lap and singapore will succeed because the majority of singapore has been vaccinated .
basketball s to you
majority of singaporeans are eager for travel lanes with japan and korea and particularly malaysia . germany and australia are beautiful nations but i would say not as popular and affordable .
singapore will fail !!!

ßpęřm . would like to but resource at hospital doesn t allow at moment . need to wait till covid situation improved in singapore .
eric phua now you know why singapore could wait for most having vaccinated right ? cos countries are much larger than singapore . they cannot have waited for high vaccinated rate
"open to most european countries but not thailand , indonesia china . can ensure these countries control of covid are the best when open up ? hopefully , stop finger pointing at singapore citizens"
this country have very very very low child birth rate mean one child per woman only so it s very very very easy to keep here peaceful environment and to do development

what the f ^%! then unban the unvaccinated now ! what e hell is the point of this logic when we know that the spike in cases has nothing to do with e unvax and yet singapore is allowing eight different countries in ???!! how can you treat your own citizens this way and discriminate people who call this country their home ??!! this is not right !
绿水青山 don t mind because i will survive as compared to you karen
"i hate this decision tbh . they need at least a day or two quarantine , because , hey , you may be vaccine but it takes one slip and they can be carrier too . hate this decision ....."
mystery to the sudden spike in the number of covid - nineteen infections in singapore during the month of september the tightening measures to kick in from twenty-seven september to eight october two thousand and twenty-one is unveiled . five thousand and eighteen germans and two hundred and ten bruneians were allowed entry into singapore . who is the real culprit for thousands of cases on a daily basis ?
"well done , task force"

mtf thrust foreigner more then their own citizen ..thumbs_downthumbs_down
complain all you want . learn to live with the virus as singapore slowly opens up to get the economy moving . government can t continue to give money to business and workers to close their doors and not working . go get vaccinated or lose your rights to access many things in your daily life .
welcome at a really wrong time where winter is coming !!!!
vaccinated people are okay . they are . we should be more concerned for our unvaccinated . data is consistent
a brilliant idea to bring in the new lambda varriant when we cannot even handle delta varriant from ceca
but if ninety % vaccinated singaporeans survive from covid infection does that not mean ninety % sgreans will have long term natural immunity effective for all variants ??
please don t blame the people or the un - vaxxed for any future infection spike due to these foreign travellers into singapore . we have spoken .
nobody will blame you . there are a lot of families who couldn t see each other . there are students who need internships . there are business people who need to travel spore cannot be only about you
"come on . this is just the 2nd or 3rd trials for vtls ? and theres a limit to hoe many can enter . out of thousands less than ten were positive after enter . they suppose to test nrgative before entering . do not be so anti foreigner and overact . border cannot close forever . hotels , tourism , aviation , those singaporean working on these sectors has to survive"
"the nation that tried on so called zero case strategy , new zealand has close to eighty new cases today . they closed for how long ? you go and count . much much longer . see where they ars today . zero case strgery would hardly work"

why forgein workers required fourteen day quarantine ?
"the vaccination rate in south korea is pretty high ( about fifty-six %) as compared to the countries of the foreign workers . again , i am not sure what you mean by in singapore comes from south asia ( like india and bangladesh ) and other parts of south east asia ( e . g . the philippines ). the vaccination rates in those countries are generally pretty low ( india is about eighteen %, bangladesh about eleven %, and philippines is about twenty-two %). also , south korea has consistently been one of the countries that managed to contain covid . this probably explains why the treatment for them is different as based on the risk level ."

both governments should reconsider restoring the rgl travel arrangement via the land crossings . this is to allow singapore business owners to visit their facilities in johore and settle outstanding operational and administrative matters there .
well those going there to get yourself burial headstone by all means
how about singapore and johor bahru ? will open also ? or just between singapore and kuala lumpur only ?
sjeline lukiman it is not right to say that because germany with more cases as well and brunei are the first two countries that singapore has vaccinated travel lane arrangement with . both have opened up with singapore . so it depends on mutual agreement . if the other country disagree then vaccinated travel lane may not has happened .

where are those guys who praised hong kong zero covid policy against our very own govt for flip floppings ? we are very lucky to have such capable task force . thank you mtf

is there a system in place to verify the result of a art self testing ? seems to me a tourist can just report a negative test result using the app without even taking the test . i have just looked at an art test i took at home last night and there are no unique identifying features on the test strip .
it s supervised on site
jeremy ko thanks for pointing that out . they must have changed it recently . now all i have to do it wait until malaysia opens or just have a short singapore trip .
this useless mtf think our body is like a plate of rojak !! got natural immunity still take jab for what .
we open border when the cases of countries are high . hong kong record cases . sinkies record cases . i bet the economy is going to collapse in less than six mth time .
jeremy ko actually .... before they dropped the daily testing it was supervised on days two seven ( i think ) and unsupervised on the other days . it was the unsupervised testing i was curious about regarding verification .
the initial reason they gave on why covid was supposedly so was because it goes undetected . just like the tracetogether token .

"sweden ok lah . a big country such as sweden already have that kind of figure , dense singapore can have all infected and at least two hundred and fifty , zero deaths without control and you are actually ok about it knowing that one out of five people you know passed away ?"
viking this same group of trolls would complain if no restrictions in place and thousands of deaths if out of control
viking what good does it presents with spewing loads of numbers to convince people that how bad or how good is the situation of one country over another ? and singapore with even higher vaçcination rate yet squeamishly holding up is a reflection on their lack of trust to the experimental jab .

"look so cumbersome and time consuming . not practical at all . actually , custom only need to ensure three things . one ） must have vaccination certificate . two ） maintain safe distancing while inside the bus + crossing custom . three ） wear face masks throughout . all other requirements such as pre - travel on - line application , long term pass , prep test are all unnecessary ."
yes there is just too much unnecessary paperwork and predeparture testing involved . at least it s only a rat on arrival instead of losing one / two a day + waiting for pcr result .
"first vaccinated travel lane , first omicron transmission in one of the worst disciplined countries when it comes to covid . thanks singapore ."

it is wonderful and more win for malaysia that malaysia to open up soon for singaporeans to go in to enjoy the beauty of malaysia .
what is good in malaysia ??? food cooked with the cheap oil to offer best return for s $~ there is a saying : to know the tastiest stall in malaysia as there is always a hidden cost .
"keep the border close infinitely ; keep singapore monies within singapore to help our own smes n fnb first . also avert any covid19 brought back uprising . when did johor / malaysia help singapore ??? always give united states problems of water supply , aeroplane flyover borders , rail hsr contract cancellation - worst is the marine intrusion into tuas singapore territorial water , wanting singapore to make war . bad poor neighbour ."
true that
close the border
i think city square now become kampung sqaure
shopping also anywhere nices places miss fam victory_hand important visiting
johor is not singapore problem . its malaysian leaders incompetence that they didn t do anything for their state and johor business just rely on singaporeans
sounds like malaysia needing singapore always
singapore not to open the border malaysia case are very high
in reality this is the least priority for both governments . a state cannot just make businesses cater to only one country . why locals do not go to these businesses to spend . ask yourselves . it was designed in the beginning for tourist only . spending power . get it .
"going back to the old ways . ask the variant for permission first . tourism , the variant do not like unless there is a cure"
there was this circulating message warning singapore not to visit johor bahru as their robbers are waiting
good lah hope singaporean known don pore .. and also increase all good in malaysia ..
"if i am not mistaken , its malaysia that closes the causeway within twenty-four hrs just after singapore announces that they will not close them because it affects many people ."
eighty % singaporean give business to malaysia wow unbelievable than what happen to malaysian people
just johor bahru .. not whole malaysia
sweetkiller xx johor also consider big as singapore don t travel to johor bahru shopping
residentgood bruh johor three times the size of singapore .. anyway can sia a good place to bargain for food and leisure ..
those eateries half full because of we re still in this pandemic la omg . if vaccinated travel lane fully open do you really want these places to become fully packed and crowded ? vaccinated travel lane open = no more covid for you ?
"all countries should seek damage and compensation from source of origin of wuhan viruses . no benefits on dealing cw mainland chinese , only miisery and menace from the communists n its revile officials ."
very true ...
jb robbers waiting for rich singaporeans to rob
"rob what , now all going cashless"
a bit bias .... skudai area ... kulai jaya ... especially premium outlets ... they are back to normal .
we scare johor bahru robbers are rubbing their hands waiting to rob ...
exactly
crime rate is very high in jb
"this is nothing new , the same is also happening at the malaysia - thailand border towns such as haadyai , sadao , satun etc which relied heavily on malaysian tourists ."
"no offence .... in away i agreed s . if land vaccinated travel lane more relax or go back to pre covid , it will benefit both . but the biggest concern for me , is safety . i personally , witness a day light robbery , a few years back , when i was in johor bahru . it happened just across the street . although i look forward to the borders opening , i will still hold back awhile , before i visit johor bahru ."
but they are covering the johor - singapore border . majority of singaporean t give af about what happened at the malaysia - thailand borders . maybe you should start a news coverage about the malaysia - thailand borders
singaporean are not welcome by many johorean .
"yeah , not welcome but people , businesses and even politicians begging singaporeans to go back ."
they like singapore money not singaporean ..... money-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_facemoney-mouth_face
singaporean like malaysian currency too
it cuts both ways . singaporeans loves to shop and dine in johor bahru not out of love . rather baecause of attractive exchange rates
singaporean or malaysian both like $$$face_with_tears_of_joy
tourism is far from happening ; maybe two thousand and twenty-five
there won t be any economy left if they remain closed forever so do not think so
"the johor bahru business owners relying on singaporean for sustainability are not aware that they ve crossed the bridge of no return . the world that they knew it , is already over . their businesses are standing right at the doorway of the graveyard waiting to be buried ."
exactly
"this cyclical border shutdown , lockdown and booster shots was planned by the cabals to goes on for many years to come . it will only end through war , regime change , worldwide terrorist attack and civil unrest . and , the masses can create this climate just by using their thoughts energy for the transformation to take effect ."
"in all honesty , i more familiar with the roads in johor bahru than the roads in jurong . now that this vaccinated travel lane is back , people may simply start renting and prepping for when singaporean can cross back to normal ."
aim for that to happen in two thousand and ninety-five .
for singapore cars to drive to malaysia .. i dun think it will happen before cny ..
"mrboliao98 yes , look on the bright side .. at least still alive ... still employed .. and the internet still let us you connect to the world virtually , you can still s little happiness .."

the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face - to - face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october .
"so , let total infected children is eleven , eight hundred and forty numbers"
"while they practice safety by avoidance , singaporeans have to face the risks ?"
"as i have said multiples of times before ; safe guard the life - safety of all singaporeans , particularly the younger ones , elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority ."
"so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans [ for you , with you ] if you will have to accept daily c19 deaths and thousands community infection ? for it is not a solution . the question is when will it reach you or our family members .?"
he has proven to be a man of mettle . the whole of singapore should rally behind lky in his noble quest for his glory and the glory of singapore
peter chew he had beaten china no1 and japan no1 . and malaysia no1 . he is young and handsome . should be singapore idol .
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine . it s simply illogical in the context of citizens life - safeties . single party is unwise and dangerous .
politics one hundred and one : but not doing so is merely an excuse to avoid future blame . single party is unwise and dangerous .
"discrimination policy does not work , when we can see that all fifteen deaths are fully vaccinated seniors ."
hello ..... how about philippines Philippines can we travel to singapore Singapore now ? we are fully vaccinated ... malaysia husband and me .... just asking ..... thank you very much
"so selfish of those traveller coming in to singapore and out bringing virus to united states and your own country !!! never used brain to think !! should not travel during this time !!! you feel happy when you travel if get infected do you think worth it !!! very selfish of the government because of money , taking your countrymen life in risk !!!"
the vaccinated travel lane portal does not work . it does not read nor accept proof of vaccination from usl . i am unable to get vaccinated travel lane approval from united states . load of bullshit nonsense
it s been two years . we need to start travelling again .
currently there is no report of ay . four . two . variant in singapore .... yet but united kingdom has the ay . four . two is amongst the countries which are on the singapore
home recovery is now the norm . if you get infected you will be sent home
"please return malaysia money when i paid for quarantine last time ,,, why make me quarantine n now no need ,, pay me back malaysia hard earn money"
i hope that travellers continue to take extra precautions when they travel overseas under the vaccinated travel lanes . folded_hands

who pay for the covid test kits for school children ? not every family is as rich as those highly paid individuals .
sg is now classified as a high risk country by who . why ? too eager with open arms in welcoming foreign spreaders ?
"most welcome your money_bag to boost economy . enjoy at own risk , keep safe with mask on . singapore is a “ fine ” city !"
avtls are also expanded to include the you s . its citizens are warned against travel to the city state due to very high level of covid - nineteen .

open up for vaccinated travel lane - but shut down dining in for singaporean - does it make a difference ?
it does . because we will soon have new overseas covid variants .
the govt urge united states to stay at home but they let foreigners come into singapore . did they also advise them to stay in hotel and not go out ? lol
"stupid tourists . come singapore do what . there is nothing to do ! because our government have no balls ! our government only know how to penalized their own citizens only . catch food delivery people for illegal parking when they are not obstructing traffic , catch all the petty stuff and doing just half past six efforts to safe their face and economy . bring back sirs ! the entire peoples action party cabinet all waive half a year salary can help citizen how much already ! resign la ong ye kung , lawrence wong !"

good luck to singaporen people that travel overseas at your own risk what happens if your whole family has covid19 what do you do spend your holiday qurtuinte in the hotel room totally waste your money away
well like that you do not travel forever since so scare .
lisa lim its not about the fear more about the inconvenience . and in inflationary environment and public health division .. the trends towards intl travel will likely change towards local focused journey ..

spade_suit lovely free soul spade_suit waste money is not you to comment as you are not travelling .
bmpcos wow like that also need debate waste of resouces and time . look if the person need to travel then go ahead . the risk is there but need to take precaution .
spade_suit lovely free soul spade_suit i mean is you are the traveller and the mei wu is also not so why say other people waste money . then why quick to judge those who travel now waste money
those infected with covid will see long term deterioration of health .
so go to your shell . don t show too much fear here
"four thousand daily cases in 5m population is like one , zero , zero daily cases in china one . 3b population by proportion . singapore is dangerous place to be . the foreigners will get covid very soon . some of them will bring in more deadly variants . travel is stupid wasteful activity . bad things will happen to all because of greed ."

"singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met . malaysia fellow singaporeans , join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the peoples action party . to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one , use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this because . the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute , it is time for a revolution . revolution of our times ."

"one the construction and building maintence fee in hong kong is extreme high , 100x higher than shenzhen . a concrete road safety barrier , size about two metre x fifty cm x 30cm tender bill cost hkd about three hundred , zero . very crazy price .

"fyi , omnicron is stands for optimus prime"
"omicron already in ready i heard cases peoples come in ready it come from forienngers import cases then slowly it will come local hmm delta also started like this . give me break do a simple lockdown before omicron cases rise . i wanna in singapore midst of bankrupt people keep saying economy economy i ask we have tons of reserve i guess n termsek holding still have tons of money with a lot of investment . just let in business as , usual i mean forigeng pass doing business import goods n trade in all ok but stop those workpass first coming in temporary totally stop ! best stop foreigners coming in un less for exceptional . we have already had alot of foreigners to do all those cleaner job n construction . we need plan n stablise also do lockdown so that minimize . lives is more important . the gov ask to limited size of dinning ask is it effective nope look at mrt n buses n look at people still kerna"
"so if the number of cases surge again due to in - ef11tive national vaccine , do you require all sporeans to get fourth booster shot ? compare with indonesia and cambodia and china , they all use much better vac"
its a big joke . widen vaccinated travel lane to include sporeans to enter malaysia . but bas tickets are all sold out till next feburary . in two thousand and twenty-two !!!!
"the omicron variant was first detected from south africa by south african scientists , why aren t we doing anything about it ?"
dislikes here backhand_index_pointing_downmedium-light_skin_tone
the imperfect perfectionist can you compensate the suffering and death of singaporeans .
"who ’ s latest update for december seven showed that all two hundred and twelve omicron cases documented across eighteen european union countries were either mild or without any symptoms at all . so why should we once again turn our lives upside down , even if millions become exposed , if the symptoms are going to be like those of the common cold ?"
who is paying for this widen healthcare ???? i rather you not have the vaccinated travel lane .
"its nice to here that can now travel . but need to spend more for the required test in both country , so no point of traveling ,,"
expecting the omicron to follow ur script again ??
what if i am malaysian in singapore ? am i eligible to receive booster at any centre here in singapore ?
u can have malaysia booster .
"don t use booster that is not eff1tive . use inactivated virus which is better and safer . look at indonesia and cambodia low figures ,"
i believed omicron virus earlier already in singapore but not detected . those clown clown_face sitting still don s thing happen then do . wasted our money .
"gurmit singh no , i am not responsible to compensate for random people s lives . a modicum of reality should tell that to anyone ."
vtl is very tired lives

why vaccinate young children ? makes no sense .
"it ’ s a good thing that the population of singapore is not armed , or i would be nervous if i were the guy in the pink shirt ."
why would i travel to singapore if i have to perform a daily test for seven days in a row . oh yeah and omicron spells the end of the pandemic and beginning of the endemic . time to let everyone get back to normal .
ya ya no point coming here with test and spent more money rolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughingrolling_on_the_floor_laughing
"lol . if it really ends , then why do so many countries want mandatory booster shots ?"
"actually already ended , just they can t stop making it serious , lots of money can be made"

"aiya go out from singapore pay here and there , so many covid name koyak bro , who idea is this ? did anyone knows this earth since start to end virus already born , why so worried bro . the end we all sure rip"
always making preparations way ahead - this is what the responsible and capable s pore govt . is all about . bravo !
sorry you still won t get your pr status
"dear ministers , your decisions and policies have failed and caused so much grief to singaporeans . never listened to me ."
not much of a difference if vaccinated travel lane is still expensive
"gov itchy , get ready to have cases to go is below five hundred because everybody stay at home mah , once people start going back to office you will see it shoot back to two thousand . some sick also still go back say gov never check , gov zzz on the job mah won ` t be so suay kena spot check . all office workers close one eye , than have a party bring out the beers"
you can live with whatever you . but don s the general public consensus for the three of you . you have failed . why should the people listen to your same old story .
no news yet . still got to be very2 alert and careful .
"what about booster jab effect on obese , fat , and lazy people with sedentary lifestyle ?"
vaccines are not vitamins but actually p01s0n . take inactivate virus which is safer .
what a magnificent states man . i rank him on par if not higher than our late lky

"when will the singapore nightlife be allowed to resume . all we have done for the past two years is work ourselves to death with no real avenues to blow off steam . bars , clubs , should slowly be allowed to open up and operate beyond the ten + pm curfew ."
"well you can go to johor bahru for your bars , club etc to let off your steam and semen now that the land vaccinated travel lane is liberated ."
go geylang lor . can blow other things
boba fett then what get co vid again haha ktv
how do you know proof of vaccination is not fabricated if vaccinated could still contract ?
even those who had boosters got omicron
oh so not for citizens but foreigners ...
during this omicron cases in singapore peoples action party still want to extended and let more malaysia coming in !!! i s the one that make the storm happen !!! when will all this clown step down !!
hello . malaysia and spore used to be same country lah . it is only racial conflict that split the country . spore opening up to other countries like germany is bringing the virus in
how about singapore batam sir ? when opening borders ?
"the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with vco / lauric acid , and total community viral load can be lowered , do not play dice with covid , try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time ."
we work from home rather to save our money spent for using transport and spending for f b
what about outgoing travellers ?
"sorry , not interested . i dun mean team b"
still talking . singapore is heading for big trouble .
they already tell you other countries have omicron
ready for next virus pi to come after omicron .
art kit should be able to test omicron . since it is coming .
"infection rate aside , how deadly is this omicron ?"
our present government can do whatever they like . even when they are voted out they still can take up jobs in the government policy making job . the choice of the citizen is not taken into consideration at all . democratic of one man one vote to get the appropriate person to represent united states is taken lightly .
only a matter of time you will find out
how deadly is covid nineteen ? not everyone is dying
as deadly as the pandemic of disappearing cpf funds .
bebecause we don t know yet whether this viruses can because severeness illness to people who have certain diseases like comorbid or unvaccinated peoples and elderly too
coco mubako omg one of the rare sensible response here . yes we still don ’ t know much about omicron
"uk declares first death due to omicron , as hospitalizations increase and pm boris warns of a tidal wave of infections in united kingdom ."
"whatever , anyway viruses have everywhere since we are born to this world just because of politics and business make it life more difficult just take care of our families good and safe our lives by our own way should be ok"
"wrong the person died with omicron not of omicron ,, you need to see past the word games they play ... the person was a elderly cancer patient ..."
won t it be safer to allow travelling via private cars instead of buses and trains .
cannot upsell tix of you go in via own car mahh ...
using buses to ferry people in . is to allow bas companies to make tons of money . and to control the number of people to enter .
"i want go johor bahru pump cheap petrol , makan , and enjoy massage ..."
"decepticons , we have allie with autobots to fight against the omicron ...."
"no point to close the country . if close , how long can singapore afford to close ."
all collected year end bonuses . reading from paper .
this govt simply wants everyone of united states to get covid . its disrupting our work and health for goodness
you want them to read from palms ?
pap ministers also got kickbacks from pharma to promote vaccines .
"james lim aiyo be careful what you said , after get kick into the police station ."
is not a lot of industries not doing well ? all affected by covid ? only government bodies making money ? so all of them have bonuses ? they must be more efficient and productive ?
fiost i got heart clamp after 2jab . nothing the doctor can do for a week until i ask for steroid ! safe huh ?
old lee all the best .
can we torlerate these rubbish anymore .
fiost i need to go 3rd jab . how ?
james lim did you inform the police or cpib ? don t talk yourself into trouble .
beware ceca rats
"james lim if not racist , is there any scientific reason or logic to ur comment . number of reported cases in india is lower than most other countries . and in a way , india could have achieved herd immunity during their delta wave itself . then , why single out india bro .."
come on . ceca rats ? really ?
what has this to do with ceca ?
"insurance , ferry ticket , art test nearly cost to $ 600sgd . lol"
we re all tired of lockdown
"no one want to go singapore anyway if still need to do pcr test , insurance , this and that when arrive in singapore . i wait till normal no test and test ."
here work place not for holidaymakers
only visitors from batam to singapore but what about leaving singapore to go batam ? still inside the vaccinated travel lane area which is bintan and nongsa only ....
why always gave privileged to foreigners when they visit here during this period n no need for stay home notice .. for united states we have to confain in a resorts .. movement are restricted n back to singapore quarrentine somemore ... what vaccinated travel lane is this ?
at last is not bubble anylonger .. thanks so we could see family there
now you go there . but there not allow you go shopping ... just like prison in resort only . what a waste of money .face_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joyface_with_tears_of_joy
thumbs_upthumbs_up
better don ’ t go come back deep trouble here everyday the infection is very high you are ask to stay home if you kena covid not staying in hospital nobody care for you your family member will kena too . so better stay home keep safe don ’ t play play .clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands
must close border untill end of the year more safety for singpore
a very capable s pore govt . thumbs_upthumbs_up
this entire vaccine is total bs . the vaccine doesn t work on any of the covid nineteen variants . also you can be fully vaccinated and still spread covid . the entire mandate is total crap !
pap is the best .
"burn money plus time just for a neighbouring trip , totally not worth it ."
sincerelly yours
"if it is just for a holiday , forget it ! returning to singapore goes thru the same quarantine for seven days which cost thousands !!!"
"indonesians make singaporean life so , hard ."
open la .. so many restrictions last tim go there no need visa all why for short term need visa ?
when covid19 dispear from world we miss go singapore again eat food and traveller
"rules travelling to batam and bintan could be relaxed , but returning to singapore will definitely be a total hassle for sure . don t want to be locked up for days and paying thousands when returning to singapore . the move is designed to boost tourism in indonesia and singapore government will never be bothered to help indonesia where they will claim that it is to safeguard singapore but will continue to allow tons of india indians in which is the main reason for the spread of covid in singapore !"
"nobody will go . the usual people going there are cheapskates and quite poor . with these costs , its almost certain the ports will remain desolate because these people will not be able to afford it anyhow , plus travelling space is limited and not the entire islands are open to tourists . its commendable that the indonesian government is making the effort , but its not going to work .... yet ."
shn seven days when coming back is a big obstacle . wait for vaccinated travel lane ( sea ) to open .
now is almost all omg . it is no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated people . as far as they are clean . all welcome ... it is good for our business .
what s the point of this travel bublé to batam because we can only be allowed only vacation in nongsa batam island not other place in batam island except nongsa ? what a waste of time going to batam only restricted only at nongsa batam only thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down
"as indonesian malaysia message for you singaporeans , do not forget say thanks to bill gates and the gang thumbs_upmedium-light_skin_tone"
mistress time . mating season
better don t open . stay at singapore better .. cannot go anywhere ..
only within the bintan resort or batam resort area . no allowed to go anywhere and to pd pcr test - all cost abt three hundred sgd and come back singapore kena quarantine some more . not worth the travel or holiday .
"yes not worth waste money , we cannot travel around batam , back singapore quarantine some more face_with_open_mouth"
"hmm , so the journalist or delegates went to bintan for this meeting . so when they come back , do they serve shn ?"
jahangir ahmad why is it not required ? so the covid virus do not attack journalist nor deplomats or those on special arrangements ?
jahangir ahmad not asking if i am right or wrong . just a question why is there a different treatment for normal visitor and this special people ? that is the biggest mystery
muhammad nasri must be an equal but the question mark will be remain for ever and ever
jahangir ahmad so the lope hole is not to be a normal visitor . hahaha . having a status is more than enough to fight covid . even vaccine is useless
"so much hassle , yet can only stay at the resort ."
who will travel ??? triple pcr test + insurance . this cost alone is about $ two hundred and fifty . haven include the boat cost which will cost more for vaccinated travel lane .
yes malaysia parents have a chance to go indonesia
"really shows the intelligence for policy makers to think that singaporeans would rather spend $ two hundred and fifty for pcr tests to fro and travel to batam / bintan for two - three days holidays and then return for seven days stay home , instead of traveling to further countries for longer holidays ...."
it s all about control .. they will never ever let the power go .. buckel up ppl .. more clot shots are coming ..
cannot buy dried shrimp and anchovies . only allow to move within resort area .
"do not waste money and effort lah . so many restrictions and protocols to follow . unless so desperate to travel , by all means , go waste money on to go - singapore pcr , batam pcr , then back batam pcr , singapore pcr . then hotel , food , and anything will cost a bomb . better wait for normal travel"
what a useless update . for what go batam if cannot go anywhere only bintan island only . better i waste malaysia money go sentosa more better . better not need to open the border .
"singapore giving up the indonesian air space is the reason indonesia is allowing travel - in by singaporeans . covid is just a farce to use to subjugate people . suddenly , it is not an issue anymore . haha what an obvious farce ."
"why don t you guys just ask for money directly .. instead of fooling united states with words such as quarantine , reopening , shn , pcr and bubble"
woit gundu we have to quarantine foreigners no quarantine coming back here make money we have to fork money some more got go to school or not
"do not trapped in the pharmacy business , just wait and patient , let us the big country which have big pharmacy at war price ."
it indonesia who have been separated since the lockdown in two thousand and nineteen . do have a heart to consider their swift reunion red_heart
those enjoy the benefit of both worlds
responsible for all the death you because . murder .
"as a gothic , i will provide a travel experience when visiting indonesia for seven months . i will tell you honestly because i don m talking about the whole area of ​​ indonesia , tourist attractions in indonesia are crazy . saved in the heart . explore more than fifty tourist attractions in indonesia , then you will know that indonesia is very amazing ."
do you know about in bali ?
"g w i don t know the place , but malaysia favorite tourist attractions in bali are the lake and mount batur"
"yes .. you have to have adventurous soul to travel to indonesia . skyscrapers , shopping malls , casino , etc is not indonesia re from the mining industry , not fine ."
"kuda jingkrak but it s true what you say , the number of tourists in indonesia is relatively small because it is only ranked 30th , when compared to malaysia , thailand or singapore in southeast asia . but whatever it is , i like nature tourism in indonesia , because it is different in each region and it makes me have an amazing experience and impression . yeah , this is no joke ."
"agnesiya cordelia creamora its called as eco tourism , what we indonesia has strong value is nature , tradition , culture , etc skycrappers is boring just man - made , nothing compare to god made ."
"kuda jingkrak there are too many natural tourist attractions in indonesia , i know more than thousands in total . therefore i only visited a few , but i wanted to return to visit the ones i had never been to ."
means don ’ t need to take booster shot anymore ah wohoooo
i do not think singaporeans in general go to indonesia to see skyscrapers .
"zz7722 the typical tourist of each country is different , for example like me , as a gothic person , it is more directed to nature tourism and studying it . because for me it has a very different satisfaction when compared to man - made tourism . if only for skyscrapers or other man - made , no need to travel far . because every country has it , but it is different from nature tourism . every country has its level , for indonesia , i judge that natural tourist attractions are unique , different from each region and many ."
don ’ t make sense at all . most singapore visitors go there for short getaways so it is still too much hassle to go through for three days of vacation . or actually two . five since half day is needed in indonesia to take the pcr test ! i expect it to fail .

but ferry fares 88sgd and hotels sky rocket . one trip at least three hundred $ burned making you pay for their losses . i would wait
when johor bahru is covid - free i go there walk for 3hrs is free . money thing sorry . johor bahru is the only place i ever would go for free only shopping does cost . sentosa is malaysia place to go for now but not frequent . quarantine nah not going until covid - free .
"omg another new talk cock guys no knowing what is happening . one minute this and another minute that . ong ye kung , i think you need to be very sure before implementing new things . making singaporean very sick to listen to all your stupid suggestion and later put the blame on singaporean not careful and caused the cases to goes up ."
hmmm do this place on dream cruise ?? too
"even with 2nd shot and booster shot , the regulation is remain unchange . people still being locked in one country . this covid is a bio weapon to speed up digitalisation and and introduce future meta verse into our society . remember , without covid , people will not bother invest in nft , crypto , blockchain , etc . this is what they called , master plan"
"ssst face_with_medical_mask thanks to bill gates , zuckerberg , and the gangs"
trust me better do not take this stupid trap advantage .. this is all to make citizens / travellers as an utmost reason virus is spreading more .. this is all hidden political agendas .. at the end who s at fault ? normal people ..
"putting all the restrictions and inconvenience aside , i appreciate that indonesia is opening up to allow our people to travel there . hopefully more travel corridors would gradually open up as time goes by ."
"limited movement to only the bintan resort area , what a joke"
it will be wise to avoid leisure travelling until the protocol has revert back to the pre - covid era . we ll keep our money by sitting down to watch their tourism industry and full scale economic collapse . and then followed by a repeat of may1998 civil unrest .
very true !
who says no covid end game . - - who chief tedros
it s easy to spot the truth because truth will never change ... while the who ... dr fauci and most world leaders are flip flopping with their neratives ... judge yourself ... victory_hand

all the tiko uncle rushing to batam soon .
like your father
"not worth going there even pre - covid lol the ferry and immigration alone was a hassle , imagine with multiple checkpoints and pcr testing etc ."

their kpi to salary ratio is way down low . to japanese they would rather jump down or resign but singapore leaders thick skin still stay on for money . like parents like children shame to their children as when you take something you don ’ t justify you are actually begging ! house of beggars that is !
quarantine free but they ’ ll poke your nose 100x . no thanks . malaysia friend had infection after the gov pcr test !
they recycle the test kits lol
nobody would bother with so many restrictions and tests . and sure they will jack up ferry fare as well .
oh trust me . everyone will
"fluffers if they do , very soon there will be lots of cases in either singapore or indonesia or both and they will stop the arrangement , just like what they did with vaccinated travel lane flights ."
haha …… one sided announcement again …….
it s a major source of revenue for the government as well .
stinkapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may ( no masks no safeentry check in ) since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying_face and this is called political science nerd_face not science rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
this government surrounded by absolute oligarchs
"also , they have an incentive to give false positives as it means extracting quarantine hotel stay revenue from travellers ."
chandra hartono ... don s globally planned power shift ... shifting whatever wealth left on majority ordinary people on earth to the one % sitting at the top ... this is the new normal ... great reset ... nwo ... you can call it whatever you want ... it will only lead to a single agenda ...

that great
"not only go batam for shopping and eating , it also for people who has wife kids in batam .. they been apart almost three years .. even malaysia father , family most of them in batam so we all need to be together again with malaysia family again ."
wait for vaccinated travel lane ( sea ).
visa is for people going there for work with a company work permit for the batam company not for personal reasons like visit your wife and family members . and the vaccinated travel lane is for fourteen days only .
"restrictions to stayed in nongsa ferry terminal hotels and bintan resort only , for singaporeans have to stayed in the hotels and pay $ thirty , zero as insurance for covid - nineteen ? cannot leave to batam town for shopping etc ? yet , return back to singapore have to shn for seven days ? who wants to pay such money ? this is not logical , like this staycation in singapore or sentosa even better by using $ thirty , zero staying for seven days in singapore much better ."
"only can stay at resort , cannot go shopping . who wants to go ?"
"travel bubble it not work , those who fully vaccinated should give them a freedom way to visit any place location , believe me it may not work travel bubble ."
only booster allowed .
so if social distancing then don ’ t need mask ah ?
"if it s more expensive than ktv visits , the uncles will not take the ferry"
get a mistress in batam . cheaper than ktv or not ? why not have a mistress tax ?
credit to the capable s pore govt . thumbs_upthumbs_up

"its ok . if he gets stuck , lee hsien loong speaks bshasa v well . also mandarin and russian"
english is not our first language . pm sabri can speak english if he wants
afiq muqri I am saying malaysia is a third world country which is the fact .
he looks very grimacing_face nervous .
look at how the singaporean pm speaks ... wish our pm could speak well too ...

"malaysia ranked 2nd for many years and currently 3rd in english proficiency across asia . so not so far behind . plus you don ’ t need to be ‘ advanced ’ in english to be a developed nation . just look at japan , china , south korea or even indonesia . proud of their language ."
"fazril yup , it including those minority talents that working overseas . it brings the ranking up ."
at least it ’ s forward movement ….. malaysia vaccinated travel lane tickets during march holiday all gone already .. pls open for cars to go in too … no need quota came back from liberal europe after two wks there no infection where as malaysia friends stay here got covid … no need so strict already .. can relax more
even yr sultan of johor spoke out against this . ie malaysians forced to speak bahasa malaysia . he said how can malaysians compete when all their important lessons are in malay . he also said its like living in the middle ages .
lou ong they are chinese educated . also the way they speak is the mainstay of their jobs . making people laugh . the crude hokkien . our spore govt is trying to improve the way we speak . without singlish . as a sporean i do agree our english is good but not up to par . i listen to some hong kongers . they speak english so well .
fazril up to you ...
"english was spoken by many during the 70s . late 70s , something happened and the powers that be started to insist medical students be taught in bharat . it was a disaster since medical staff started to migrate to australia , new zealand , canada and other countries . book were translated into the javanese bhasa which is full of sanskrit and tamil . malaysians could not master what is literate or high grammar and vocabulary quickly enough . indians and chinese had to privately educate their kids so they could keep the country on the map . politicians like dumb down malays becu they can steal from the country . malays deserve good education , they should demand english ."
i would like to say that our pm can speak very well in english as i am able to fully understand what they said in the meeting . the gist of communication is to let listeners understand the meaning of the speech . that all . and is as simple as that . 所有類型的疾病都不像戰爭那麼糟糕 ， 感謝上帝
"his english a huge disappointment . no energy , no spark ."
next is another pm ya
"i wonder why would you go back to asia at all . more and more people are desperate to move out of cities like singapore , hong kong etc . to the west , in order to actually live their lives instead of staying scared and restricted forever ."
love him from skorea . he is the one of the best politician .
actually it is not a sin for a malay to rule a country

"the good outcome of this pandemic is that both countries is closer than ever before since one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five ."
"amity so true ! i also cannot understand why these politicians make a big fuss over the use of bm . when they sprout utter rubbish whenever they open their mouth , it is sure to rile the right thinking citizens . nothing is in their mind but to create chaos and discontent . bm may be the official language but does that mean you should restrict others from using it in official functions and for the pm to impose restrictions is unbelievable . all the pm s b4 him have used english as per situation . english is an international language and all literary books are in english . bm is full of words borrowed from tamil , hindi , english itself and god knows from what else . so why the fuss over the use of english . it is just too bad that some political people do not want to upgrade themselves to be marketable internationally nor locally . energy should be chanelled towards improving the economy and inviting foreign investors to invest here . inceccent talk of racial and religious issues has already chased foreign investors to singapore , thailand and india . as long as bigots sit in important posts , malaysia will slide to the rock bottom of the ladder ."

"would these happen if mahathir is still in charge ? maybe , the border will be close permanently"
maybe malaysia prime minister needs to improve his english ?
"( replying to noh abdul shukor ) in fact , there is no purpose to compare which pm can speak better english . they are not english language teachers and they are not here to teach english language . many china citizens cannot even utter proper english sentences and yet they are surviving well in singapore . people from various asean countries that do not speak english are also able to work and live in singapore . the ability to communicate in english does make life easier in singapore , likewise knowing malay language make your life easier in malaysia ."

"amity payah jugak nak jawab ni haha . agreed that the state of corruption is of greater concern . also , agreed that the abusive nature of the minister is more apparent than his command of english . however english is also the lingua franca of the globalized world . not so much of whether it is a western invention or how fine we are doing without it but rather due to its homogeneity , english is practical and usable in international and business affairs . much like the wearing of t - shirt and jeans ( a western invention btw ), its popularity works in a similar ... fashion ( pun intended ). think of english as a tool . nothing more . the current president of the united nation is abdulla shahid . a maldivian at birth , he is able to deliver his speeches fluently in english despite it not being his first language . many past presidents are also not ?"
so low quality
datukalien again you miss the point . but trade with other countries are burgeoning
come on malaysia give ur pm a chance . he s trying his best . love fm singapore . smiling_face_with_hearts🇸Gambia🇾
it s lingua franca is malay unlike singapore which is english . he could just speak in bm as pm lee is an intelligible speaker of malay as all per all the past singapore pms like goh chok tong and lee kuan guys need to chill out and look at the bright side for once .
"lol , doesn t he said want to improve bm position , then why he is using english during the event ?"

jessie james singapore t he speak bm here instead ? i believe singapore can understand bm also
太初 not all will understand . but we would get interpreters if that was requested fr him to speak bahasa . but i do not understand why all this criticism . at least he does read and speak english we can all understand . he will probably improve in the following yesrs . i know some of the junior ministers speak very well . heard them speak
"jessie james kj could articulate well in english as he was educated in singapore oxford university . the others who are proficient in english are ku li , rais yatim , nazri aziz , hishamuddin etc ."
everybody is comparing singapore pm fluent of english korea president for cannot speak english ?

"wrong ! its not just english . its the technicity in the speech . singapore pm can speak english , chinese , malay , tamil . singapore ministers are highly qualified and under a meritocracy system . malaysia only berhasa malayu and only malays dominate the country through racial system . this is the difference ."

"do you know that once upon a time ( before 90s ) our english equally good with singapore ? the change of curriculum and medium of instruction in the 70s and the implementation of racial based quota system contributed to deterioration of mastering the language . don t forget that english is still the most important language in malaysia than bahasa in majority dominant field in this country e . g law , medical , accounting , finance and in private sectors . the actual fact is you have to know bahasa if you got to deal with government sector . korea , japan , china are well known for their hard work community , a historical culture and their contribution in research and development especially in science and technology field , that is the reason they are proud of their mother tongue ."

if those malaysian were to miss their country so much . probably they can stay back at malaysia for longer period of time .
those malaysian has a job to do if they stay longer how are they supposed to support their family !?
these malaysians chose to stay in singapore for work reasons and they have been there pretty long not being able to see their families and this is the only good opportunity that they have to see their families again without going through two weeks of quarantine which costs them money and if you have faith in your government than believe that they made the right decision

what is the rush to open ? cannot they wait another two to three months

christmas and chinese new year otw dunno wat will happen . while you choose to earn more overseas be prepared for the consequences be safe
tomorrow will always be tomorrow .
we need to test the efficacy of the vaccines ..
lim doris all countries are having this problem .
"why can t wait two to three months ..... if you grow money plant at home , you can wait in your bedroom for another ten years ."
money . johor and malaysia no more money . so many business in johor shut down . malaysia begged singapore to allow this vaccinated travel lane despite high covid cases
"pakalu papito what a joke .. m s about the workers and singaporean who have house and family there .. this border opening benefits mostly malaysian and singaporean who have property , business and family .. such a stupid comments you post ."
omicron is coming ….. faster than getting the data
"easy , different definitions of for foreigners and singaporeans . we have to take booster , foreigners no need ."
ishaki kenobi ya hahah until their people have to cross border . they still can scold united states when we are the reason some of their people got rice bowls

so it s a win win for both countries .
"this guy has a point , you guys cannot even rebut him . what has that got to do with buying cheap grocery and whatever ? do not deviate from the statement . why do not you guys come out with a valid arguement ?"
"monka eternal mine is not valid ? singapore also got cases , we are also bringing cases over ( if pcr tests dun work )?"
"jacq low i cannot really tell who is from where btw , if you think yours is valid , sit yourself out . I am waiting for those who mentioned about what I amh and what not ."

by population singapore case much more worse than malaysia .. even johor total case much more lower .. don t be salty ..
"sweetkiller xx agree . without quarantine , who spread to who also don t know ."
"jp phua you must understand that people cross border with testing and only those tested negative allowed to go , nobody here letting them roam freely , i think the government knows what they are doing , both countries have their ups and down .. live with it ."
"sweetkiller xx again i agree with you . you need to chill . not everyone is against malaysians . both governments are taking risks . johoreans get stereotyped by singaporeans . singaporeans get stereotyped by johoreans . it s always been that way . we , on both sides have to live with the decisions both our governments make . we have no choice ."
"precisely . indonesia faster to recognise novavax , and now sgp follows . united states , europe n israel already hv similar test results recognising natural immunity almost as effective as fully vaccinated but still no reporting here . natural immunity has been discovered still active for sars since then , unlike annual vaccination needed now ."
jp phua lol maybe because you re still replying to me despite being told not to ? you . must be really illiterate rolling_on_the_floor_laughing

great news . thanks to the responsible and capable s pore govt for taking a calibrated approach to opening up .
capable yet covid cases 3k daily lol .

dear god … just zip it already . total bs at work !
lisa lim it is just exhausting on top of listening to lawrence n his team excuse explained themselves away every other day .
this is making me reconsider going to korea in april ... seems like a hassle
no reason to travel from one gulag to another gulag .
"and now ( ten dec twenty-one ) south korea is having its worst outbreak since pandemic . thank you vaccinated travel lane , i guess ??"
don t you really know yet that vaccinated people infect each other and transmit the coronavirus ? how is it possible ?
singapore is spreading virus through vaccinated travel lane . first germany now s . korea . both countries are having its worst outbreak since vaccinated travel lane was established two - one month ago .
need electronic visa ? I am travelling for seven days only
"well , we might as well maybe a few more months waiting to travel as what you seen here such troublesome getting everything paper in order and the waiting in long time will so tiring especially for the senior citizens . unless there some matter important things to do then okay but if going for a holidays better wait a few more months rather having situation like refugees chaotic trying to go somewhere ."
it is a good move to have vaccinated travel lane with south korea . a lot of people like to have a break after two years of the trauma . living with covid is like this
too much trouble but south korea is still safer than india . at least i don ’ t have worry about malaysia daughter being gang rape on a public bus .
open to ceca and all the employees liao
"last year before the existence of the covid vaccine , one / five of patients were covid patients . but after the vaccine existed , almost all patients were detected covid , the majority of patients in the hospital were those who had already completed the vaccination . ards lung injury ( lung injury ), pneumothorax ( lung damage ) due to forced ventilator machine . all of this is due to medical protocols ! not the result of covid disease !"

a western australian police officer has been admitted to the hospital following an adverse reaction to the covid - nineteen vaccine which saw her suffer a stroke caused by blood clots . this is a good illustration of the brain make - up of vax fanatic .
"restrictions will be totally lifted in the next upcoming year towards 3rd quarter two thousand and twenty-two . going now is no point , many place and shops still closed if you exit seoul . in seoul , also not everything is open . and too many restrictions still in place , better to wait til mask off ."
thorough process indeed
pap media lackeys are singing to the same tunes in order to make the country a super spreader .
ammazing shorts ! :)

"why not using rain coat , lol"
all that to go on a vacation ... damn i miss the days when you could just book a flight and go the next day .
in addition to a free x - ray scan .
its such an hassle also can never put mind at ease especially when sudden lockdown imposed and get stucked in there like prisoners and thats sad .

we are doing very well with low icu occupancy rate . the mtf is doing a very good job .
"unvaccinated lives matter : limitation for unvaccinated travels is to protect the public ? why then do we keep on importing omicron , covid - nineteen and many more covid - twenty-two next year ? i think it is not to overwhelm the medical services and facilities ? with more than one hundred imported cases , will it not flood the medical facilities ? will they pay for the medical expenses just like the innocent unvaccinated citizens who pays taxes , serve national services , pays double - interest for housing loans , save money for govt through cpf ?"
"us indonesians used to look singapore s effective handling of covid with envy , i guess that is not the case anymore ."
"didn t the public tell you vaccinated travel lane is foolishness ? only for the money , whatever happened to the useless changi connect plan ? if these are effective , why is the infection continuing ?"
high level . 4th booster coming soon .
we ’ ll be playing pandemic for another year
the ministry task force is a joke . singaporeans do not respect the mtf . everyone knows this
"should go full removal of restrictions for anyone ages sixty and below . only boomers are occupying the hospitals , not united states youngsters"

those travelling to malaysia are mostly malaysians working in singapore who have not seen their families for long period of time . that is the main purpose of this vaccinated travel lane about ; to let families or long distance relationship to be together .
if there was a contraceptive vaccine . yes people . it really is that stupid .
"with the increased and imported spikes in covid - nineteen cases , where did the omicron and other viruses come from ? who brought them in ? it cannot be the unvaccinated since they are not allowed to travel . hmmm ... why are they discriminated then ?"
then why allow vaccinated travel lane into singapore . all affected are coming in to singapore to aggravate the situation . disgusting .
only complain complain please la pathetic
"just to get it . if i ´ m healthy according to the rules of back in the old days , like really going far back in history , like back to two thousand and nineteen , i can not enter singapore as a random healthy not vaccinated foreigner ? that will prevent a lot of business people to come and deal another blow to the tourism industry ."

what has / what is the point of asking people to take covid test before taking a flight if the infected are able to board the plane
- iswaran sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore .
fk off la why vaccinated travel lane still need so many effing testing ?! the new procedure makes no logic and sense . stupid govt .
"to live with virus or not ...... this is a really hard decision to make . while we are proclaiming to learn to live with the virus , we are not doing that ."
must close again six month singapore much better and touris can not antry untill one year two thousand and twenty-three
that pore govt .
"it all depends on what restrictions other countries have . singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia ( among others ) did , too . it creates a competition for tourist dollars , investments etc . basically , opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others , triggering a virtuous cycle . it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions . if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements , then singapore will likely follow too ."
completed disappointed for such decision .
- iswaran sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore .
so singapore s government completely lied about living with covid as well . i wonder if their citizens want to shut off to the outside world or open up ?
"can t stop omicron , only slow it a bit"
"instead of temporary shutting down the vaccinated travel lane when omicron was detected , we are now paying the price due to our reckless govt . lucky the virus is less severe than delta otherwise there will be more deaths ."
well said . that s exactly their playbook from day one .
"the masses will be incepted into the matrix of the dajjal by leaving behind their culture , race , religion , caste , social status etc . that is the motivation we re experiencing now ."
so during this period till 20th january are we still allow to travel out of singapore ?
full flip government la want to open don ’ t want to open . kana sai

"19k cases yesterday and yet today simplify rules for travelers . open doors for covid - nineteen to come in is stupid , repeat the mistake is stupid , believing in peoples action party is stupidest ."
it has been the peoples action party way of governing
alot singapore citizens do not realize . that the peoples action party government always pass laws and things go wrong they change .
"they are always on trial and error . like a person who fail his driving license test but somehow got it through some means . has no clue on the direction to any destination , no gps device to guide , just going round and round in circle .rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"
- iswaran sounds familiar ? another anthony faucie speaking here in singapore .
"ya lah obviously , everything in this world is trial and error . if something go wrong you obviously want to change to improve the condition , then what ? just leave as is to make the problems worse ? if you are any better then you govern urself lah i think everyone die alr ."
"hang tuah hastinapura do you think the human race is already so smart at this age and we can prevent anything from happening ? everything in this world is trial and error . what we are experiencing now is very new , it is not like the sars virus back then . no one in this world can play god , not everything is determined . we can only learn and improve ourselves through trial and error . singapore ’ s actions against this virus is already one of the best there is the entire world has to offer . if you are not happy then you are free to go to other countries where their leaders are much more ambitious and do whatever they think is right and end up killing thousands . governments can make mistakes , but their decisions are often well thought out with many people and there are more pros and cons , plus and minuses , and trade offs that we still need to consider , something that your little mind can ’ t think of before making that comment ."
"re destroying their own peoples action party next generation as well . no proper schooling , saf without proper training for two years ..... every day fooling people just go online . peoples action party is in for s long decay and certain death ."
so what ?! 19k so what ?! majority are having mild symptoms ! look at our poor businesses that have suffered from this pandemic ! if we do not allow the tourists dollars to flow in how will they survive ? they will end up dying of hunger or worry whereas majority of vaxxed c + patients will not die ! guess who s the stupid boy !
"obviously some pappie lapdogs believe they had tremendous reserve that can last them for hundreds generation to come without even have to work , or ensure all spore citizens have gainful employment without all this unwarranted disruption in the name of covid , that is where their arrogance come from ."
tis happen to the transit flight in the fis place y allow to transit ????
"stop cross border travels , stops the spread . simply : if you know of a place that has the virus , don ’ t go there . if ur there , don ’ t leave ."

"while vaccinated may still get the virus , this is because it is not one hundred % effective . the vaccines are much more effective against preventing death or serious illness than remaining unvaccinated"
"mi p even so , enough data already showed the risks are also very very low for unvaccinated ppl , especially for generally healthy bodies . perhaps the urgent push for mass vaccination is to cover up the inconsistency i just mentioned above . i ’ m not against the vaccination so far if a person is convinced to take it . but the direct and indirect mandates are seriously unethical"
"good observations . instead of focusing on one self immune system , assuming every single person has aids and with that assumption forcing or coercing everyone to accept the experimental jab ."

"this virus has the ability to mutate into more harmful variants unlike malaria from nopheles mosquito , as the breeding grounds which can be controlled and destroyed . i am saying therefore , this virus must be treated with zero tolerant and human cannot coexist with it . for example , from wuhan virus to delta variant which have already killed millions . given time , the mutation may wipe out human ."
i am saying the usage of the word is misleading singaporeans for others selfish gains while the elderly are dying everyday .
"as i have said long time ago , and it s outright risky . endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure ."
ttkoh123 you think covid can be eradicated like malaria or polio ? hah
uk we ’ ve agreed that vaccination against covid - nineteen won ’ t be mandatory
marc gourde well said ! we should expel these clowns out of our society at all cost
"c brtdgh firstly , go get a proper education in english comprehension ."
sixty-five omicron covid cases detected in singapore . single party is unwise and dangerous .
"as i have said long time ago , and it s outright risky . endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure ."
"basically if you choose and had to travelled through vaccinated travel lane , no need to complain , basically this is the post pandemic travelling pattern or sop , else forget about travel . visible fighting against invisible can and will never be easy . no human on this earth right now right here knows or can know how the next moment can be , upon the mercy of the virus . unless really urgent and critical , don t waste time and money as inconvenience there will be ."
the border measures against this virus are futile . we should not let this virus control our lives . it is endemic and is going to stay with united states forever just like the cold or flu . i quickly booked malaysia flight today while vaccinated travel lane tickets are still being sold .
"mi p now is pandemic , not endemic"

active is preventive measures while reactive is waiting for things to happen despite worldly information .
reactive ministers ? what is the objective ? cheap human lives or enterprise business more important ?
"regarding the drugs / vaccine , i heard goes thru tamasek [ unless i heard wrongly ]. malaysia question is why cannot govt buy direct instead of passing through another middleman hand ? do they have private investors funds manage by temasek ? are the drug / vaccine one of such investor funds ?"
"also , why award to termasek and not goes thru tendering process ? and they will say termasek own by govt . but then salary cannot review or declare and secret . then they say is private . transparency or opaque ?"
that single party is unwise and dangerous .
pap is playing with fire
that s the way it should be like agenda21
"cases need to rise for lockdowns or travel restrictions to lose their effectiveness . so it s a reason for celebration . only a rising case number beyond control can force abandoning restrictions . examples plenty , european countries , australia , south korea , vietnam etc . i said since the beginning , the pandemic will last as long as restrictions last ."
"i am one of his clients .... and i am a living testimony of expert john noah . he has changed malaysia financial status for the best , all thanks slightly_smiling_face to malaysia friend who introduced him to me ."
please keep selling the tickets . please send all of them back . then after that we closed the vaccinated travel lane lane so they cannot re - enter back .
meaning from 23rd dec till 20th january we can t travel out from singapore also ??
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation

what s happening to the high efficacy western vaccines ? omg
triloler thirty-nine we in endemic lah
boring
a bit slow to react and to curb the spread of omicron .. person_facepalming female_sign
why was i forced to take vaccination then middle_finger
in light of the forecasted antcipated spread of omicron . mayhaps about two weeks too late to reduce the vaccinated travel lane flows the reaction was unnecessary on hindsight .
"on , off . on , off . open , close . open , close ."
so sad vaccinated travel lane on hold after things were looking up … wanted to visit seoul or istanbul …. singapore malaysia should try form a bubble .. it ’ s only separated by a 1km walkway
sixty-one % voted for weakest team ever 4g circus_tentclown_face
spaide man singapore is better in handling natural disaster . doesn t rely helps from neighbouring countries . singaporeans voted reliable political party as the government .
omicron already occur when the land vaccinated travel lane occur . and how stop ?
they did not hold their nerve .. so much for living with it ..... good thing they can still draw their salary w / o fear of money coming in . rgl not brought back ... how to run businesses ...
juz open the border .. no point
only ft will go take vaccinated travel lane . vaccinated travel lane for foriegners . not for singaporean . peoples action party serve them
"of malaysia friends and relatives here in singapore , ninety % travelling are locals . in particular travelling to countries with winter season , such a skiing in korea , i have not the slightest sympathy . seeing the own family , that i still understand ."
peter kroll so ? why should a govt go serve ft ?
vincecarlo the remaining thirty-nine percent voted for dishonest clowns like raesah khan from workers party and brad bower the anti vaxxer from psp . cmon oppies keep coming ! you guys voted for the best circus in town !
blizzaroxxx lol how do you even know ?

richard louis the one that raised you .
petrus romanus thank you for verbalising malaysia thoughts .

many poor countries also as if nothing is happening .
"african nations also dismissed hiv , ebola , tuberculosis , polio , measles ... c - nineteen is breakfast in bed ."
open close open close open close . what t they learn a lesson after the outbreak ?
singapore making the same mistake like the previous variants . then blame unvax .
"south africa already over omicron despite low vaccination . we r giving it to children , god bless !"
do you have any better suggestions ? this virus is tricky and approaches must be nimble .
bs . no point when you still have vaccinated travel lane travel .
what when even a kid can see it coming ... import over local ..
why cannot we just stop flaunting to the whole world that we have got everything to break out of this pandemic just to go back in it deeper than before .... spare a thought for the healthcare workers .
rediculous they just don t learn or adapt the virus is less virulent and too fast to contain . plus people are vaccinated but treated the same as if vaccine never existed .
stay home is the best .
the case numbers don s treated as a common cold unless you are the singapore government are nothing but cowards .
i think is abit too late .. that time discover first case of omicron in singapore must already stop the travel . some may had got omicron but without symptoms going out to eat and spread to others . with mostly haven ’ t got their booster shot is quite dangerous .
"this is a continuous relaxing and tightening cycle to transit united states into the new world order agenda . anyway , be prepared for a cyber pandemic which will made covid - nineteen look like a walk in the park ."
"she is sitting in a high rise office building , you really think this travel companies towkays would feel any pinch if this safety measures is taken ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!! offf course not .....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

why only between singapore and malaysia ? what about the rest of the vaccinated travel lane countries ?
precisely what was shown in many clinical reports worldwide but not in local media .
it blocked as of now it too high for cases
"uncle john toh , is to avoid omircon caronavirus transmission . other s not sure . must see lastest new . at this moment better stay in own country"

why fda needs fifty-five years to disclose pfizer vaccine information to the public while only took three months to review and approve ? what to hide here ?
nice for opening smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes i like singapore
"opening of causeway border is too much of a risk to take , controlling and handling the traffic volume with detail checks is highly impossible . hope government can seriously this decision , not creating another regret again . now with opening of various vaccinated travel lane and stabilising on local measures n system is already good enough and strenuous on the team , on the people . opening of causeway border is going to create a big bang to united states again , all vaccinated travel lane all social measures for locals will be affected again ..... singapore might still remain the vaccinated travel lane but other countries might not want singapore . we need a stable opening up , not a huge risk opening up , risking what hv been achieved pensive_facepensive_facepensive_face"
when there t think either side of the nation want to take the risk just for short time access .
"the lancet in the united states and germany , high - level officials have used the term pandemic of the unvaccinated , suggesting that people who have been vaccinated are not relevant in the epidemiology of covid - nineteen . officials ’ use of this phrase might have encouraged one scientist to claim that “ the unvaccinated threaten the vaccinated for covid - nineteen ”. one but this view is far too simple ."
our art kit is like our vehicles prices . it is a few times of the factory price . what is the because of this . why are we paying so much more . who is making money on the horrendous mark - up !
the factories that manufacture the art kits don t get their materials free . the store that stock and sell the art kits are not charitable organizations .
"thulomanchay freaking pea brain . just for an example , those similar art kit is selling one quarter of the price in malaysia as compare those selling in singapore ."
they are deploy in the multi task force to play the squid games .
they claim that they are slowly relaxing the restrictions to avoid you - turn but the fact is that they are doing a roundabout .
my opinion is that it should be open for tourist and those returning home . not day tripper that will make it difficult to control . perhaps two to5 days minimum visit . hope will not return to pre covid nightmare going through the custom .
"malaysia cases still high , stupid idea to open the land transport for malaysia . and even our cases are still not stable yet don re too noisy and bad air pollution !!"
with this people giving directions to the moh the outcome would be treacherous .
moh already under a china loyalist . they are going full on to make sure they make money from their investment in biontech n pfizer .
singapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may ( no masks no safeentry check in ) since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying_face and this is called political science nerd_face not science rolling_on_the_floor_laughing
did they decide it or just reading a script
"daily pass on are all vaxed people , hardly one unvaxed person pass on per week ."
stop . stop stop vaccinated travel lane with malaysia . their government and it people s always threatened singapore to turn off the tap . no water supply to singapore .
shouldn t we get our numbers to low 100s before opening up ?
how to get below one hundred ? do another circuit breaker ?
uk is ninety-three % and a wave is incoming lol
chitchat maybe we should learn from sydney . they did it
sabrina c what do you think they did right ?
chitchat they locked down for four months straight until the numbers went down .
sabrina c so do you suggest we lock down four months or four years ?
chitchat lock down until the numbers are low as per malaysia initial comment
"sabrina c after lockdown , the number will go up again once lifted .?"
"people commenting negative , they think they are in comfortable position and worrying not to become worse . let us thanks govt first for keeping united states comfortable . and let us understand govt is now trying to recover economic condition for better tomorrow ."
may you live forever .
"again same rubbish conference . instead of preventing the covid spread n deaths , the govt continue with their reckless decisions to open borders to more countries . in the past 47days we have lost five hundred and four lives which is eighty-two % of the total covid mortality since our 1st covid death in mar two thousand and twenty . in the past sixteen days the covid mortality has increased by sixty-two % as compared to last month . this clearly proves that singapore is in critical covid crises n yet the govt brags about their covid measures . to them its collateral damage to lose lives for the sake opening our borders . what a incompetent govt !!!!"

pfizer s action party is working hard to spread the virus through vaccinated travel lane .
mmtf ... believing they having blot clot ... can t think anymore ... becoming like newsreaders ... ninety % vaccinated then why still discrimination ... unvax .. newsland ... open up after ninety %... we must compare with taiwan and hong kong only vaccinated rate fifty-five to sixty %... learn frm them how they manage to control the spread ... we are not in europe or united states ... always compare with them ... look at europe ... there is surge in covid19 ... even after vaccination ...
this is what you call safety wow we every week open ten countries loll
our opinion does not matter .
"super spreading on behalf of pfizer , its like free advertisement for the boosters ."
we have money face government !! putting knife on our medical team and singaporean !!! singaporean should wake up must know who to vote for the next election !
they have no clue

singapore is heading for big trouble . the western world and united states democracy and human rights are shit nonsense useless and declineing
i m surprised your comment can be safe . malaysia comment was been deleted . lol
singapore went from the safest country to the sickiest country with unhealthy people everywhere and high number of deaths per capita daily . it is sad really .
in the other news : unbelievable
bullshit will take you right to the top but it s would last long
"a fifty-two - year - old prominent new brunswick cardiologist who shamed the unvaccinated over the summer died suddenly in his sleep after getting his third shot of the covid - nineteen vaccine . dr . lutchmedial died unexpectedly on november eight , just two weeks after getting his 3rd jab on october twenty-four ."
don ’ t be racist pinoy lol
malaya harimau many similar cases happens overseas . old trees had alot of dead and rotten branches . mother nature pruning of the rotten healthcare system is underway .
"seventy-three year old chinese man with no known medical history of illness but was still in the workforce and smoker + drinker , took the booster ( 3rd ) pfizer jab on the 17th sept two thousand and twenty-one . he usually lives away from family in a rented flat . he was nt able to eat well recently he was sighted to be looking weak while sitting down in a playground prior to being sent to the hospital via an ambulance ."
mumbai hospitals witness fifty % rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks guess what s happening in singapore hospitals with eighty-six % fully vaccinated .
restricting unvaccinated ppl is to protect them ?! why not restrict those who didn t take the flu vaccine ... i thought gov want united states to treat covid like flu virus ??
looks like they wanna increase the number of covid cases . gonna discriminate till the end of next year .
"they once said that vaxxination campaigns can prevent large - scale infections and deaths . you became guinea pigs before , and your children will follow your destiny ."

how can india n indo get vaccinated travel lane without quarantine ?? unbelievable
two thousand cases ………
more vtls but singapore s vaccinated inhabitants cannot even dine in if there are more than five . bunch of jokers !
i think the student pass and the quarantine are two separate issues . you might want to contact your school or mom to check on your pass status . all the best in your studies .
a calibrated approach by the task force is the right move . a responsible and capable task force .
"there are missing links in the overall different approaches in an overall strategy in moving forward . we need to really prepare ourselves . with our open travel , new variants are sure to come ."
what about nursing home . somrpe
less than one hundred cases per day per one . four billion ppl vs three thousand cases per day per five to six million ppl . work out the math .
foolish guy doing maths on wrong data
"it is wrong to force the non vaccinated to receive experimental chemical vaccines like pfizer and moderna . the healthy younger non vaxxed group do not pose any danger to the community . leave them alone . all your experts have been echoing only what pfizer and who say on paper , but did your local research teams validate the efficacy of the vaccines ? if vaccines so effective , why three thousand infection cases a day ? that s the elephant in the room !"
not just talk cock saying they already help singapore pls do not lock them they are human
what s the point of taking precautions when you leave your main door wide open ? really silly policies . thumbs_downlight_skin_tone

if the gov . says ll give them thumbs_up n vote for them !!

oyk and his bicycle . still going down slope after one week . wonder where he finds such slope that you still don t try to be a smart alex . ong ye kung probably came up with such name as circuit breaker . think of reaction before making any more analogy .
oyk is considered the smartest among all the smart alec within the rank . hospitals across mumbai are witnessing an almost fifty % rise in emergency footfall of patients with heart attacks compared to the peak pandemic period in the second wave .
"sample sizes not large enough only in the context of singapore . i remember reading an overseas study where their results were different , and their sample sizes were larger than ours . i think that study was done in the united kingdom , and it showed that p - p - p resulted in a marginally higher level of protection vs p - p - m , but the same level of increased protection was not seen in m - m - p . overall , the results of that study seemed to suggest that those who took p - p for their first two doses , would do better with a pfizer booster shot vs a moderna booster shot , while those who took m - m for their first two doses , would see no significant difference in protection regardless which booster vaccine they received . i don t remember already ."
"hong kong with zero covid policy , closed their door lockdown areas with covid cases . daily cases on the rise with breaking record each day . don ’ t seem to work for close door policy too !"

bmpcos as long as i m a singaporean it will always be malaysia business . being ruled under a bunch of clowns that do things without considering the consequences of their actions is indeed both worrying and frustrating . how about you be the first one to go overseas for holiday ( preferably the ones that are experiencing winter now to get the best effects of covid )? let me know if you get sent to the icu because of covid yeah ? all the best !

"icu cases one hundred . leas testing means less casss , numbers can be easily manupilated"

so inefficient . what happen to air vaccinated travel lane for thailand and cambodia . thailand and cambodia already open to fully vaccinated singaporeans but singapore so inefficient to open to these two countries . alot of singaporean business and staff effected and families separated . cambodia high rate of vaccination but no response and action from mtf . thailand by december which is only next month will hit seventy % fully vaccination rate .
u can travel but it s not free you have to pay for the vaccinated travel lane lane almost $ five hundred dollar

"vtl is exciting but the more important thing is to set a target time for clearance per passenger . otherwise the queue will be very long with the excuse more checks is needed due to covid . the gov to gov should be able to share by now who has been vaccinated so there is absolutely no need to check these at custom again and waste everybody ’ s time . if security is a concern , treat all travellers as default vaccinated and only share bet gov for those who are not yet vaccinated . for the swab tests results , custom officers should check early before the passport booth ."

it s necessary to open up to malaysia as we are interlinked in many things
"a cautious , responsible , capable and forward - planning s pore govt . encore !"
well posted . we have good ministers
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face - to - face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october .
"so , let total infected children from twenty-three oct two thousand and twenty-one to nineteen nov two thousand and twenty-one alone is nine , nine hundred and fifty-four numbers"
"prof teo on the nineteen nov two thousand and twenty-one said , but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate , i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources , because at this stage , the daily number of infection is undercounting the number of actual infection happening , given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore , many people who are infected will not be tested with pcr test to confirm , and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers . and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection , it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community . and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly , we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require icu care ."
"bloomberg ’ s covid resilience ranking , singapore had drop twenty places to rank at thirty-nine even worse than africa . maybe only can fool some sixty-one %, you say ?"
hope that both country must be optimistic and build a better future .

"lawrence wong said [ twenty-six jul two thousand and twenty-one in parliament ] - “ as we do so , we must expect cases to rise , partly because there is stI shall / I will on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level . also , as we open our border for people to travel without shn , we wI shall / I will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time , but at that stage as you heard just now , [ our main focus wI shall / I will no longer be on daily cases ] numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus , they are much less likely to become very I shall / I will .” [ note : capitalized words ] why must they keep importing from higher risk countries ?"
as i have said yesterday ; i think they will relax curbs for business context while implementing more protocols and fines for singaporeans .

"for example why has the subject of long covid and the govt , responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients been avoided ?"
"why no professors or the govt are addressing on this long covid issues ? why reporters aren t posing the relevant questions to them ? it has become clear that , for a considerable proportion of individuals affected by covid - nineteen , significant clinical manifestations may persist after the first weeks of the acute symptomatic phase , with a heterogeneous complex of subacute and chronic symptoms that preclude a full return to the previous state of health . this persistence of symptoms , which may affect patients of any age and with varying degrees of severity of the acute disease , has been recognized as a specific clinical entity , called long - covid ."

"this restrictive mobility on human volume only encourages human traffickers to resurface again , just the same as contraband cigarette ."
black market inevitable . govt is not clever by only providing so little entries . even if ten thousand on both sides it is insufficient . a modest thirty thousand will be more reasonable . however people are at the mercy of this cruel and heartless government will just have to be contented with whatever is been dished out . if the government is hoping for appreciation and gratefulness they are dreaming . only hatred and disgruntled people on both sides of the causeway are waving their fancy fingers to celebrate this ugly gesture to their respective government in treating their beloved citizens . people are not human but digit to the both government .

alexandria school of science johor is hermit state where nobody . go to their airport while singapore is the international hub . got your fact straight ... even super strict hong kong also already got .

hopefully the system goes well ....
"bermunda it will not be possible to eradicate the virus , it will remain for thousands of years , but acting in the right way . that there may be another occurrence of infections is the fault of the leaders of each state who allow , without any precaution , the non - use of quality masks and the moving from one person to another . this , as well as the stupid 2g and 3g rules were thought - without really thinking - that they are therefore useless , because many of the supposed vaccines are completely useless , that – which number in the millions and pretend that so many people have actually been vaccinated – are completely useless and mislead even the heads of state and responsible epidemiologists , virologists and physicians about something that is not really there ."

opening for house visit for five paxs
"some key covid - nineteen facts , if you re interested :"
"uk research shows that vaccinated people s peak viral load is same as unvaccinated people in home recovery settings . and by inference , vaccinated people will also pass their virus to others in similar close settings as much as unvaccinated people . so , why put the blame solely on unvaccinated people ? mtf needs to do homework and keep themselves abreast of covid research developments instead of just conveniently using unvaccinated people as scapegoat for failed policies . already unvaccinated people are kept away from many places for more than two weeks . infection numbers have not abated at all . this proves that unvaccinated people are not the ones causing the three , zero numbers all this while . unvaccinated people are being witch - hunted"
it just shows how cowardly the governments are and wanting to make a covid - nineteen a business
you can re talking about four digits ! so what if our weekly rate drops by twenty % - we still have two - 3k cases which is a very high number for a population of five . 5m ....

we have to be realistic and stay united with the govt to get the good results . no policy can please all

is it true for the below ?? something hidden by big farma ?
"one . c - pass tests to check on anti - body levels should be considered for returning citizens , prs , migrant workers vaccinated in certain countries where certification is not so reliable two . kids should also have access to non mrna vaccines ."
did they really go below one on infection growth rate : just because the less on certain days . the rate just happily goes down and even the cases increase by almost a thousand the infection growth rate when down instead of up between eight nov - nine nov . guess is either typo error / human error or screw up data . data for moh website . !!??
are self tests and home guarantinees considered ?
"l thinks you should questions those who are infected , why are they not following the safety measures than talking about the infected rates . stop are all nonsense questions and stay safe ."

if the vaccine worked they wouldn t need any retrictions
"f williams if vaccine did not work , many of you whiners would already be floating down the ganges river"
yōkai three hundred and sixty-nine no . it s been two years since people were dropping dead on the street in wuhan . since then mostvdearhs have been elderly .
dine in should be restricted to one . so ppl only open mouth to eat .
since you want to keep forcing me to get vaccinated with all your policies . i will make sure the next election you will not get malaysia vote .
so you voted for them the last time ?.... lol .
"five from same household ok to dine in at restaurants , same as five foreigners ( probably not from same household but maybe same country ) coming for bloomberg forum . a married couple can dine in at parents ’ house but they are restricted to dine with their parents at restaurants . i wonder why ?"
are you sure every country will send five delegates ? ….. bloomberg will more likely five participants from different countries sitting together dining and probably more talking amongst themselves than having food in their mouth . i think most restaurants will follow what they did last time …. continue to restrict all diners to two persons a table to be safe from violation regardless whether they are from same household or not . this rule hard to enforce and is a fail .
"so many ads ... literally one every few mins , the speaker hasn s another ad already . channel news asia , how much money do you wanna make from this ?"
what has / what is the point even bosster can get effected .. this happen to malaysia friend mom ... unless there is the cured for covid instead of vax ...
"a cure is definitely somewhere out there , whether we r allowed access is another issue ."
"i know this is very off topic , but aren t those people who ask questions from like media companies ? how come the way they speak english when asking questions sounds so non - media company like non - news like , like very chor lor ? imagine going to consult like a mathematician and he seems to be struggling adding up numbers ?"
that ’ s the way most singaporeans speak
"hong ng true , normal singaporeans . but they re in media professionals ."
shawn i know . so embarrassing . this happens when our schools do not emphasize on speaking proper english . most singaporeans like to mumble and swallow their words when they speak . we do not speak clearly .
"announcement is easy , but there is no planning ahead to ensure vaccination centre , restaurants etc are ready , after announcement it s confusion and mess , where is the efficiency we were once so proud of ?"
double standard restriction is not helping local businesses and own citizens . it caters more to outsiders coming in .

so what ? what s the point of living when you have to worry abt making ends meet ! and the worst part ? the likelihood of dying from covid nineteen if you are jabbed is super low ! so why worry ? the tourist dollars however makes a huge difference to our hawkers and our people . do not be selfish

mark zuckerbird so those diners eatimg with their mask on is it ? how silllly billlly you are .
"boba fett what are you talking about ? you are drifting further and further away from topic . with loud music be it recorded or live , one needs to talk loudly to be heard whether f b outlets or ktv . geddit ???"
mark zuckerbird so that means music to be banned everywhere here it ? so you mean people will talk loud only when recorded music being played ? go visit coffeeshop and hawker and gymn you will hear some loud stuff over there so now you are the one got drifted away from reality geddit ?
vaccinated should not wear mask since mmtf claim they are protected n unlikely to die .
thumbs_downthumbs_downthumbs_down
bmpcos vaccinated . they are the super spreaders without knowledge of their own ability to spread because govt gave them false security

"more people vaccinated and more people infected and died , what is the point of vaccination ? if residents are not vaccinated at all like last year but got very small figure in infection and death compare to the current situation , which you prefer ? obviously , wrong vaccines are being used and wrong strategies and tactics are being applied is the main causes behind , look at hong kong , taiwan , mainland china , macao , singapore is the worst affected region with chinese government , shame on you peoples action party , and now you shameless ministers trying to push responsibility and finding excuses some more , government should responsible for the death and the current serious situation ."
we have chinese heads but ang moh thinking
mark zuckerbird wrong look at china they r forcing on children
lol kuala lumpur chan singapore doesn ’ t have a chinese govt what r you talking lol

vaccine works ? yes or no vaccinated person the vaccine will minimised the severed of having covid nineteen ? yes or no are we live with covid ?
where is the easing of rules for unvax ? no improvement ?
"achilles , may i ask you something ? since our gov cannot lead but always follow the you . s gov , can we , as citizens , also learn from the you . s citizens , to talk about human rights and protest ? thanks ."
"achilles rodriguezxx thanks . then only peoples action party got the rights to do n say ? what about we citizens ? nothing we can do ? i mean our gov follow you . s gov n we citizens follow you . s citizens and we r wrong to do so , not fair ."
they already going after the younger ones and already fired the warning shots with two new regulations taking effect from dec and one jan onwards .
that just means they have no confidence in the vaccine .

"they are showing that , we are simply relaying on foreigners ."
"yea you did , use your logic la , did you really think such small singapore will rely on singaporean that have proved to the world with only hdb complain phenomenon ?"

"are they sure it s safe to open up ? in the past , there were sixty , zero tests per day . as of last update , only twenty , zero tests per day . fewer test means fewer case , does not mean the covid situation getting better ."
test yourself . no country can have such resources to test so many people dailiy
"our g is very smart , con and corner eighty % to take experimental drugs for big phama and secure investment deals with them , both gov and phama co legally not liable to be sue , at the same time show the world we are highly vax and now open for business , one stone kills two birds ."
justfair it is not about the test but the statistics . they aren s safe to open up .
positive cases using art test also not included in the numbers they report so actually not accurate
"vincecarlo you can also base it on infection rate . there are fifteen . nine % positive out of twenty , zero who gone for pcr test . in the past this was zero . one %. clearly the situation is getting worse . taken from google stats ."
our g is absolute fool . the smart one is nothing but a gang of highly educated new world order mafia in collusion with the bigpharma and bigtech . such dysfunctional g brings nothing but suffering to the citizens .
i hide malaysia test paper from malaysia mom when i fail the test ! so that no one know i m lazy .

do not vote peoples action party . do not vaccinate your child .
what has gun barrel got to do with covid ? quite imaginative in the wrong way
because lee hsien loong peoples action party government is no longer in control of singapore . through ho ching the new world order has infiltrated and is now in full control of singapore . we are nothing but social and medical experiments now .
coz they don t want the stupid people to become smarter lol .
"just wait till the mandate comes for everyone to get their daily pfizer booster shots . ooops , not a mandate , sorry . you can either get the daily shot or not be able to step out of your house !"
why would people want to travel for pleasure in the thick of covid19 pandemic ? one need to wear mask in public and restricted number in dining in or groups . in addition need pre - event test at some venues . moreover delta variany infect both vax and unvax . does this sound like fun ?
foghorn d told you once before and they will tell you no more . what is it ? education and ability . lacking one is bad enough . you owned two . congrats
justfair yes . i . no study hard . but at least i know a fart is a fart . smelly . but it seems to all here that your master fart always smells like rose to you . hmmm .. how could you tolerate that . i wonder :) could you kindly enlighten me .

i guess i will start traveling after one more year .
"if you want fairness , then go and get vaccinated . infection can spread from anyone , vax or no vax . no choice ? your own guess ? medically certified ?"
"how long will it take for the cases to go down ? lockdown is the only way to get the cases to go down but for how long ?? then when they ease the measures , goes back again . then what ’ s the point ?? it ’ s endless already la . covid is here to stay . just face it"

in the other news : discrimination at it s finest .
vincecarlo it s all about big heavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signheavy_dollar_signeyes
the government should have ensured booster shots were rolled out to more people before they start opening up .. this would have given more protection to those whose vaccine had waned esp in those people who are elderly or who had comorbidities and helped to reduce the severely I shall / I will and deaths . on balance i think the government was hasty resulting in unnecessary sufferings and deaths .
do you really think these boosters work ?
please also realize that many die / suffer permanent injuries from boosters due to daily too . these are not reported !
check out vid by geert vanden bossche insidious face of pandemic variants and you will see why boosters and vaxx - cines are harmful
depopulation process is undergoing .

"after giving 4k as ‘ pittance ’ money to our healthcare workers - which can only be credited in december , they have now decided to tip them further off the cliff . no wonder we are ranked one hundred in the covid nineteen recovery index with indonesia and malaysia ahead of united states . the ‘ leadership ’ lacks empathy , direction and is clearly discriminatory against the unvax . where is the transparency in reporting numbers ? hiding something ?"
hope ong ye kun and kenneth ma will be thrown to jail soon . these son of beaches now wants to push kids for the vaccine when there is not even one single death cases among kids five - eleven years old in singapore . how to even justify the risk benefits ratio ?
gahmen think singaporeans life too long izzit ?
why are they all not wearing masks when not speaking ??
they are robots immune to covid .
because they are all hypocrites with double standards
they are elites ... elites do not wear masks when speaking . only peasants have to wear masks ...
"mask is just precautionary measure ,.. look at ang moh countries … full house stadiums singing cheering standing side by side each other maskless"
they need to lick the nwo feet before and after the talk thats why do not need wear laaaa
brutal truth i know but can you see the double standards ? there you are asking people to wear masks and failure to do so will lead to $ three hundred fine . but here you are not practicing what you preach . how to take them seriously ?
andrew lim bcos sixty-one % voted for them . errr
do not vote peoples action party . do not vaccinate your child .
it s hard to breath and they know it
as we all know how effective masks are especially when viewing formite transmission compared to air vector . but hey keep doing as your told and watch as your owners do what they want .
james lim whatever you vote will not decide who is in power . their puppet master nwo the one to decide . not only in singapore but everywhere in the world . wanna be free from them ? then risk like war in mid east woozy_face
hmmmm .... next election will have mail - in or vote online options ... for election integrity ....
just like how joe biden and the left wing liberal democrat liars stole the election
singapore peoples action party government used the same dominion machines
why not jest lockdown

slevin gaius hold on longer . these vaxx - cines got lt side effects major illnesses like alzheimers parkinsons etc
"slevin gaius have you tried looking for alternative employment in the meantime ? your health and life is worth much more . once you take the poison , it is a point of no return ."
mark zuckerbird you do realize that this will be enforced island wide right ? it s only a matter of time .
slevin gaius there may be some compassionate employers . mtf said fire as last resort . some will use this as excuse to get rid of certain employees . but perhaps there may be some who will show compassion and hire unvaccinated people and may those employers be blessed
mark zuckerbird not worth it imo . catching the virus and landing in the hospital will incur financial troubles . and its getting difficult to move around . it is what it is .
"slevin gaius vaxx - cines got lt side effects that are even more costly to fix . alzheimers is one of side effects and recently a drug was approved for emergency use for alzheimers that cost 56k . for twenty years no drug approved for alzheimers . but they know vaxx - cine will because alzheimers ( one of major illnesses becaused by vaxx - cines ). so , they quickly approve drug in time for vaccinated people who will get alzheimers soon"
demark is running a full trial for united states to study as they fully opened and ditch away masks at the vaccinated rate of seventy-four %. its been a few days since they goes back to pre pandemic . let us hope they will do well and we can follow them soon .

please for once govt please understand and pity united states no job ... listen to the citizens dun open yet
want jobs than have to open up lah ….
no jobs so he wants lockdown got freebies
brutal truth depends on which sector and industry you talking about . only few are affected by non - opening of vtls
need open up allow foreign workers in not just open for vtls … due to shortage of workers govt stop issuing new tenders until workers situation improves … by apr twenty-two some of malaysia colleagues workers will be out jobs already as their old projects are in final stages

"singapore september twenty-three - there are ten suspected cases of cerebral venous thrombosis ( cvt ), or blood clot in the brain , among those who have received the pfizer and moderna vaccines for covid - nineteen in singapore . can the ministers tell united states what s happening to them ? have they fully recovered ?"
"many more vaccine injuries which are swiftly covered up by the media . common sense should tell united states that if it carries a risk , it must be a choice . clearly the highly paid people are unable to comprehend this ."
vincecarlo what happens when one day someone pull up the carpet ? or strong wind blow off the carpet ? all the skeletons would shown up . big pile of skeletons under cover now .
"official report on the local media is only tip of the iceberg . thousands out there bearing the pain and long - term side effects too sick too old too poor to get help . when they go to iris koh for help , she also got censored by moh . what a shame moh . acting like mafia ."
do not vote peoples action party . do not vaccinate your child .
"one : nine hundred = one thousand amongst nine hundred , zero travelers , at its peak just need five days . implying one thousand : five days [ based on previous peak ]."
james lim peoples action party are really murderers . just got an update that this person passed away this morning . he was forty-six with three children .
vincecarlo still pushing covidiot conspiracy theories . your insanity .
"better do not open up so soon for land travel , ie the causeway . 300k daily in and out is a thing of the past now . such a big number is no joke . there is no way to control such a large flow of ppl , n def no resources to hse them even if just a tiny percent was infected or asymptomatic when at the causeway . furthermore , news said malaysia got some fake vaccination certs , how the f singapore customs got enough resources to check thru that ???"
ya please we cannot control the ppl here liao please please they waiting to march across folded_hands

for almost two years so sad
open land travel faster … really need a good vacation … very expensive for air travel now .. korea will charge s $ two hundred and fifty per pcr test and airplane tickets are ridiculous … only rich can enjoy
"when these malaysian gets covid while in singapore , the government will house them in facilities . remember a lot of them do not live here , so no place for home recovery while singaporeans have to take care of themselves under home recovery ."

"since the vaccine discrimination started on 13th oct two thousand and twenty-one until today 8th nov two thousand and twenty-one we have eighty-six , two hundred and twenty-eight cases and three hundred and fourteen deaths ."
"utube1024 currently , there are 221k cases from what i read , how come yours is only 86k ? thinking_face"
mohammad salleh 220k must be the total cases to date . i am saying from 13th oct till now .
mohammad salleh just to make a point the unvaxxed in eateries are not the sole contributors to covid . this discrimination is uncalled for . will stop inputting data until the vaccine apartheid is lifted .
utube1024 they do not disclose those death are vaccinated or unvax . must be too embarassing to .
"two , four hundred and seventy new cases clearly shows the rubbish mrna jabs n discrimination not working"
only one tested positive ?? a negative test at the airport on arrival doesn t mean he will not test positive later while going around spore

"john five thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four malaysia dad was one of those who passed on . he has / he is unvaccinated but when he was in icu , everyone else was vaccinated elderly w complications . before malaysia dad died , some of them had passed on already too . covid pneumonia can happen to vaccinated elderlies too n it can be fatal ."
"shadostorm malaysia condolences . malaysia dad passed away suddenly without covid . when one is old , there are many possibility of death . its all about our health and immunity . vaccine can only help but primary importance is our body immunity ."
the unvax don t get to use malaysia tax money to pay for their stupid decisions .
yōkai three hundred and sixty-nine y must unvax pay tax to support vax ?
yōkai three hundred and sixty-nine stupid decision r those who vax to get marginal protection and key covid nineteen infection spread contributors
woofwoofchs the mouths of msm are stuffed full with money cannot speak of facts properly
"yōkai three hundred and sixty-nine stupid or not remains to be seen . comment again ten years later after it is proven that no long - term side effects . plus looking at stats here and elsewhere with high vaxx - cination rate vaxx - cines are proven not to protect against severe illness and deaths too . vaxx - cines do not stop infection and spread too . so , who are the really stoopid ones ?"
"markt n it is very sad , culling of population worldwide . worried for the children . they have a long winding road ahead full of hardships after taking vaxx - cines . reputable docs in united states said that children will be clients of pharmaceutical companies for life bebecause vaxx - cine will because all kinds of major illnesses in lt and these cost much much more to heal than covid itself"
mark zuckerbird i dunno about the first two jabs but continuing every year is nonsense .
"markt n if you check vaers of united states , many reported adverse side effects ( in the hundreds thousands ) from 1st two jabs but they were not reported by media . same will go for booster shots . biggest cover - up in history"
why is pfizer and moderna not debutting new vaccine against new variants like delta . obviously the current vaccine is not working as it is based on the original covid nineteen virus . sinopharm is debuting new vaccine against delta
des chan please go back to kindergarten and learn english again . your entire paragraph does not make sense .
mark zuckerbird checked fact from insurance companies “ longevity reserves ” as they ’ re reducing that in anticipation of lower life expectancy .
vaccine must not be force . it should be own decision .
"such a cold hearted measure for seniors who are not vaccinated . if they fell I shall / I will , regardless of covid infection , they might hesitate to see doctor for the concern of medical cost . here you are suggesting them to suffer and die alone at home in the worst case . you regard them as suicidal and neglect them ."
"thats correct , cold heartless !!! especially there is zero compelling evidence to show unvax is the problem ."
stop whinning
ya is very cruel to treat our unvacinate senior .
pray to god . he will punish them .
“ the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members .” - gandhi .
i don t trust anyone that treats other people this way
brutal truth what they do is none of your business . do not pretend to care . i believe you are vaccinated . why are you so afraid ???? do you think its safer in crowded aircon bus and mrt ?
"eighty-four % vaccination rate but exponential rise in cases , clusters n deaths insanity"
"john five thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four lol … you think i care and am afraid ? i am saying seniors also don ’ t care so don ’ t use them as excuse to criticise govt"
these old folks survived world wars only to be treated like a leper from this administration .

do not vote peoples action party . do not vaccinate your child .
"let me be honest , even if you are , you may not want to go see doctor unless it is serious . one of malaysia elder friend got a slight fever , book to see doctor , already got well but still got five day quarantined without seeing the doctor ."

dolly tan friend fwded this to me . what would you say about moh civil servants if you face them in such situation ? just got an update that this person passed away this morning . he was forty-six with three children .
otw to four thousand cases per day . soon all singaporeans will be covid recoverers or victims . pls note there are two variants that are not affected by vaccines .
趙子龍 provide the evidence
adding more ministers into this task force has no positive impact on covid nineteen situation . it only show more are incompetents . why bother ?
"only know how to complain so much , don ’ t see you go do the right things also ."
psyco headz pls bark elsewhere
"eighty-four % vaccination rate but exponential rise in cases , clusters n deaths insanity"
which two ?
tse hong ling why take a vaccine if it won t protect you . if it did no need to protect the vaxxed by barring the unvaxxed
"psyco headz refute , no barking"
"can unvaccinated claim from vaccinated if they get infected by them ? also , still no news from pfizer ventavia leak or does channel news asia leave this to the real journalists ?"

yea .. because those five gundus at the table are actually from the same household .. riggght . seems totally legit .
alzario to cater to the expensive tastes of expatriates
we still believe ... united states .. cdc .. fda ... god save united states ...
its because theres still ample space in hospitals for covid patients
most whiners believe in their self induced fears
justfair its normal . it happens all the time .
five stones .
end of the tunnel ... we see smoke ... rip seniors ... condolences to their family ... singapore boleh ...
"if there r ample space , they do not need to resort to stay home recovery"
thank you .. i lost malaysia dad last week to covid . he died as a martyr . i miss him and there are many more families who are mourning out there .
"half baked measures ; open to five dining but only to same household , vaccinated travel lane with malaysia only by air . duh !"

you must be drunk to comment indians are coming lol do not even anything just comment anything you like
lisa lim you and me in a locked room until you open up your zero
south asians must be more careful after discovering they are more likely to have a gene that makes covid more deadly …. pls stay at home and lockdown until this virus disappears

hk juz closed off ppl from new zealand . are they allowed into sgp ?
"( before the vaccine arrives ) obviously , the purpose is only to help vaccine manufacturers to get data . not to save people lives ."
markt n new zealand is not as bad as the other countries we accept into our vtls . germany just reported highest cases ever . united kingdom and united states continue to see record cases . wonder if mtf is trying to set another record for our country by admitting all these record infection countries into singapore
"mark zuckerbird … that is , if whatever they said is all there is …"
markt n cannot believe what govts say anymore . every one has an agenda
mark zuckerbird governments are now under the big global mafia government now .

the tightening and easing of measures are strategies not to overwhelmed our medical workers who are tired and stretched . sooner or later we all wI shall / I will be infected . the only difference is those vaccinated face lower risked of getting seriously I shall / I will .
what safety ? what guard ?
so can peoples action party govt finally keep the tourists under fourteen days quarantine now ? we know it s safety
lesson of the day is next ge we can t remain as one party rule .

"good job olivia , you smile a little bit . great to see the anchors smiling now ."
vote somemore for them . then complaint . pointless
china and you . s have created this biowar and as usual rest of the world is suffering .
sharp and clear summary
"i already prophesized there will be new variants one month ago lol . once you enforce vaccination , the virus will mutate to new immunity strain ."
whatever la
if the world realised after every major events in a country ... there will be new virus mutated and spread ....
do not throw away your masks yet !
omicron is an anagram of moronic squinting_face_with_tongue
"singapore govt is strange . when its time to make quick , decision , immediate action . they are silence . this omicron virus is highly contagious , it has shown to replace variant d quickly in some countries . it has mutated thirty-two times , making existing vaccines ineffective . fully vaccinated were the carriers n spreaders . immediate action needed to curb entry n quarantine , they sit on it hoping for miracle . if omicron ever enter singapore , it will spread very quickly and is not the bunch of highly overpaid incompetent can manage"
if the government can prevent omicron variant from spreading to singapore then they have at least redeemed themselves .
"haha opening more travel bubble will perpetuate more spikes , as the new virus nu is more contagious than delta . now is the best time to work on alternatives instead on hyping on the benefits of vaccinations ."
testing two
while many countries are shutting off incoming visitors singapore for the sake of money is opening up . be patient . we will pay the high price . no way of prevention .
respect covid people not scare covid beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes
as a lot of countries is pulling back traveling . our ministers is still promoting it . putting the our country into the highest risk . we know now that the new omicron is very highly affectionable and is immune to the vaccine available . can we start to recall our vaccinated travel lane ?
and because of our governments greed . new variants enter singapore . they are really only thinking about their own wellbeing . it s time for a change no more corrupt officials and that particular family that controlled singapore for centuries .
"can we invite someone with a medical background to speak on the new variant ? the focus was completely off for me - with this new variant , what seems to be the concern here is the impact on travel . that is not having a big enough worldview . what about the impact on our society , healthcare and our people as a whole ? i came here to find out more about the new variant . didn ’ t expect to hear some stats on travel ."
‘ exhibit ’. how disgraceful and demeaning to a species known as the king of beasts . !
"the only sure thing is if people themselves are responsible , thoughtful and proactive ."
"the rich is not rich enough . need a new variant to transfer more wealth from the lower and middle class ( taking from their small pensions and forever print money and low interest that the rich can afford ). feel sorry for rich people , doesn t own everything ! the shameless global politician following the rich instructions ."
"interesting analogy , you forget one thing , vaccination to bring in alot of $$$ to its manufacturers !!"
"ms mawii ’ s friend went to a twenty-four - hour clinic after getting a lump on her underarm area , which allegedly appeared after receiving her covid - nineteen booster shot . conclusion : never go and see a doctor for post vaccination injuries ."
"and they think just bcs they speak better english make thm great n trustworthy . the main concern here is the patient s concern , nt english . moron"

his strategy ? what strategy ? he is simply increasing the risk factors .
"sg should not start the travel so fast , once the deadly come to singapore it will be worst affect . the only worry is the front line people . traveller or citizen coming to singapore should shn at the destinated hotel for fifteen / twenty days . for singapore citizens they should not shn at home . if you want to travel then you must think of those living in singapore ."
