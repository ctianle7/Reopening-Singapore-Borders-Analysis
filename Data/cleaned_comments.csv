looks like singapore pm can only come from the fam lee either his wife or son will be groomed for that position soon pouting face

millions of american are living in fears and sleeping in road side with tents and canvas
singapore has made the right decisions to become covid resilience and to open vols with as many countries as possible our economy and sanity depend on these vols
plus open singapore johore bar borders as normal for vaccinated travellers everything will be scary until you do not face it let our bodies produce antibodies to covid trons same as other poor country peoples
its been long close borders please let the borders open give united states the life of working family shopping food many more which we have been deprived vaccinated travel lane too many test and cost are very high with jabs should be relaxing the movement thank you
please open borders and our lives will be normal we have to move on we should move on and johore and singapore borders and reasonable test as long as we have taken three jabs we should step forward and be brave to face it thank you
we should refrain travelling from gulag to another gulag
meanwhile hong kong is falling behind sadly

vol is still too cumbersome since vaccination does not prevent infection you are likely to test per be without even knowing it as this virus is super transmissible when this happens overseas on arrival your vacation is finished if you come back and test positive your job is finished fully vaccinated does not reduce your risk of catching covid just less likely to be hospitalised or die fools tend to rush where angels fear to tread
just here to put the disgusting of pigs
well done malaysia friend clapping hand thumbs up
travel at your own risk
why so eager to travel really think its of or die die must travel just imagine if anything goes wrong and you are stuck overseas
overseas safer than here
this one will caused more virus to spread hope we do not infected people

good riddance rolling on the floor laughing grinning face with sweat rolling on the floor laughing
vol is not the only way to enter singapore
what is the point of a new broadcaster just telling people to refer to the website might as well not say anything
we are going to have ten thousand per day soon just call it ceca variant simpler
single party where is accountability i think is a big mistake
home recovery means to be deprived of it stop pretending compensate all the households and businesses for all the losses and sufferings and unnecessary lost of innocent lives and then resign
what to do people still love pap even though they know its not the old pap god save singapore
as i have said multiples of times before safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
you may have said it multiple times but you are wrong it does confer immunity to serious illness to a very large degree
the danger of the vaccinated travel lane lane doing away with quarantine it takes time for corona virus to become established in the body so a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you wont test positive later on five july two thousand and twenty one by linda geodes
with scientific justification as above please stop gambling recklessly the peoples well being and life safeties away particularly when in view of the omission or avoidance to publicly assure singaporeans no long term bodily damage from covid infection regardless of mild or no symptoms safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
one hundred and twenty three should issued you a of a for spreading falsehoods and manipulation as to enables authorities to tackle the spread of fake news or false information too bad of a does not cover or stupidity
yes malaysia sister is a doctor and according to her and confirmed by many that per is never designed to detect a virus all these scaremongering for almost two years is complete joke
vol travellers will not get infected or become carriers
a you so troublesome thinking face
all these mess for of of face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing did the govt get their priority right
travel lane for ceca daily cases is at thousand high yet we are forcing to open our flight
some people are addicted to overseas travel no travel and no life virus who cares
management by the power switch on off on off on off no brains
for opening of granting free land vaccinated travel lane with malaysia i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
open border but singapore migrant workers cannot going outside grinning face grinning face grinning face grinning face
anyone know if singapore will open a vaccinated travel lane with sri lanka india pakistan etc soon
why is the cost of per test in singapore very expensive sgd of in japan airport is only us a
are fully vaccinated travellers tourists from the philippines allowed to travel to singapore without quarantine
yes to be our maid and clean our toilets
vol johore vaccinated travel lane bantam when is the opening ceremony at woodlands causeway and tana merak ferry terminal
why not for indians why united kingdom and united states there is so many cases every day
hairy was right to make life difficult for the anti valuers we should allow anti valuers to enter the malls church or even the house of pleasure as long as they pay for the art per entry those who got infected by the anti valuers should automatically allow to claim damages singapore should not be held hostage by these of
please open border of bangladesh

hello sir are we allowed to travel to vaccinated travel lane countries on vaccinated travel lane process
when indonesian can get through the border without quarantine
well said clapping hand looking forward to travel again star struck partying face
you mean looking forward to get covid
what if singaporean go overseas and get covid will they able to come back seek treatment
mass import for the asymptomatic they cannot comprehend how big other nation is a the implication of all possible transmissions stats already show vaccination or not still spreading worse after six months when less protected
most countries are in the covid nineteen level three high to level four very high range that is why our government need to move our pandemic to the same levels with them so we can logically open up travel with these countries mainly for economic benefits
the best
this is not i think it is from all burmese bema malaysia judgement armageddon
even open to united kingdom and europe only five singaporean can afford to travel there
even open majority of singaporean cannot afford to go united kingdom or europe face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy all want go cheap country indonesia even close border with singapore face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i think the pandemic have really thought people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job does not mean security
exactly investing in today is priceless because tomorrow is not promised trading bit coins gold silver and cry to secure a better tomorrow
its not how much money you keep but how much money you make how hard it works for you and how many generations you keep it for
interesting most people do not understand the market moves and tend to be mislead in facts like this and always depend on money in the bank very bad idea
when money realize that in good hands it wants to stay and multiply in those hands if you really want to make points out of money you be got you have to take it out of your saving account
i understand the fact that tomorrow is not promised to anyone but investing today is a hard thing to do because i have no idea of how and where to invest in

understand they are trying to revive the aviation sector and airlines not sure if they are helping the local airlines or kill them unknowingly if they can achieve the revenue per seat miles which i think is dicey operating costs can be curtailed else it has it is pressure mounting more flights these are mostly long haul city pairs
singapore airlines must keep their motto a great way to fly and not a great way to die

americans will not be visiting so why because average americans do not even know where singapore is only wealthy americans will visit this city state for businesses mostly asian american business people or scientist
you are wrong malaysia neighbouring family is an american couple who are not visiting but living in so of course an average american does not know where is so just like many an average singaporeans have no clue where is bratislava however there is this thing called google map that you can look up should you need to know for some reason

yes united states is very safe low
please open the country thoroughly asap
i am waiting for malaysia vaccinated travel lane why take so long
malaysia is not listed
maybe dry creating some problem and opposing it
endemic for foreigners enhanced phase one plus for local residents
what about own citizens working oversea typical singapore govt prioritising foreigners again
only who dares to be nostrils swab
can i say we all have to live with covid covid will not go away we have to transition to living with covid now we gotta open up at some point it has it is almost been two years they are other diseases we need to deal with
we already open our borders to heaven and hell no vaccination required god bless singapore we will come strong after covid death nos not important economy important cos we got no natural resources good reason we will work together get over this long live singapore thanks to all the ministers

I had I would rather go job not interested in europe
purpose is to support via not singaporean place of interest money mouth face
this is what happen when you got a team of gov who only care at over or life this lee gonna lead united states to doom by depending so much on others than own
why are all the travellers from the west
is china hong kong to macau so are from the west
china taiwan hong kong covid too low so they see singapore as a dangerous infected nation
feet that was already in placed before this
a new song for all singaporeans to sing from now till election day so as to remind you of not to vote for the pap the song is designed to be sang everyday in every occasion until the resolve inside you rages and motivates you to cast your vote against the peoples action party on election day
of yeah only of daily reported covid infection honestly and opening the country what do you think
border control makes sense only when you do not have it locally like china new zealand etc if it is spreading like wildfire locally and infect of a soon the united states is close to that stage already then obviously external visitors are no more a threat than any local this is the day i knew will come sooner or later since march two thousand and twenty
us united kingdom spain have not been able to control the covid nineteen virus again to very high risk united states united kingdom spain australia india japan etc
freedom of doing whatever they want democracy the virus also has the freedom to out spread face with tears of joy
tuck choose vaccinated travel lane with united states good for our business why no
covid cannot be controlled so live with it
tuck choose vaccinated travel lane to india of for you
now its asia africa era go to africa look how silk road initiation is making ethiopia prosperous black americans already left for ghana because african americans are better of in africa now
lucian what about the safari
same goes for singapore no we need to be in the same shit hole group so that the governments can reap economic benefits from opening up
would much rather be in the shit hole group that is looking toward the future and past the virus would you rather be in hong kong where cases are incredibly low but a return to normality is not in sight at all
singapore case per capita is more than those listed countries
princess yes but singapore boast they are well planned worlds highest ministers with worst performance as usual
really open now to eight more countries to benefit the public it has it is seems very convenient to be just in time for the bloom berg new economy forum scheduled for nov of of in singapore come on just speak the truth if you really benefit singaporeans open up malaysia thailand and indonesia for vol
vaccination rates in thailand indonesian are low malaysia should open up though
so is open up for wealthy indonesians seeking medical check ups and quarantined in five star hotels with 26005 for two weeks quarantine wealthy indonesians arriving on private jets are welcome as long as health department allows them their private of actors will arrange it with the authority at health ministry and they will stay at five star hotels of course average indonesians are better stay at home than spend their money there indonesians are welcome though in the netherlands and after two weeks in amsterdam they can travel to the rest of european countries
it is to support via purely business money mouth face money face if you want to put it that way beaming face with smiling eye rolling on the floor laughing
extends leads to higher virus in singapore
many travelling out of singaporean because other country they are safer as lesser cases of covid to land area ratio
now I am in canada of OF hand
exactly
those who still serve house loan not be able to leave this is the time not to buy any property everything not certain if you lost your job bank loan default you be in trouble
singapore need to have more varieties of the virus come on down
yes like a buffet
borders opened for us wow with ask cases daily
this is why they open to united kingdom so that singapore can have more covid cases can increase foreign countries can produce f10000 fake certificate which looks more real than real certificates
relative to population it is fewer than singapore itself on a per capita basis this is the day i was waiting for when there are enough local cases then border control will make no sense it may make sense to china new zealand australia etc and they can stay in their bunker for sons to come but glad that singapore seems past that stage
high vaccination rates doing booster jabs for over is deaths is below two hundred a day covid will not go away we have to learn to live with covid cannot keep locking down
god of united kingdom producing fake certificate i did not knew this thanks for enlightening me and how does it matter because at singapore airport there will be another test
us why should we go united kingdom credit has totally destroyed us its no longer a place to go to of voted for credit and of are deemed racists worst still united kingdom cops rape and murder civilians and now lead by crazy horse or sitting bull sorry better go to thailand or any sea country
per capita basis please educate yourself face with rolling eyes
seems all are well planned but we are dealing with types of virus which could easily spread verifiable cert issued by these countries are questionable there is no of a guarantee it is genuine we are actually taking chances hoping all this measures taken works smoothly do not be too confident reopening the border need to be dealt with carefully we cannot afford to make mistakes politicians will always be politicians it has it is our life they are risking we are concern
we need vaccinated travel lane between malaysia and singapore family ties that matter please consider
singapore is not ready for many countries their verification method are questionable do not take the chances we need to be sure
family ties travel lane again thinking face then how about vietnam
popcorn corner any friend from china flooding badly over there
entertainment is the biggest industry needed anywhere singapore now has no more clubs pubs as such you opening your borders to these foreigners without the entertainment you might as well close it anyways since non vaccinated is not allowed to dine in than why shut the feb business at of pm is there a problem with increasing the time to at of am
error are you asking vaccinated travel lane for vietnam grinning squinting face
is maid in out matter not important how we local to move on live with old folks or babies but indonesia is not in the list of opening travellers too plus
nowadays open border for one country become political problem not healthcare or science problem
it has it is purely business money mouth face all companies and country interested to invest in singapore are welcome
clapping hand clapping hand clapping hand thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
from us make sure they re fully vaccinated
most are too busy in settling their two thousand and twenty election fraud and any sensible american would think twice before they stepped out the ones who did would higher chances would be lack of brains supporters of ice cream sleazy cheater joe
they are clever at frauds whether open or not they shall they will find a way and of course the government is good at sucking up the supposedly
a hard josef i ray don't understand why singaporeans have an issue with this sucking up when you re a country as small as us of course we have to suck up without the help and money of these countries we cant sustain ourselves take a look at australia they decided not to suck up to china and accuse them of starting covid and look what happened china imposed a crap load of tariffs and australia lost out on a big source of export revenue we need these countries on our side
its called vaccinated travel lane
the vaccinated what about us which lane do we take are we even allowed to book flights
seventy seven why would any country takes in vaccinated when they are struggling with vaccinated
they are not safe because they are not vaccines it is actually a bio weapon grapheme oxide and it has it is caused by toxins and deficiencies
when singapore and malaysia border will open
i want to ask before the border was open we already detect the importer virus from art these pal already vaccinated now if we open the border are importing more
india when it is likely
wait countries with more investment in singapore will get vat first money mouth face we will give japan and rest of europe countries first

the vietnamese government has violated human rights because malaysia wife has vietnamese but i have not been able to meet malaysia wife for almost a year now there is no country in the world that has an uneducated stupid government like vietnam
no come no come one come three four come saying in tolkien
finally can meet relatives in malaysia in europe grinning squinting face good job minister saran for getting things done united states go to united kingdom still need to to ten days very proud that singapore is one of the first country to have so many travel lanes to major countries just need japan malaysia bangkok too
tourists can enter singapore but if they are not vaccinated are they allow to enter the mall
as a hong kong resident who works in singapore occasionally some of malaysia vaccinated friends wanted to come to singapore there's no she but i advised against it as you mentioned they will not be able to dine out or entering malls
fully vaccinated tourists malaysia friend watch the video carefully
the title tells it all it is vaccinated travel lanes if the vaccinated are allowed to travel then is the country who exported them fault liao
francis hong kong is welcome
francis that crazy cannot believe what this world has come to discriminate against people who have not had the vaccine wow
seventy seven i agree with a although I am vaccinated but i respect the choice of not getting it too it has it is a mad mad world we now live in sadly
when it will be possible to travel from switzerland thanks for asking in advance
i think when fully vaccinated people hit of right now only of
one thank you we are fully vaccinated but lots of people in switzerland don't want to have the vaccine they are afraid of loosing there freedom cant understand this
since swiss banks are here in so hence swiss are welcome beaming face with smiling eyes
no its still not possible to fly from zurich to change airport its unbelievable i haven't seen malaysia grand kids and malaysia family since nearly a a years
john just needs a bit more time to finalized vaccinated travel lane with rest of eur japan etc
pm i hope very soon malaysia grand kids are growing so fast haven't seen them for for than a a years its so very sad
john thumbs up people hugging
put red heart
remember guys many of these ministers have the highest and best education smartest too from get from raffles they will think of the best research for united states all we may not like it but those who hear the music are declared insane by those who do not i myself have an in of of a average man am a clerk but i admit malaysia failing and am happy to be led by wise men we will be good
i mean it has it is nice they open up but how would visitors from these countries feel when they cannot dine out in a group more than two suppose they come as a family of a four or more not exactly an ideal way to spend ones vacation this is even if you are of to bear the high cost of per tests to by pass quarantine
i do not really think the vaccinated travel lane is meant for families who are going on holiday it has it is more for businessmen and students at this time
actually there are many attractions still open in singapore that tourists can enjoy for leg the two integrated resorts universal studios zoos museums gardens by the bay singapore flyer duck tours river cruises food centres etc the dream cruises caribbean cruises are also available for booking only perhaps the karaoke lounges and some nightlife outlets are closed
or i mean sure the leisure feb industry which did push for the open up will care i do not care to be honest as i have not been to a local restaurant in two years anyway i am just happy to be able to travel to some mask free destinations
fri do not understand the joke every country has its own sovereign government that determines the policy actions driven by prevalent political winds what is funny or surprising here
bali is welcoming visitors as well I had I would rather go to bali
singapore still do not realise that there are many breakthrough cases in countries which use mostly mana vaccine letting them into spore will infect more sporrans the wrong vaccine was chosen for spore national program and they still do not understand why the figures are soaring even though of are fully vaccinated
india eco flight border open pain usage sir please please

geek raised back of hand agree

racism xenophobic activities paranormal humming by oldies against brown foreigners will become low here after let the dogs go out of borders
saran finally making himself useful by appearing in the mtg conference
since when he has he is been useful
much more useful than you
adit in green on their pads hama
big is just open up to whole world to anyone is vaccinated if you keep using this vaccinated logic damn nonsense
can virus is cumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered or fully vaccinated currently vaccine is incompetent due to vaccine maker adjust to be safe so the victims rate is drop after vaccination litigation is applicable now after politicians fully approve the vaccine this is great liberty status evolution a lot of people having long term serious reaction even death in vaccination before and the politicians still do not want to tell the truth
wake me up when we can travel to malaysia or china without quarantine
china is already without quarantine from last year
qadhafi travel to not from it depend on malaysia and china call not for singapore to decide
qadhafi not true i was quarantine for fourteen days in shanghai last year but this year they require of a days home quarantine which means twenty one days in hotel for foreigners like us unfortunately it is still in force right now
indonesians also want to come but the government has to postpone the travel bubble after a surge of cases in the nearby city state
all these vaccinated lanes are blowing hot air only just look at the number of air planes sitting on the tarmac can see just look at the number of pilots on no pay leave can see just look at the people getting in and out of change airport can see trying to discriminate against the vaccinated you received tribulation
us has more death and infected people than anywhere else if malaysia belongs to china or the us it will surely open up such a racist government
clearly the ministers lack spine to repel united states pressure just way and to surrender to united states demands by including others
countries with same politics are uniting
who already mentioned that vaccine a passport do not work you people are smarter than who
why is this task force not made up of both private sector and medical sector
we are still waiting for malaysia border to open hopefully soon
i thought uncle joe advised united states tourists not to travel to singapore because of the high number of covid cases even among the vaccinated he changed his mind because that will destroy the theory that vaccination works
how about china
one hour old account rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
anyway please come for short term tour only have to return to your motherland after twenty one days with or without covid you still needs to leave after twenty one days
china is busy with taiwan now
in order to dine out or gather with more than two people we have to travel overseas
restrict citizens a open up for more countries to come in tell me how many deaths in those countries that you are letting in
when can go china loudly crying face loudly crying face
just go if china allow you singapore not stopping you
pm a lot of men already miss their mistresses in china low low
long by so allow travel from china hong kong did not reciprocate i think their relationship likely end up the same broken heart
singapore situated in europe continent now rolling on the floor laughing smiling face with sunglasses
super monthly paid of of but full read from script face with tears of joy and he looks uninterested and sleepy face with tears of joy org
honestly singaporeans cant help but complain about anything and everything is a criteria for ministers speaking without a script
is this reciprocal opening of vaccinated travel lane or just one sided from us can we travel to those eight countries under same arrangement
answer is in the video
seven hundred and eighty nine thanks maybe i miss that part plus help to direct me to the correct timing on the video to listen again
speaking during a press conference on saturday transport ministers saran said the vaccinated travel lanes would restore two way quarantine free travel between singapore and the eight newly announced countries as per channel news asia article
yes you can go on tour to these countries
best news in a long time thanks
welcome anyone in the world to test their covid resistance in one of the worlds most covid cases
face with tears of joy
then the vaccinated and the seniors will be more restricted in times to come they will be punished more severely as more vols are welcomed with open arms
if vols are in group of more than two people think they are free to move about and dine in right
how about malaysia or also vac ready us a also high covid case
china hong kong macau open up our covid increased low
if you cannot lift up the restriction then opening travel lane is not an option all the small and medium enterprises is suffering with even tighter measures and you painlessly opening up for more country you boast to have the highest vaccinated population in the world and everything else is way behind those country your vision is pretty bad as you only see what is good for your gain and many people is unemployed here as this people does local people business in heart land and have no benefits from your stupid travel lane opening they wont died of covid by will die of hunger
suggestion singaporean coming back to home country should get a free or a subsidised hotel accommodation limit to once or twice a year
great news but if he have helpers in the house does that mean current she is possible only for people without helpers
malaysia government still do not want but johore royal is pushing already
irrelevant allowing asians in provide no beneficial to singapore is economy
your ignorance is astounding malaysia is one of the top contributor for your tourism may you not know those millionaires from malaysia indonesia and china love spending money in so low
these newly opened vaccinated travel lanes are like the salad bar in a buffet no one cares and makes no difference
eight continues can me here spread but we got no chance to spread sounds fair to singapore ministers fun xxx full off do not talk please tell united states something to make united states happy
excellent speech by minister saran cos indeed we need to open such vaccinated travel lane for united states united kingdom canada europe country and possibly australia and new zealand to boost our economy
hama you apparently you do not listen to the news about financial difficulties in us a us australia canada indonesian business people are much more wealthier perhaps in your mind americans are bill gates mark tucker berg vera wang leon musk face with tears of joy face blowing a kiss face with tears of joy well these people think big they go to monaco switzerland luxembourg not so
lucian who cares
more vols means better days for frontline workers like tour guides and healthcare workers
what about malaysia which have very high vaccinated rates now
high a taxed higher deaths and infection rates too voodoo of
no delilah how about united states covid case and death higher than malaysia
who will want to come singapore with such high numbers of daily cases
lots of peeps with mon
might be nat military forces
i was planning to come from hong kong but malaysia singaporean friends advised me to postpone as we will not be able meet up easily at home nor dine out
you never know until you see the numbers the german vaccinated travel lane flights have impressive load factors many westerners are already living without masks drinking beer while cheering at jam packed soccer stadiums and clubbing like there is no tomorrow you still think the covid case numbers are the deciding factors whether they come it has always been the protocols that are the deterrent never the case counts
imperfect perfectionist then we must open up night life to welcome them
put i cannot comment on that i care about travelling out quarantine free hopefully to some mask free destinations whether they are coming in to singapore or not that is no concern of mine but i also like work from home so an ideal scenario is quarantine free travel for locals but and locally full circuit breaker
imperfect perfectionist now you can enjoy europe massless beaming face with smiling eyes
lets live with sink or variant get ready
i thought its india variant
book already
hello thanks for this good news could you please consider to exempt babies from the rules lots of united states have babies and need to bring them around when travelling thank you

via website down already congrats party popper
when puppy lift up one of his back legs you know what he want to do
opening up more lanes is a booster shot to increase covid nineteen cases for such a tiny country with a a million population the daily infected percentage is high the covid nineteen cases will climb to a level nobody will come

yes if you are vaccinate with their own med gen of
pecos taiwan will not reciprocate taiwanese not stupid

why not sweden
its based on economic importance not health
you can transit via germany with fourteen days transit
put via germany has more cases than sweden does not make any sense this
rest of europe will be next
great job singapore please do not go back on these border opening measures i hope public can understand that the number of cases does not matter when vaccination rate is more than of already ice occupancy is only of a there is no need to panic based on the case numbers as most of cases have only mild or no symptoms
great comment hate those paranoid folks with extreme fear
hopefully your family or you will be in ice even you are vaccinated sky died in flu
of of so you wish somebody to go to ice because they have a different opinion than you wow great mindset what has what is your alternative
of of dude lock yourself in your house do not come out
ram ram lee burger no matter how you open the gap in two thousand and nineteen was a a the opening do not help much
sea so would you like for united states to stay closed off from the world forever idiot
all about money money a what else it seems clowns like you just love to see more people getting covid it must be good if people like you get the virus then we can see what happens
we can expect at least one new variant incoming
india will start complaining about sep variant
what you want is money money and money nothing else
yeah duh to keep the economy floating so that singaporeans will not lose jobs simple economics did not learn before
or simple but not for fools
or do not be so simple mind the gap of two thousand and nineteen was already a and many see were not is good shape for the past few years so it does not matter opening or not opening
of of yeah the gap growth worsened in two thousand and nineteen itself even before the pandemic by closing down we are going to keep sees completely out of business by your logic we are going to completely crash the economy and not be able to recover from it any time soon forget about sees even big techs and corporate would stop their investments here our nation is running because of foreign investments if we lose them we are screwed thankfully our government is not that stupid
or yes they are stupid keep the pandemic dragging that make many people whether sick in home or hospital or people quarantined at home do you think inc happy to see that
of of keep the pandemic dragging you seriously think the government has complete control over a pandemic face with tears of joy face with tears of joy look at history there has there is no such thing as overcoming a pandemic through restriction measures you can have complete lock owns for six months and still not be able to complete eradicate the virus that has that is the reason why living with the virus is a more logical approach compared to zero covid life has to go on too many people have already lost their jobs cannot keep it going like this
or i will get or to address your problem
or you malaysia friend are a man of logic
else how to pay most expensive pm on the planet a of of annul to mayors for dunno doing what
money money money always money in singaporean minds
of of wow talking about logic and commonsense you need to buy yourself a brain since you are so smart you have a solution to end this pend mic or you are just the typical brainless ism that love to pub at everything
of of i do not have solution but you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it in fact the border was already opened but you do not see much passengers in airport the only different is they do not have to be quarantined i can tell you that united states companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient if too many high rank and to staffs get it in here and coughing how can ensure the business continuity
or you can see how hong kong and taiwan do it in fact the border was already opened but you do not see much passengers in airport the only different is those and to do not have to be quarantined i can tell you that united states companies try to minimize the number of business trips as the video conferencing is very convenient
of of i think you have to worry about spa and media corp opening cannot help their business tue fair price you also have to worry people can buy rice and other stuffs from other platform and cheaper service charge
of of you are a joker hong kong can do not open border because they have their grandfather to support them can we taiwan you must be kidding right no scan no case they still got to beg for vaccine you do not know meh you are really so simple minded
of of you people are just coconut with four legs
of of of by the way since you are so so so smart please share united states your great plan and solutions on how we can end this pandemic
of of you can ask hong kong and taiwan how they make it on be king thought he would be the vice pm and seek advice from taiwanese politician of a via george yet know
of of you cannot have brain
of of their solutions is not solutions
of of not solution in the first place you let people from risk country walking freely is a solution you do not freely screening the whole red hell to quarantine the carriers that is a solution there are four fully vaccinated persons died and one of them is around of that is your solution there are several cases caught on a flight by other counties that is your solution
of of hello i really cannot blame you without a brain it will be tough for you to comprehend simple logic is long term lock down a solution
of of you must be the male version type of karen what is vaccination for
of why you do not ask there are more than of of people vaccinated and why there are more than three thousand five hundred cases a day and why there are vaccinated people died everyday in lab environment the efficacy is higher than of but those volunteers were selected from healthy people but in practice the efficacy is around of vaccination can only reduce the seriousness of the disease even flu there are people die in flu every year especially in cool countries flu can turn into pneumonia as the phlegm can stuck in the lung this is basic medical sense and people from cool counties have much concern of it
of of low so what is your point do not do anything continue to lock down and close border as long majority of the vaccine pal do not die from covid we should just press on an open up just like the rest like what you have said we will sooner or later die of something please do not spread lie according to medical research you will stand a higher chance to survive if you are vaccinated get it karen
of of i do not say it is you stupid people incompetent to identify covid of carriers and quarantine them and make the place safe i already said border was already open i spread lie you can check with hong kong and taiwan gov how many passengers from singapore tested positive at pc do you read news paper how many fully vaccinated people die so far
of of the birth rate of singapore is sex and the increment of eligible voters of last be was more than of where are they came from you people keep on importing voters even taxi drivers also know that
of of do you know that how many people die in flu every winter in us rustic

of of who know
of course for survival why are grumbling here if not for money reasons
only for rich countries
yes we are a rich country
money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face
what the of you people
wait wait wait visitors from united states without quarantine with the current situation of more than one hundred thousand cases a day
yes the great us a sad to say this but what united states want united states get and the singapore government will not dare to say no
yeah and our close neighbours like indonesia and malaysia which is well under control with the former even having daily cases lesser than singapore they keep close person face palming male sign
pm already said sooner or later a will meet covid nineteen as long you vaccinated and young got higher chance to survive
him does not really answer to why they let countries like united states and united kingdom in where their cases have skyrocketed but yet prevent our neighbours from across the border from coming in
amir vaccinations rate all these countries are rich and have higher vaccination rate then most countries
him if you watch the video then he mentioned infection rates as one of the crucial criteria yet united states and united kingdom good to go but of course you want to make up your own criteria rich rolling on the floor laughing
amir if talk about infectious rate lots of asia counties should be first data will not lie sad to say we need more now then ever
singapore is an as an member should lead by example and secure vaccinated travel lane for as an region first
yew good luck to all of us I am from indonesia and bali is doing the similar no quarantine scheme
from oct of fully vaccinated travellers from canada denmark france italy the netherlands spain the united kingdom and the united states will be able to enter singapore under this arrangement please present the full info do not nit pick
hmm everywhere in the world including singapore those who have been vaccinated are still infected by covid some of them even died especially now the united states is the epicentre of covid I am just questioning the decision that has that is all but go off i guess
us europe infection rate is not better than singapore don't know why they say europe is doing well spore has higher vaccination percentage just that these countries are less concerned with daily infection cases
amir most probably yet to have mutual agreement with other as an countries
objective is to support via revenue first it is just purely business decision money mouth face
precisely and here we a restricting hawkers a topic am disgusting
him need more but spending more on consequences real smart
lucian it is not right to say that because germany with more cases as well and brunei are the first two countries that singapore has vaccinated travel lane arrangement with both have opened up with singapore so it depends on mutual agreement if the other country disagree then vaccinated travel lane may not has happened
a the restriction is to protect vaccinated individuals and reduce the strain on singapore healthcare system
ramadan no quarantine because they are required to take covid per test on are departure and upon arrival also have only been to vaccinated travel lane country regions for the past fourteen days before departure to so
din that's only a theme a you are buying into it easily diff beta cd and cd mindset
nit is up to you want to buy or not but the intention is there or else cases will definitely go even higher and no reduction
i just heard from a youtube that jack a and his wife moved to singapore is jack a from united kingdom or us a money talks and billionaires talk louder
if lee kwan you was still alive and kicking he would have done it differently he even dared to bark at via in united states on harvard campus his party members esp his son are so obvious sucking up to the former anglo saxon colonial masters so is india at the moment

papas policy on vaccinated travel lane is risking the introduction of my variant into singapore it is the beginning of an end peoples action party is going to kill thousands

we are doing very well with low ice occupancy rate the mtg is doing a very good job
acting is not needed when it becomes part of nature macias downloaded new software
should go full removal of restrictions for anyone ages sixty and below only boomers are occupying the hospitals not united states youngsters
just to get it if i a healthy according to the rules of back in the old days like really going far back in history like back to of of i can not enter singapore as a random healthy not vaccinated foreigner that will prevent a lot of business people to come and deal another blow to the tourism industry
it all depends on what restrictions other countries have singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia among others did too it creates a competition for tourist dollars investments etc basically opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others triggering a virtuous cycle it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements then singapore will likely follow too
imperfect perfectionist agree of a with you on that
vaccinated peeps are not welcome be stay out we reject retards
ask cases yesterday and yet today simplify rules for travellers open doors for covid of to come in is stupid repeat the mistake is stupid believing in peoples action party is stupidest
so what ask so what majority are having mild symptoms look at our poor businesses that have suffered from this pandemic if we do not allow the tourists dollars to flow in how will they survive they will end up dying of hunger or worry whereas majority of varied a patients will not die guess who the stupid boy

gourde well said we should expel these clowns out of our society at all cost
no words for stupid people
cases need to rise for lock owns or travel restrictions to lose their effectiveness so its a reason for celebration only a rising case number beyond control can force abandoning restrictions examples plenty european countries australia south korea vietnam etc i said since the beginning the pandemic will last as long as restrictions last

i do not trade i invest with a professional called or edward jones by a cry to company that trades for united states and returns profits on weekly basis for me and you can invest your capital and get weekly returns of investment row without any extra fees attached
I have always wanted to trade cry to but got confused with the fluctuations in price
i had a bad experience investing on malaysia own until i met or edward jones i have made over of a of a trading crypt currency i even made a whooping 28000 on malaysia last trade with a capital of of of retiring next year with no fears

rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
what logic is that opening up more but no easing of restrictions
opening up brings in more tourist dollars what does the easing of restrictions bring in
good thing the more we open up less will be the incentive of closing border as he clearly said when community cases rise closing border losses its effectiveness that is what we need to break out of restrictions and travel bans
thirty nine if too much restrictions tourists will not come either especially if competing tourism and business destinations open up wider without masks etc i am looking at dubai in particular and they have consistently outperformed singapore in every economic and global connectivity metric for last two years they ate singapore status

how can a travel lane be vaccinated it is travel lane for vaccinated visitors
ideally everyone should be socially responsible however in reality human is always flawed when it comes to discipline just like a simple task of wearing a protective mask how many will comply stay home quarantine is even more difficult to comply what has what is stopping a stay home notice person from venturing outside the common corridor to water his or her plant can people stay home for several days without the temptation of going out talk is cheap its the walk that is the challenge
our a is very smart con and corner of to take experimental drugs for big hama and secure investment deals with them both gov and hama co legally not liable to be sue at the same time show the world we are highly tax and now open for business one stone kills two birds
our a is absolute fool the smart one is nothing but a gang of highly educated new world order mafia in collusion with the big harm and biotech such dysfunctional a brings nothing but suffering to the citizens
why would people want to travel for pleasure in the thick of covid pandemic one need to wear mask in public and restricted number in dining in or groups in addition need are event test at some venues moreover delta variant infect both tax and unix does this sound like fun

for almost two years so sad
in the other news no quarantine travel opens
only one tested positive a negative test at the airport on arrival does not mean he will not test positive later while going around spore
its all just a drama clear that one to justify entry
why is pfizer and modern not debuting new vaccine against new variants like delta obviously the current vaccine is not working as it is based on the original covid nineteen virus sin charm is debuting new vaccine against delta
i ask so many questions that leaves me more confused or insulted example i am healthy with a strong i immune system based on the with the vaccine you can still spread the virus why do i need the vaccine if I have just recovered from covid did the test that showed i had enough antibodies but was still strongly suggest to get the vaccine is i am not an anti baxter more would i tell anyone not to get vaccinated
yeah that have bothered getting the vaccine for a of a survival rate virus
tow to four thousand cases per day soon all singaporeans will be covid recovered or victims plus note there are two variants that are not affected by vaccines
which a
are you very happy when the community cases are rising pouting face outing face
nowadays don't come out too many video of news also not transparent
its because there still ample space in hospitals for covid patients
if there a ample space they do not need to resort to stay home recovery
be very careful with travellers from south asia especially dubious indian covid numbers do not be so naive and allow flood of travellers from there
you must be drunk to comment indians are coming low do not even anything just comment anything you like
before the vaccine arrives obviously the purpose is only to help vaccine manufacturers to get data not to save people lives

welcome to singapore welcome to come and live with the virus and sleep with the virus
when open border for bangladesh now bangladesh covered nineteen less
the biggest risk of opening up fully is opening up for new virus variants
de chan your existing post is already very unpleasant so i strongly advise you to refrain from showing an open up do it de
the risk is now highest ever the butterfly effect unmistakably the covid curve is no longer flattened but gone into overdrive and hit above one thousand cases
for those fully vaccinate it is naive and dumb to think you guys are risk free from dying at best it merely lower the risk as total infected number increases the risk increases accordingly
viral load for vaccinated is not reduced mana is a just a lousy crappy flu jab
ice or critical cases is a percentage of total infected regardless of fully vaccinated single vaccinated and vaccinated its still a percentage of total infected in each category death rate will definite increases as total infected shoot up is someone out to destroy singapore
like the new setting and smile grinning face with big eyes
clearly covid nineteen is predominantly spread by fully vaccinated deliberate opening up travel lanes is intended to push the total infected number to a new height putting singaporeans on unnecessary risk that is an irresponsible and selfish act that need to be condemn
mana is the virus else why of vaccinated are the infected
mana was developed for initial covid of not variant a that why vaccines is not working
even the booster shot was for initial covid virus
karma please take care of those who made decision to deprive others lives

it should be obvious we can not eliminate the number of cases for covid of we have to learn to live with covid nineteen just like we live with influenza
the plaque took eight years while spanish flu two years its not impossible to neutralize a pandemic with proper containment everyone must do their part just like how we lien the create his task force to contain the previous plague

carl jay economy and people are closely tied together perhaps you are super rich or happily retired
jay i have no doubt in your strength and resilience but not many people can bear having their business shut down for more than three months or even a with mortgages to pay and inter generational families to feed
the thing is as a business operator and business minded knowledge of global trends from geopolitics to potential pandemics as well as other unforeseeable circumstances that can be expected to happen should have been anticipated expected preempted so that diversifying and switching of industry can be done at a drop of a hat sustaining negligible or recoverable losses i foresee a future of largely online based businesses
jay capitalism adheres to natural selection so economy st and people last so that makes your point do not blame the government for your own failure to switch
is the loss of love ones of other people the world over which governments are to be accountable for coveting economic rescue than their own citizens
jay then you are contradicting yourself because you do know most people are not as as you in fact most governments understands that the economy and the people lives are closely intertwined and they are walking on a tight rope neither are inconsequential although it is perceived that way
humanity in and by itself is contradictory but to become what we all are in order to live together as one species is apparently not written in stone either we all find our senses collectively or perish by our own ways I am talking about a lose lose scenario no prize trophies await neither of us
why urged everyone to reduce social gathering when you want to open up borders for more tourists just let everyone to live their lives as per normal law

with eighty percent of the population vaccinated for covid of attention is now moving towards booster shots in view of the waning protection over time should we use the same or different vaccine just remember what the great scientist albert einstein said

so end of the story singapore despite tax payers paying premium salary to leaders but the outcome is same as every third world country which is cant evade death when infected at least to minimal recent fatality numbers in malaysia opinion shows the management has failed

allow to open borders for a groups of tourists in but singapore only allowed five person gathering and dine in so are the tourists so cap at the group of five too since tourists are allow to come in big groups so when we are able to go out or dine in groups of a
so tourist welfare more important than singaporeans welfare or singaporean citizens can be bullied and pushed around and shoved down our throats so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds all because most will be dead as the new normal shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay we expect more than that everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly

covid has eaten your brain dude
i just don't understand why are all these people up there talking while the specialists experts just typing on keyboards
there are many things in life that one cannot understand if he is a cynic
waste of tax payers resources we don't need spokesmen with no value add we might as well use money employ top scientist
do not know what the true intentions of our government but from all the reports i have seen vaccination does not protect you against covid there are people who ken covid positive even after taking two doses of vaccination the government still think he can fool united states when there are people who died after taking two doses of the vaccination
singapore ministers very easy to do every time has things just tell everyone this is the new normal when singaporeans citizens fatality increases significantly they will continue to tell united states this is the new normal and live with it ignoring precious lifers of singaporean whom trusted them is incorrigible
fed up with them but of still blinded by their little anglo by be
referring to yourself no need to do self criticism
so this is what they mean by hospital all have enough beds all because most will be dead as the new normal shoving into citizens throat and telling death will increase in new normal is not acceptable from the team of highly paid leaders we have because that can be done by leaders from third world country who are paid a fraction of their pay we expect more than that everyone of united states singaporeans have ancestors who toil hard for their next generation and bloodline to enjoy the fruits and not to be reaped off from them selfishly
ninety mind of ministers wanking each other and giving no solutions to tackle covid rather watch a match that has five goals of the same time than this

so i read in the straits time that travellers from macau he china need not serve she upon arrival in so regardless of their vaccination status this means vaccinated citizens from these places are allowed to enter singapore and actually roam around singapore if their per tests are negative so are these vaccinated tourists allowed to dine in at feb or are they excluded from the current regulation how are hong kong and macau special that the citizens need not be vaccinated to enter singapore apart from that they are cars but singapore citizens travelling to these places need to be quarantined

i think you already know the answer but want to seek comfort from some official clarification i think you will not get any
be realistic and accept the reality and fact till the day mask is not needed for vaccinated then singapore is ready to open fully as of now singapore is no where near that stage jumping the gun and expect positive outcome is wishful thinking that is bound to fail
seems only economic recovery is a top concern the st top concern must be to unite all fully vaccinated family members where is the special scheme travel lane of family members nineteen months still not able to or need to wait for magic vaccine fully vaccinated members from any countries must be allowed how many more months they need to wait

from what i understand no or mild symptoms does not mean that the person is fine blood test is needed to tell if there is any inflammatory response in the body once it turns severe it might be too late i wonder what gives the govt the confidence that things will go according to their plan when other countries with high vaccination rate are starting to realise the limitations of the vaccine

useless leaders who took life of singapore citizens children and adults as dirt coming out with their own prognosis of the virus and variant and deciding based on that with no foresight and pushing blame to delta variant when things go wrong like every other third world country leaders
good singapore has so many covid infection with no symptom those tourists will have viral souvenirs for free
their moral compass only points to heavy dollar sign sign
what about foreign students in singapore who would like to see their loved ones and has not seen them in a quite a long time
sweden became the second european union country to ban israeli residents from entry due to a rise in covid of cases in israel despite the country being one of the most vaccinated countries in the world in summary what does it means for countries like israel and singapore to hold the titled of
this only proves that vaccine is not the solution only those countries who are truly sovereign and not a puppet to who can make good and honest decision otherwise it would be nothing but flip flop travelling policies

mall shari only if you are vaccinated in singapore or germany has nothing to do with nationality
it seems to me that our government appears to be relying more on vaccination rates than finding ways to prevent the covid from spreading further i am disappointed crying face crying face crying face
brace for soaring covid cases singapore citizens life are at stake
pap trying to earn money and does not care about united states getting covid of become sick or die earning money out of our misery and on the corpse of covid of death absolutely inhumane

its a gamble lardy increasing everyday what guarantee vaccination is going to protect one hundred percent
international outlook for nut and nus will keep going down the way the international students are treated by the ice
what we will achieve by counting the infected does it add any value from past two years the whole world is following the wrong approach if you are vaccinated then stop counting the infected instead count how many deaths happening change the format to respond to reduce death malaysia opinion i may be wrong
ceca us distinctive to singapore only
they may bring in the new virus cd a
the end is coming
why channel news asia and straits times stop reporting on covid cases now esp the past two days is it to prevent vaccine persistency as now numbers are not looking good for vaccination cases going up etc
cos it vaccines are working of vaccinated but cases a clusters growing on daily basis
sweden became the second european union country to ban israeli residents from entry due to a rise in covid of cases in israel despite the country being one of the most vaccinated countries in the world if channel news asia and straits times continue to report big numbers we may ended up like israel other countries might start to ban singapore citizens from entering their countries
gambling over as outright risky endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure
to hypothesize that something will fail sounds like a theory itself just as baseless
the prof should infect himself with the co it of delta variants or the latest but i think rightfully should be his personal opinion
he may already be infected like the texas governor big mouth until he was hit
heading a dangerous direction
welcome to singapore free delta gift waiting for you rolling on the floor laughing
why is the st so ashamed to report one hundred and ninety one new cases of covid one hundred and eighty seven locally transmitted cases one hundred and thirteen unlinked
no need to report as the information is everywhere on social media feb telegram mon website etc all we need to know is how many are in ice because of being vaccinated or immunity compromised
the vaccinated peoples action party ministers should all infect themselves with co it of delta variants or the latest variant and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory
it will be interesting to find out how many of these vaccinated travellers will bring new variants that are mutating fast to the country however if they infect the people here will the current vaccines available will be able to protect those infected
you will not be surprised if they get infected by united states instead rolling on the floor laughing
neocon virus exchange program literally speaking
let us see when singapore can make a new variant a spread across the globe with travel lanes
sweden became the second european union country to ban israeli residents from entry due to a rise in covid of cases in israel despite the country being one of the most vaccinated countries in the world obviously sweden and portugal voted with action that current vaccines is unable to protect its citizens that why the set new rules

andrews sounds to me like a hopelessly lifeless automaton done count on me face with tears of joy
one after another countries around the world begin to roll back the covid mandates in their countries even israel has to give up its hope in medicines to roll back its covid mandates including the quarantine for tourists except very few countries like those totalitarian societies china no or united states or few others people break down the self isolation to welcome tourists without bothering ask tourists any covid related questions like vaccination or checking temperature
rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy
window of opportunity
so basically nothing has changed
stink pore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may no masks no safe entry check in since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying face and this is called political science nerd face not science rolling on the floor laughing
so if social distancing then don't need mask a
maybe they should start testing peoples spitting whilst talking distance
hopefully other asian countries will follow singapore Singapore they leading the way in asia
hopefully no countries in the world will lead this orwellian is we live thru in the recent years
start fixing your opposition parties then
what a fool indeed pied piper leading the lemmings to the river and get drowned
yeah i can return without quarantine
are not am not you in singapore
what has what is mean vaccinated travel lane face with medical mask hazard
thumbs up thumbs up kudos to the capable spore govt
kudos to the govt soon there will be no mask mandate for tourist visitors despite increasing covid cases and deaths the govt decides to ease covid measures instead of mitigating the covid situation its clear that the govt does not want to lose out on global travel rebounds so increase fatality is acceptable collateral damage
its follow the leader low
of is non mandatory safe distancing
most vaccinated travel lane are people who want to return to their homeland like malaysian
three thousand people in an event at this time to me that bad news in terms of the virus spread but people who are vaccinated are in much better shape news are in pretty good supply now in certain countries and that helps greatly too
hi i am from bangladesh i can meet a please send your facebook I had I would
steven just do not come back to infect your fellow men
steven please do a vaccinated travel lane video from melbourne to koala bumper pretty please thank you so much
can is singapore channel
you should have done the vaccinated travel lane travel process to south korea anyway i cannot find any such video on youtube yet
how is travelling on a vaccinated travel lane different than normal what are the pros and cons of travelling via vol
its interesting how both the art and per are significantly more expensive in singapore than in germany any possibility to dig into explaining what goes into the difference in test costs for singapore is germany
greedy people want to make money
seriously if you travel on holiday during a pandemic you really need to have your head examined
please stop all this
selling via or promoting it now bios it heavily indebted but not our live into it and be fool by it sorry be honest with it worth it what if cannot and will not be able to fly back and got stuck in the air that is the end of it too late by than
first of all thank you steven and channel news asia for doing the german vaccinated travel lane video its so informative and i used it as malaysia reference prior to travelling to germany and belgium recently yes please do a travel series i am planning to visit korea next hope to see steven on the same flight
anyone from australia for any purpose can come to singapore but not the other way round why singapore low class so hard up meh unequal agreement also accept not just australia so many countries can ska ska come to singapore but not vice versa
with all the hassles uncertainties of tests and additional costs it rather travel within malaysia own country in malaysia and still enjoy the nature sun and beaches
every time he comes on screen I shall I will switch channel
me too
he should watch bayern game instead of ice hockey
main issue is unpredictability for working adults who have to book leave with their employers if you require quarantine prior to return flight to singapore you tested positive before your flight back not many employers will be too pleased with your absence since you would not be arriving back in singapore as planned regardless of whether you had any control over situation
is it true that only flying so can get quarantine free
nope that not true vaccinated travel lane flights are available on other airlines too it depends on the country
china thumbs upright skin tone clapping hands light skin tone confusing info from everyone thanks for clarification
what happens if you are vaccinated are we still allowed to book tickets on singapore airlines
seventy seven yes you can but you may have to serve quarantine in the country you visit only those on vaccinated travel lane flights do not have to serve quarantine but they must be vaccinated
on so and lufthansa are the only two airlines offering vaccinated travel lane flights from germany
china hey steven do a vaccinated travel lane report on says inaugural nonstop flight to vancouver law
if vaccinated travel lane is a bad idea your trip says it all
go to south korea plus would like to know how to process is there for vol
the days of budget travel are officially over enough said
this does not affect the vaccinated travel lane as the lane is for arrivals into singapore only as for entry to germany as of oct of fully vaccinated travellers from singapore can still enter germany without serving quarantine though there are restrictions for young children read more here
insider great clarification and next hope channel news asia can do another documentary on vaccinated travel lane to other asian countries like india pakistan brunei taiwan hong kong or china and show more footage on how steve explore several tourist attractions and find opportunity to locate and interview singaporeans who was visiting these countries at that time
what about vaccinated passengers are we still allowed to board singapore airlines what are the ramifications for the untaxed
seventy seven am unsure if vaccinated can travel to bin
why is the art in germany only cost one to a a euros singapore cost ard ten sing dollars why why why government plus do something about this i do not need you to give me free i need you to bring the cost down so i can buy myself
cos they produce locally i checked with malaysia friend in us costs around so of per kit in united states too
yes its definitely worth aside from small hassle such as per testing or a a days testing at your own expenses please do south korea for vol because we are in the midst of finalizing the plans to travel in jan feb two thousand and twenty two
a a sorry afraid you'll have to do your own research grinning squinting face
and australia please steve
if you get used to the art and per tests most likely you of a
so should keep their house clean first can you imagine inviting your friends to your messy and dirty house that is so embarrassing i am sure others will not clean up too
where a you get these bags from these purses are perfect need one asap and the bag
he needs to be updated a a a
still seems like somewhat of a hassle and so many variables
indeed its just too mind boggling and depressing and in fact humiliating to go through all these health screening regimes so no thanks for vaccinated travel lane for leisure ever
feet so its not mandatory to get vaccinated to fly on singapore
seventy seven no vaccination no fly just like no money no talk beaming face with smiling eyes
covid vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak
thank you this was very informative
and per is really not necessary for vaccinated folks art will do actually
only foolish vaccinated folks in some countries are wearing masks outdoors not the other way around
are you immune like the rest of the politicians
covid is a scam deal with with
you lost it more infected a more deaths
no income without tourists
no uninfected peasants allowed in
grab singapore stopped all fostered routine art testing we still strongly encourage delivery partners to stay vigilant do regular self testing and visit doctor when feeling unwell
max anglo boss very happy no more art thought he won hope he contract covid a up lorry soon
systems are looking nonsensical as this pandemic prolonged
ever since the start of the global vaccine roll out in january of of some experts have been crying out against mass and rapid vaccination of populations in the midst of a raging pandemic if they are right this will go on creating more variants and prolonging the pandemic so far it is looking like it and god help us thank you channel news asia for this report and with this song of hope i pray for gods swift intervention to end this pandemic
you ministers messed up big time numerous restrictions on malaysians where risk level is low to medium but you opened the floodgates for the indians to come in and now of of a cases daily
the more cases life and travel will go back to normal sooner or else singapore will end up like hong kong lee sign long is no curry lamb
imperfect perfectionist can you compensate the suffering and death of singaporeans
singh no i am not responsible to compensate for random peoples lives a modicum of reality should tell that to anyone
dear ministers your decisions and policies have failed and caused so much grief to singaporeans never listened to me

whatever anyway viruses have everywhere since we are born to this world just because of politics and business make it life more difficult just take care of our families good and safe our lives by our own way should be of
this govt simply wants everyone of united states to get covid its disrupting our work and health for goodness
can we tolerate these rubbish anymore
how come i see comments comparing hong kong worse off than sep but never mention how many died due to covid beta them sep won by over of a which leadership protects its people
sincerely yours

what happens when different countries have different definitions of fully vaccinated you end of the day still vaccinated travel lane but only in another shape and form
easy different definitions of for foreigners and singaporeans we have to take booster foreigners no need

precisely indonesia faster to recognise novara and now sep follows us europe a israel already he similar test results recognising natural immunity almost as effective as fully vaccinated but still no reporting here natural immunity has been discovered still active for cars since then unlike annual vaccination needed now

just to get it if i a healthy according to the rules of back in the old days like really going far back in history like back to of of i can not enter singapore as a random healthy not vaccinated foreigner that will prevent a lot of business people to come and deal another blow to the tourism industry
it all depends on what restrictions other countries have singapore relaxed because vietnam and australia among others did too it creates a competition for tourist dollars investments etc basically opening up or marginal relaxing creates pressure on others triggering a virtuous cycle it becomes more difficult for others to continue with restrictions if more countries eliminate vaccination requirements then singapore will likely follow too
imperfect perfectionist agree of a with you on that
vaccinated peeps are not welcome be stay out we reject retards
ask cases yesterday and yet today simplify rules for travellers open doors for covid of to come in is stupid repeat the mistake is stupid believing in peoples action party is stupidest
so what ask so what majority are having mild symptoms look at our poor businesses that have suffered from this pandemic if we do not allow the tourists dollars to flow in how will they survive they will end up dying of hunger or worry whereas majority of varied a patients will not die guess who the stupid boy
petrous you are very selfish just because you are afraid of this and that you decide that the right thing to do is to sacrifice others livelihoods that is blatantly wrong
you can hide in your flat for the rest of your life if you are so afraid
gourde well said we should expel these clowns out of our society at all cost
no words for stupid people
cases need to rise for lock owns or travel restrictions to lose their effectiveness so its a reason for celebration only a rising case number beyond control can force abandoning restrictions examples plenty european countries australia south korea vietnam etc i said since the beginning the pandemic will last as long as restrictions last

i agree with you and i believe that the secret to financial stability is having the right investment ideas to enable you earn more money i do not know who agrees with me but either way i recommend either real estate or cry to and stocks

i do not trade i invest with a professional called or edward jones by a cry to company that trades for united states and returns profits on weekly basis for me and you can invest your capital and get weekly returns of investment row without any extra fees attached
I have always wanted to trade cry to but got confused with the fluctuations in price
i had a bad experience investing on malaysia own until i met or edward jones i have made over of a of a trading crypt currency i even made a whooping 28000 on malaysia last trade with a capital of of of retiring next year with no fears
i think trading is easier with proper guidance especially from a professional it really helps reduce the chances of running into losses all thanks to or edward jones he changed malaysia life i was able to pay off malaysia mortgage

rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
what logic is that opening up more but no easing of restrictions
opening up brings in more tourist dollars what does the easing of restrictions bring in
good thing the more we open up less will be the incentive of closing border as he clearly said when community cases rise closing border losses its effectiveness that is what we need to break out of restrictions and travel bans
thirty nine if too much restrictions tourists will not come either especially if competing tourism and business destinations open up wider without masks etc i am looking at dubai in particular and they have consistently outperformed singapore in every economic and global connectivity metric for last two years they ate singapore status
imperfect perfectionist mind sharing the measures in dubai sounds like they are doing well

how about opening the causeway soonest possible for those who cannot afford to fly sir thanks
yes please open up asap so that the families on both sides can finally visit each other after so long those who aim for vacation or shopping please wait
for opening of granting free land vaccinated travel lane to malaysia i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
besides malaysians that stay in johore bar and come to work in singapore daily there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johore bar that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johore bar daily please allow land vaccinated travel lane granting free travel both ways for this group too especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or up to four pass if they are immediate family members all vaccinated also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johore bar should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane granting free land travel soonest possible this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they could not return to their johore bar homes

thank you channel news asia for this report on singapore swift intervention to demolish this pandemic
does anybody know if any nationalities can use this vaccinated travel lane to enter malaysia
fully vaccinated right so the cases should not rise right a
once fully vaccinated just open all borders without any restrictions like per tests etc after all its stated that once fully vaccinated at most will be impacted but no ice and nothing serious then what has what is the issue here life is simple keep life simple
hello along i do not mind paying malaysia own covid nineteen medical fees
good work ministers please give yourselves bonus folded hands
i think twenty four months bonus will be fair
for sure travelling will be not the same once virus if disappears only will get the fun of travelling vaccinated travelling is a risk
all about extracting money so the people dwindles their savings and become dependent upon the government further or just out themselves this is no tactic
so if we use vaccinated travel lane travel to koala bumper can we go out from koala bumper and travel to other town
town council
yes its time to open travel lanes between united states and malaysia to cross breed our covid efforts and generate new strains
thought he is smart grinning face with sweat
singapore must not open vaccinated travel lane at woodlands check point malaysian government and it peoples had a bad habit of switch off the tap water etc so what singapore needs to do now just wait for another six months high risk
what does switching off tap water supply have to do with opening borders
singapore is heading for big trouble we must stop free quarantine travel with malaysia for another six months high risk
great job by the govt of so more countries will definitely come on board soon

its very bad news for johore bar business community
good cant wait to fly out of this covid infested failed nation and discriminating bullies
its weird infection rates are still thousands but they are talking about open borders for travelling just because majority are vaccinated they talk as if the vaccines are working person shrugging male sign
they need new reasons for people to take the booster vaccines low pfizer will be a trillion ire company
its all about their money our lives are nothing for them
this is the kind of world was the best time to invest for the future
investing in today is priceless because tomorrow is not promised trading bit coin gold silver and cry to secure a better tomorrow
charles interesting most people do not understand the market moves and tends to be mislead in facts like this and always depend on money in the bank very bad idea

no good no good must luck own
I am really happy for this epidemic we can truly see which countries government is really useless and a laughing stock to others
why there are still cases in spore yet you allowed outsiders to enter spore this is not preventions it spreading the virus into spore then who suffer after late milky gone spore law rules regulations getting worsen doesn't make sense can the new government be smart like late milky

vaccine tyranny will only lead to more setbacks bullying the three thousand experimented public servants forcing them to tax mandatory vaccine is here taxed rated is already of singapore is already on decline track there is no opposition here no freedom discrimination will be at full force so that you cannot see most death now are the

you can also expect delta to enter singapore thanks pap do not vote pap

another troll spotted please just go support your opposition clown and bring singapore to even more bottom
even people do not vote for pap they still win
delta is already here of you talking about
long agree with you that why get of singapore gone case already
what you can expect at low cases to go up
comparing taiwan and singapore you will see a direct opposite in handling covid of since beginning of two thousand and twenty till now taiwan was well controlled from starts its economy hardly impact by covid of whereas singapore has never really had a break from covid nineteen since first case on card jan two thousand and twenty till now economy is badly hit and still on going taiwan won lots of praises a recognition internationally whereas nobody mentioned singapore if they do its mostly mockery ridicule or negative singapore years of good reputation and good name is ruined in the hands of incompetents over two years
what to do taiwan heeds the real experts in handling the virus whereas we only have experts taking united states for a ride in asia i can safely say taiwan has one of the best healthcare system and doctors around based on a personal experience here and there was played around by many local doctors in singapore and am utterly disappointed
lee taiwan face the problem squarely no bidding no avoidance no dumb measures no incompetent leaders no fake experts
does taiwan practise discrimination against the vaccinated
mad no it the closest to true democratic system in asia
lee yup taiwan health care thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up singapore health care was very good thirty to forty years ago deterioration started after till today and on going
do not agree you go move to taiwan more suitable for you
lee actually we do have accredited experts just that they may be opposition and peoples action party do not actually believe in putting the right people for the job
cut the singaporean government are idiots all this money and spending but they do not know how to handle

things that need to control its either lax or not properly controlled things that do not need to control they apply maximum control what kind of result do they expect to get that singapore government
i guess they forgot to control people like you who are all out to damage our reputation
yup they release doggies to bark painlessly to create fake support lots of them that singapore government
chan how much are you paid to destroy spore
comments do not destroy anything only incompetent in power will destroy a country barking to create fake support is meaningless
your good friend already spoilt the reputation by engaging in bribery in brazil ports
chan you are the one who sprout nonsense i am afraid
chan i think with supporters like you then will destroy the country
him well said he is out to destroy spore useless citizen
released a out to destroy singapore true feedback are delayed or hindered true traitors indeed

narrow minded troll vincent and kong spotted no wonder singapore no future just lock down singapore border forever
in the other news attorneys general in eleven us states filed suit friday against president joe biden vaccines mandate
him these losers repeat themselves as if some change might happen just because they turned into parrots
who left the stray do a pound gate open
what case all way and next year january singapore open house already free flow of the pandemic of the vaccinated
de then what lock down better for you all
chop i think they are loser for a reason

in the end virus keep spreading
totally agree with you
seems kind of pointless
this comment is pointless grinning squinting face
do not expect too much from fake news can
for opening of granting free land vol i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
since we have family there and unable to see them for one year now please let united states know when singapore will open up to india sri lanka ext text
i would like to know when singapore will open a vaccinated travel for sri lanka india etc would it be soon
how russian citizens smashed the silly moscow vaccination passports in just three weeks this is how you do it clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands plus share
the travel bubble with hong kong is always a hiccup doubts about this move perhaps the top should lead the way to show that it is safe enough and not jeopardize what safety level that is already achieved till now
with the eth wave going through germany Germany please do this with great careful consideration and caution
i find the reasoning of allowing germany to singapore rather puzzling germany is part of the she gen area and as such everyone from countries like netherlands belgium sweden greece france or spain can travel into germany and then fly to singapore as well yes there is an official requirement of a negative per test or proof of full vaccination in order to enter germany but the control is often lax or should you rather show proof of residence in germany if you want to book a flight to singapore
must be vaccinated in germany or in singapore
waiting for vaccinated travel lanes with south asian countries
somerset of all tourist coming
power la orchard road malls got business liao lend lease heat liao
it seems a way more complicated better not to travel international travel seems to have a perpetual ban unless its extremely dire situation its not worth the risk another perspective
where is the covid isolate the cd is do not have it so where is the virus the nation is watching you
do not need to keep on making screens look stupid like everyday got foreigners entering singapore a after some time found to be infected then later blame screens a forcing to vaccinate singapore cannot guarantee anything bios our country will soon get bankrupt
this guy looks unfamiliar and foreign to me i dun know why but he gave me the kind of uncaring and sinister impression at first glance
your impression is correct but he has he is a local mama face vomiting dog safety vest pile of poo
best good news shooting star thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thanks all cheerio shooting star thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
is not this kind of risky
if you open up to germany are you not indirectly opening up to the europe as a whole due to the relative freedom of movement within the union seems risky tbs
i got mixed feelings about this
no new rule introduced vaccinated mask only vaccinated people the mask can fits face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
we should open our borders to other countries that have a similar vaccination rate and vaccination effort as well as is the no of cases they experience at time of consideration we really cannot risk covid further mutating into harder to contain strains
local law first live with covid see this goods can manage or not beaming face with smiling eyes
please open all lifts door old in singapore when not in use to ventilate it and not close the door and keep the germ collision and far fire inside
how about toilet door

how about indonesia and malaysia we have family there
malaysia cannot the cases are soaring high
do not even dream about it bro face with medical mask beaming face with smiling eyes
said germany also soaring high
from past experience this will not work and will be cancelled as well do not the peoples action party ever learn
if they ever learn then they will not be peoples action party right thinking face
great vaccinated people are super carriers loads of virus and asymptomatic the facts are showing virus being dormant due to vaccines effect undetectable when host immune system is hit by common ailments the activities somehow would trigger covid into action vaccinated may be the silent killers to doomsday
people with proposal will get hit by covid soon
any advise on trace together app
wow great news thumbs up medium light skin tone lug from phil
when is singapore opening to india they getting very inpatient they love you most
gov so dumb one must be too old

the world says we are doing well comfort and good lives breed foolishness
if really kenya the omega us variant simply blame it on the vaccinated again play the push blame game till two thousand and twenty four then say again
face you re nothing more than a one hit wonder thinking face face with tears of joy

the to guys are excited right now since singapore to are closed hah shah
singapore does not have a self sustaining economy because of it well being not
they are so desperate to open that they are willing to bend down and open their rear ends wide as well come one come all any offers will do partying face clown face circus tent exploding head clown face

interesting how silica know if any europe passport has been in germany a days before depart to so mtg mil match
a you the passport will show the date they enter germany what when is the last time you travel
i ram so you never been to eur which kampong you pm learn dude when you travel within eur there is no immigration stamp within europe countries
that is why one needs to declare that one has not been outside germany a has been inside the last twenty one days same thing when you declare about your health status when you enter so of course no one knows but if you get caught for not declaring the truth you get the consequence grimacing face
singapore a need immigration police if every is honest truthful sharing kind stop dreaming especially in pandemic character change dude since there is loop hole in immigration control singapore govt should announce
residence i agree with you like i said this is everyone a responsibility if everyone is honest then the world would be peaceful but its otherwise right so i guess singapore gov wants to try slowly law i am living in germany the politics here itself is somehow not logic but just for your info here also there is also control if one comes into germany from other higher risk europe countries
singapore atari a do not worried law they are too dumb to catch anyone one mama from india worked in singapore as a senior management staff with fake credentials for more than ten years that was why our famous small space it is no longer manpower mini tress
yang chi europe has twenty seven countries germany is the gateway to so when they cross border each other no checking singapore should announce she gen enter singapore quarantine free
of let us bring it on
what about india
report say that all countries had been vaccinated
travellers from all other countries regions except bangladesh india myanmar nepal pakistan and sri lanka where entry is currently not allowed will be required to undergo a of day stay home notice she at dedicated she facilities travellers will also be required to comply with the testing regime as indicated in annex
no go away if they want to be included they better do not be a idiotic sovereign
gamer they are rich and got high spending power to boost our economy so they deserve it
feet no the rich ones today are from india and china
us a have you seen the recent new clips of county and town hall fights over mandatory wearing of masks
wong stooped fight everywhere
self isolation after per test where in singapore upon arrival how long where can one apply for the vat and from when thank you
what the difference between a vaccinated person from malaysia and germany thinking face
what are the vaccination rates in germany and malaysia what are the daily positive cases in these two countries
kong what about china china has one hundred and eleven covid cases today compared to nine thousand and eight german cases where is the logic thinking face
and agree hundred points
they are white
and you do know that there is no quarantine from china if you travel from china to singapore now there is zero quarantine required so travellers from china already have an advantage over anyone else
kong we have enough of malaysian they are all opportunist they can turn their back to singapore fast and swift
and untrue currently people from china can enter singapore and just do a swab test overnight observation then if they re clear no need she for exchange students
and i agree with you there is no logic about a lot of things in this world today even when china is the one that causes all these viruses so still let them in right do you of a believe what china declare about their infections rate
problem is vaccination with sin vac in malaysia this soup is not working well
nguyen anyone with covid and lots of are cordially welcomed beaming face with smiling eyes while those who have no covid but no are not welcomed pouting face loudly crying face
are you really sure if yes lets personally complain to the circus master la a pig nose
second hero thank you can we count on you to testify to this
singapore nobody in the world globe showing Europe Africa believes china a peoples action party dog safety vest pile of poo hammer
face with tears of joy beaming face with smiling eyes face with tears of joy
yang chi but still i do no why we still suck up to china do not say singapore law germany also the same person shrugging light skin tone male sign
yang chi just go google it china and singapore as of writing really no need fourteen day quarantine unless sick
yang chi yes i know of someone who came to singapore from china last week
germany nine thousand cases today or
nine thousand maybe its vaccinated pal the travel lane still need to be fully vaccinated than take test before departing germany on arrival another test then ord day one more test and seven day one more test so a lot of in place
yes we have infections that a fact but you also have to see what is the per of of population for the infections for example singapore is a a of a zero population germany of a of a of a malaysia of a of a zero
hong ling a lash too many checks law one here in germany and then have to prepaid for per tests in so face screaming in fear loudly crying face
singapore infection is one thing hospitalized is another so far from us example even though the cases are up the deaths and ice and serious cases are not that high so hopefully it means most of those have no symptoms or just mild flu and stay indoors we got to try opening up a bit even if its just two countries unless we want to remain shut till of of by sept a vaccination rate in singapore should be over of maybe of which makes a vaccinated
hong ling i agree with a singapore has to open up slowly of course there will be trial a error in the beginning int it the direction that we all should get vaccinated although even when one get vaccinated one can still get the virus but at least when one is vaccinated and also follow protocol the chances are much lower than those who did not want not vaccinated
singapore i think its unusual for a country to take stages to open up since so far we have only seen countries like united kingdom who opt to go or have restrictions in place for singapore to try and pick a middle route and how to manage it its harder and no one knows how it will turn out so a lot of sceptical and negative comments hopefully it will be fine
hong ling well we have start somewhere but at least a decision is made be it good or bad we do not know let us hope fir the best i remember when singapore closed since eighteen mar last year a then people in singapore are going restless a said they should open now that singapore is slowly open the people are afraid that sad
singapore yeah i watched the movie on go on ord april of of on the same day they announce the circuit breaker start on six apr have not been to the cinema since
singapore as minister on say there is three groups of pal one will say why dun open up more scared for what the other will say what are you crazy shut the borders and dun let anyone in the ord group just try to find a middle ground so whatever we decide either the st group or the and group will come in to criticize
hong ling that is very sad is not it malaysia family is living in singapore a here i am in germany a have not seen malaysia family since of of and i also feel sorry for people who have families just across the causeway a not able to be with them for more than five hundred days its so near a yet so far away crying face
hong ling air yeah you know law peoples mouth these people always have something bad coming out from their mouth instead of listening and evaluating and discuss they started to criticism with having the knowledge
ism worried of the children who are not eligible for vac
ismail when it comes to children i myself not sure its good or not
with the emergence of omicron are we going to close our vaccinated travel lane with countries with higher risks and higher inter activities with a and it neighbouring countries
kos strict control on internal resident but open gates for the highest risk countries a if you open gates to all then is time to lift up restriction on singapore resident at least bet families members and closed one for house visit a dinning the virus not only looking for singaporean apr and these foreigners are main carriers too
org exactly what i needed
stupid idea to open borders for india their cases are still so high what is singapore government doing put knife on our medical team and singaporean again pouting face
effectiveness of vaccines by cd
this is madness how can vaccinated travel lane be given to india haven't singapore suffered enough from the india delta variant why welcome the delta variant plus from india
cut uncle mode called up your pm who obliged like a puppy
why india is included when its infection rate is one of the highest
it mention that those twenty one countries are most contributors to daily arrivals in singapore before pandemic if or country is not considered as significant contributor be patient to wait for next vaccinated travel lane or pay for she at hotels
there are naive dumb apple that are overjoyed by lower daily cases is it really so unlikely
expect covid cases to get worst
yes singapore is land of virus
the delta variant has done enough damage time to open more vols its time to welcome the delta plus variant

so the rich and fifty and the fifty rich can take a flight to koala bumper then take another flight to sinai then take a taxi to job while the not so rich and the poor has to wait patiently for the causeway to open this is a clear discrimination between the rich and the poor i do not understand what they are thinking
i hope there will be some measures to prevent are covid nightmare crossing the customs
hello asians why so like that both he like that so is all about a spend so much on buying aeroplane a how can allow land vaccinated travel lane now its like opening the floodgates of hell break loose
besides malaysians that stay in johore bar and come to work in singapore daily there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johore bar that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johore bar daily please allow land vaccinated travel lane granting free travel both ways for this group too especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or up to four pass if they are immediate family members all vaccinated also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johore bar should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane granting free land travel soonest possible this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they could not return to their johore bar homes
i pity those who went back and thought they can have a three months break and come back to singapore after the circuit breaks most of them thought they are entitled to their old jobs or they could flogged to another company like before unfortunately many did not get to return either the company fold up or the boss taking this opportunity to dismiss the unproductive of course there are many hardworking who got to return with all expenses paid
malaysian only work in retail or food industry many had gone bust
singapore is a modern day slavery nation does not allow malaysians to go back home
singapore is a modern day slavery nation does not allow malaysians to go back home
looking at some of comments many people do not understand about vaccine and travel lanes secondly knowingly that a country with high population density has daily infected running in the thousands and vaccinated can still be infected why would you take such a risk if you have that option travelling is optional but covid infections is not
please activate the ferry from singapore to johore last time there was a service from merging to harbour front and was cancelled please activate this mode of travel
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything
malaysia desperate for sing dollars squinting face with tongue face with tears of joy
without our water you cannot drink hello kitty
singapore is heading for big trouble stop stop and must stop vaccinated travel lane with malaysia their government and its citizens always say turn of tap no water for singapore why not wait for another six to twelve months malaysia is a high risk covid of country
we are more worried about our closest neighbouring states like malaysia whom we are more connected generally in fact we are practically families and yet we welcome almost daily from india china and all those europeans countries and especially the united states the nos one holder champion for deaths and infections since day one and still rising of these deadly covid virus whf
malaysian choose to come here nobody owns you anything
i thought you are from malaysia
singapore small country what do you expect
invest in singapore with no land no man power and no resources risking your investment in singapore cities of neighbouring countries are fast developing and better than singapore
since you pal have such thinking you should go back to your own country to enjoy singapore is a sinking country let our own singaporean sink with our own country
vindicate you in the base of our rich country
really rich if you wanna be rich be like kuwait dubai and doha citizens are priority every thing is free there for citizens
did be grateful is malaysia advice
you said singapore is rich but not comparable with kuwait doha and dubai you have said singapore is richer than japan and japan working as nanny in singapore hama funny just the pop little populations singapore need foreign workers in order to earn more money when migrant leave singapore good luck look your status at gap world ranking shrinking to the deepest core
did our tar is at one one percent simple theory
you discriminate foreign workers as maids or others but you use them for country growths i hope foreign workers would left you behind
did be appreciative and grateful
country but arrogant do not worry china will claim your country and your people back to mainland china
wow a dilute indonesia philippines vietnam are growing fast while singapore no space for growing spend more wealth in floating cities but also your your floating cities no more because china block singapore in rivers side for expansion
did we need to add talents to our country to be relevant and competitive forgive me for being frank and we cannot depend on the likes of pests in our society too many will sink this country
future development is not dependent on how you snatch the young aspirants to works in singapore since neighbouring countries has resources and manpower for development singapore is getting old continuing the weakening of the singapore economy and yet no resources no man power and no land for expansion
did thanks for your sudden enlightenment we need ten million population you are finally right
did then a you still here go home law in miss boy
is but singapore is so much smaller to begin with this is a step in the right direction rather than the immediate opening of a land vaccinated travel lane that could result in a usual daily traffic volume of ask via the causeways
what pain it is their gov to solve they do not contribute to our economy
johore should cooperate with spore to build island for developed a called singapore johore land
a stop pfizer vaccination a open borders with indonesia and malaysia a stop buying fighter jets instead provide financial support to singaporeans freedom and way out of pandemic
you wan go home muss pay ticket one hundred and fifty good plan government get rich people super slavery
a yamaha do not let malaysian foreign worker go ever home this is what i say modern day slavery
this kind of is stupid
a consider as news to me its just propaganda
for me it accept
more keen on land vaccinated travel lane can wait since working in is much more useful
no need to be jealous why do not you take over their jobs
give one inch don't ask for a foot wait and see if cases go up with this vaccinated travel lane how
no need to open malaysia where is malaysia
malaysia is our hinterland
a ii pundit is a country called tai main cantonese
if there is vaccinated travel lane by land even if its not the are covid daily of of of people crossing then singapore will be seeing one hundred to three hundred death min a day because of the population density and distribution johore bar will also see a spike in cases and crimes
totally agrees with you thumbs up
they will overwhelmed our hospital
i think its okay as we are interlinked we need their workers as our locals are either useless or too choosy
all i can comment is malaysia boles very useful as malaysia office cleaners are if not i think the virus could easily spread faster a rms of Malaysia hundred point thumbs up
nelson does not matter they are not scared so why are we so scared
i guess the pay back home is more scary face screaming interface screaming interface screaming in fear
malaysians are not am not keen at all we are opening borders with countries that are mismanaging covid this is dangerous our government is crazy
singapore removed from europe travel list may affect vols on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country the europe said they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid of as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources ref asian new failed internationally
so perfect one hundred on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
simply put singapore is not interested to establish full vaccinated travel lane with malaysia so malaysians folks will have to rely only on the air route singapore is only interested in attracting affluent travellers from overseas to spend within the country cheap johore bar shopping trip is a gone era
why you think immediately after get of a hong increased petrol tax cos you all imprisoned on little red dot face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth
it is only johore ans that want sporrans back i just wonder whether the rest of malaysians care
singapore sing a i kan dang rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
a are absolutely talking full of rubbish you must be those at as elite bastards who only go shopping at at as place
the world population is imprisoned in an open air jail
land vols with johore bar am not are not gonna happen cos of money bag money bag drain out cheap petrol shopping massage loss of get
a good option is to restrict day tripper should be five days or one week minimum stay
i miss going to malaysia for a holiday hope that the pandemic will subside somehow folded hands
go and never cone back without been fined go stupid the malaysian custom need revenue
me too whf
ism afraid daily commuting between countries for work by land will be a thing of the past in post covid era hope i am wrong
you are right singapore has change the laws with mon no more workers from malaysia with motorcycles will be think of the past you are no wrong no more sugar zigzag in singapore
its impossible to execute vaccinated travel lane on land than on air as follow on the causeway or teas the crowd easily exceed the numbers of people exiting the art station during peak hours
so you mean only the rich can travel a ticket might be affordable for you but not for the masses
there is a train from singapore to johore they can setup a system where a limited number of people are allowed to move to and fro
bros where do you store the per kit to test travellers and trained personal each per test takes fifteen to thirty minutes the a will be terrible
a what a joke tell me how to control and make sure document is real for a thousand daily
four hundred and seventy seven it is not about the a it is about how to make sure and control in malaysia you can easily ask someone make a fake document by giving some money their corruption is
eighty six then why vaccinated people still need to do test what has what is the point of vaccinated travel lane and getting the vaccine
a because you can still get it after the jab the jab is to reduce the chance of you dying
the malaysians choose to work and stay here rather than their own country and home nobody owns them its their own choice
eighty six but there are vaccinated people dying from covid
there are so many ways do not need million dollar salary to figure it out just activate ferry booking system there is also the woodlands waterfront taft harbour front that can be used as ferry terminal everybody will are book the tickets so no overcrowding for buses and trains just add more frequency and allow are booking or control the bus example fifty persons per bus and assign the buses based on bus licence plate number if they can do app for trace together bus app can also be done same for train there already is a system for booking there will not be any over crowding i took the train so many time already it is very good
terry singapore gov just want the daily cheap workers from malaysia take ferry those worker find not worth to come in
both governments are trying to find ways to help change airport and ilia to milk some money out of those so eager to travel
bingo also opening of johore bar causeway drains money bag money bag
causeway opening will still be a long way to go
of course they need to squeegee last cent from poor people to enslave population properly
studio we should open the causeway as soon as possible
provided malaysia and indonesia agree to let united states do to record high numbers of cases in the world is here in singapore
studio indonesia should be keen too
i hope so that will be very generous from them i guaranty you singapore gov will never accept those terms if we was in opposite situation
vol air is again for the rich
hi smart guy can teach united states a fool proof way to make sure twenty thousand people are negative and vaccinated proof is real by the way is daily not happy spend a bit on the air ticket and go home
one more thing why never compliant about thailand land border still closed
so malaysians are poor need land to cross over just like seven month hell gate open for money hungry
air ticket also cheap la not rich also can pay law
if you asked a malaysians of course they are greedy to now ask for land vaccinated travel lane and making excuse they are costly other few have no qualm of flying back to meet their families cost is not a concern when families matter given them an inch and they greedily take a mile
i agree with you
actually only johore ans care about the land vol i live in koala bumper and the cost for flight and driving almost same
that typical malaysian wat first day you know them
locals on both sides not too keen on this its gonna create a large scale pandemic for so peoples action party might gonna aim for ask daily cases maybe then will push singapore to extinction
chop low who likes their own comment
fear is a strange thing they keep ranting as if the virus will go away weak people
what has what is the diff between thousands of infections daily is pandemic
zero cases is an impossibility you still think trying to hide from an omnipresent virus would work
black has any peoples action party elite been infected and gained natural immunity
so perfect one hundred on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
influenza cases in singapore is a lot higher than covid cases but nobody cares and live normal why not use the same terms for that as a malaysian i do not understand what singaporeans really want you blame the gov if they close the border but now planning to open up and you still blame them learn to move on like western countries did because our vaccination rates still higher than them
wolf influenza does not affect the lungs the way to and covid do many covid cases shown lungs damaged i not sure if every case but many cases your ignorance gives you the feel good bliss you got pass of level or not by the way your bliss is based on yet to be proven no long term side effects from mana your habit of making feel good assumptions is amazingly amazing
wolf as a singaporean i do not understand what malaysian really want why come singapore to work when malaysia have work you blame the government but still come here we singaporeans knows our government can do a better job and you malaysians know your government can do a better job
malaysian come here for what whatever its or own choice nobody owns you anything
yeah singapore is a small tiny island no natural resources like malaysia thinking face
asians more interested in jobs in singapore singaporeans more interested in shopping in asia
think closely
asian also want singapore to go shopping in asia
i had a good grinning face with smiling eye grinning face with smiling eye grinning face with smiling eyes
go a face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
doris think of security loudly crying face
with this pandemic shopping is by a touch on or mobile phone no need to leave ones house
jan actually he means about holiday too
of course this is easily clearly explained last but not least the malaysian can retire at fifty five back home the great work till sixty five may not still be able to retire or afford his medical bills

a why do not you be one
a pm supply and demand mainland is will sink singapore vitamin strength is a a
malaysia only interest is money if singapore has money it is about the price of how much money does singapore have into order to have vaccinated travel lane with malaysia
we one sing a of right
no want no want land one custom sure one sure flood one side control
wait long arch after this air vaccinated travel lane they sleep
turning terminal two into a covid hospital for travellers will surely bring in more cash for can
even the europeans are horrified that all we do now is depends on vaccination and nothing else in england scotland and wales very strict with vaccine passport and masks mandatory
there of deaths for whole united kingdom from october eleven to of last week
of infection mostly age twelve to fifteen as vaccination rate very low
us has 45000 new covid cases and fifty seven covid deaths today spore should not vaccinated travel lane with us
us has 55000 new covid cases today and fifty seven covid deaths how can spore has vaccinated travel lane with us
the no of dislikes says it all
yes seek for medical advice malaysia friends doctors does not know wat to doing
the figure was by 8oct2021 by oct covid deaths in spore is two hundred and twenty four overtaking has
comparison hong kong is scoreless deaths in spore because better medical facilities
people who live in high ivory towers ought not have the right to manage the lives of the ordinary citizens but we have ordinary citizens who worship those who live in ivory towers
keep pity yourself country fault
just open singapore of a ease all restriction restrict here and open there thinking face astonished face knocked out face thinking face
yes you are right open of a
vol to Iceland Norway plus want go back there
not exactly more like forcing people to vaccinate
stop using the tagline underlying medical conditions whenever there is a covid related death of years old underlying medical conditions just admit he died because of covid that it
不怕死的就来吧 pouting face face with symbols on mouth outing face just when we are running out of hospital beds
we are not running out of hospital beds its why a asked you to vaccinate
tourists in should not be using singapore public hospitals tourists should pay for their own stay in private hospital with better services
pm they will bring their own portable hospitals here our hospitals are for our entitled race done worry worried face
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy give singapore private hospitals some business also singapore tax payer should pay for tourist hospital bill
vol approved then please reopen geelong too
in a hurry cannot wait already ask the poppies
why would any tourist wanna come here now with two pax restrictions just go full endemic already
when they come we will revert to five pax or pax be practical fatality rate at a a is well praised by the world
they should not let those who are below by of fly if the parents want to fly with their kids who are in tax they should be on a non vaccinated travel lane flight what if the children are the carrier of the virus
we are doing very well of a are mild and asymptomatic maybe this will be helpful to you
living with covid is like sleeping with enemy
it like it let mortally come back with a bit of reality and less fear
take your pfizer and modern every six months so that you can live with covid virus
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
history tell us live with the virus slowly wait the virus die
fever not bad if our country can still afford
please open for singapore bantam as well please
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
with the current speed of spreading soon there will be new spa variant
if it has to be let it be its going to treated as a flu if we are smart enough to be pragmatic
the problem is singapore make fun of or take for a joke when a patient sincerely questions about vaccination side effects even after getting the vaccination so good luck requesting people to opt for boosters change the attitude of healthcare professionals make data available publicly of reported side effects then people might consider
you are feigning ignorance how to push that thing into your brain
hooray looking forward to travel again it is worth to take per test a quarantine when home if holidaying in first world countries thumbs up not ord world countries thumbs down
i actually thought they were hitting a devious lick in the thumbnail
i give you a prediction soon there will be can cluster
gov say singapore for sale we need people to spend money if not gov no end year bonus salary and next year no budget overpaid minister salary and no one is asking question about it even more than the united states president and russian president china and hong kong is still doing a zero covid nineteen policy singapore gov is just lazy now and try to twist and change words say can live covid nineteen is safe minister order people at the atm to work but junior doctor and nurse say i resign i have not seen the daylight for weeks minister just eye power only look at data
you are right we should pay our ministers more they work so hard day and night
he you so scared of covid that your fear can feed you and your family no need to put food on the table okay law just because you okay with living in fear like that doesn't mean everyone have to follow you okay you scared you own self lock yourself at home don't stop other people from carrying on with life we already been doing everything we can to fight covid and for so long if covid last one hundred years one hundred years you want people to self quarantine at home cannot go to work cannot eat freely cannot go out cannot travel is it
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
is there a mistake on clearing arrival immigration and on arrival per test at change airport i thought travellers must commute directly to their declared self isolation accommodation by private transport taxi or private hire car and must self isolate there until they are notified of a negative per test result so how can travellers interact with families general public and get picked up by them at arrival hall
i am confused and naive ask me to go here and go there vaccines and vaccines and ord booster vaccines when the eth vaccines due to mistakes mon plus explain i am vaccinated and naive go in and out still naive hundred point money mouth face weary face weary face face with rolling eyes yes
or here you are making noise for having everything placed nicely for you be grateful law
if only they have been bothered to listen to the plights and sufferings of fellow singaporeans they would have acquired the skill sets and critical knowledge in dealing with real issues and challenges on the ground much more effectively until this vital question is addressed reflectively by more singaporeans there is simply no reason in asking if singaporeans deserve better
best nothing to do about pushover of so were those thousands in the recent dormitory fracas pushover compared to singaporeans
bro even if diff party comes in power nothing will change diplomats will be diplomats singapore is space constraint and highly dependent on import than export so try to understand and develop the right skill
only the generations of the future will experience the destiny of this little island which was part of malaysia where all if not most of your so called dips or politicians come from if you think this can all last forever you are not standing back far enough to see the really big picture
will this complaint by joseph nathan fall in death ears by adopting an attitude of arrogance in being outright dismissive of constructive criticisms and feedback the of peoples action party politicians have yet again embarrassed the good name of singapore
vol approved but why casual football fut sal cannot when
as soon as more vaccinated get their jab do some persuasion please
cant believe this is an expert he sound like a clown with his rehearsed answers low
really how many clowns have you seen in your life including yourself
lin low you again has omaha you are the most senseless person i've encountered on youtube face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy
marie fuentes so funny and senseless that i cannot believe what i am reading
lin that's what you get when all your life all you read and hear is strait times and this so called experts you are not use to other peoples opinions and your small brain auto treat it as insults you are a perfect example of a small town small mind mindset face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
marie fuentes you are also not used to others opinions i am one of the others
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
covid vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak
you like to stay closed why are worrying so much
well singapore a few weeks ago daily cases were only a few hundred but now its a few thousand a day so prepare for heavier restrictions soon
a cat it will ultimately be good for spore to open up
then blame higher cases to the unix really site face with symbols on mouth
maria they did not blame the vaccinated for cases they just feel heart pain so many unnecessary deaths for vaccinated
i hope by end of the year all restrictions moved no more mask social distancing etc lets just live our lives normally stop using covid to control us people die every day from many things cannot stop people living just because you might die from covid die from smoking ban cigarettes die in car accident ban vehicles most people who get covid will not die just a runny nose no need to got of hospital stay home then hospital cases go down then we can open up
yeah right
and here we go
i think the job the local media does to explain the situation the facts actions and scientific background is not good enough you had also to mention that all these countries have already liberated their travelling and they have mostly a lower new infection rate as compared to singapore because their local transmissions are half and lesser than the number that singapore currently has so if risk then its rather true they risk something by coming here
be prepare the worst case yet to come life or money
do not be a fear monger do not worry too much
how is that fear mongering are you gas lighting
zed he be newbie rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing

sign pillar covid of only
of yes tell the xenophon here
we have been fighting covid for so long lock down vaccination no dine in only vaccinated can dine in non vaccinated cannot go shopping mall yet the covid cases still go up this is not normal we cant live like this forever we need to go back to normalcy people also need to feed themselves and their families if covid one hundred years then people one whole lifetime cannot travel cannot live normally because you scared this scared that law
yin saving lives and protecting livelihoods hope the vaccinated will do their part so that spore can open more easily
yin exactly singaporeans gotta realise singapore earns its money whf will lose their job sooner or later if we continue closing borders singapore is highly educated but many still do not realise this of of wasted all their years studying
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
monkey allergy and our bread must come from outside spore because there is nothing here
yin it will be useful if we all know what has what is the underlying problems for the people who pass on from covid so people with these underlying problems can avoid going out more often thus helping save lives
hah aha i like or word ignorant they give payouts all the time till covid is over the bankruptcy of construction companies resulting in incomplete bios already is a very worrying sign even the govt unable to help them what makes them think they can continue helping singaporeans in the long run with borders kept closed huh dumb fps that complain whole day but no see them coming up with better solutions
yes i think if you read enough then you would know that what are the underlying conditions the experts and mtg had said countless times
new underlying conditions can emerge is not it not just the ones that we know it is good to state what are the underlying problems for each of the death cases
sign pillar still believe in conspiracy theory who has already dismissed this statement and there are still idiots who believe that human technology is so advanced if humans can create virus we should have already migrated to mars
monkey allergy well said and insightful thumbs up thumbs up
am not are not getting malaysia second dose not gonna hurt myself
university who is arm twisted by china you do not belief in biological warfare fine that does not mean it do not exist you probably been hiding in the pamir mountains please come out
sign pillar well who in china is criticized for supporting the united states and not supporting cup there is no evidence that who picks a side for any political party you are not an expert so just shut up
sign pillar a weird trend some random dude online who is not major in biology or medicine makes sweeping conspiracy theories and believe that they are right rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing so funny you should lecture in harvard medical school rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
university no bro i am not that qualified i know why you pass are polishing chinese boots just watch you guys will go bust very shortly
dune wuhan virus is the parent go a ask i why he hide
dune racist a beings fails to understand that while delta started in india it also appeared in china which has blanket ban on indians they gave frivolous excuses that russian pilots brought it which was refuted can you xenophobic a beng use your brain which is largely used for crooked ways
dune i am least bothered on your lies seen enough xenophobic a beings in recent days so nothing to be surprised yes delta variant started in india india do not deny or lie like china there were few other variants before that too malaysia sister caught covid from her chinese colleague we do not stigmatise like some ugly people with low values indeed its wuhan virus that transcended into alpha a delta a so forth not bad for once china produced a durable product that makes the world turn just wait a see how the world treat you guys
good seven month over now open again how delta coming in the apply for permit to come prof do not talk too much cock he think variety show like to clown said can be ten thousand per day
my current worry is will singapore have our very own mutated variant if yes when will it surface mutated variant usually happened in countries that open and let covid grow freely some expert claimed that it is unlikely that covid will mutate further giving scientific explanations but who knows
i wont be surprised if we do given how dumb and stupid the government is
young north korea also close why we going to open
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
if it happens let us call it the rojas variant from combined variants of all vaccinated travel lane countries
indonesia please
you should ask indonesia gov please they ban so not other way round rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
who know maybe already ask enjoy life as much as possible while you can beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes
if three six myths can settle down my kkt chop off
fake law they say vaccination will bring numbers down now of vaccinated yet numbers increase
yin leg dormitories workers all fully vaccinated but cases coming back
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
is pretty much meaningless who finally admits per tests create false positives
probably best to stop the testing altogether unless someone is actually sick the rest is just meant to induce fear
nut it will make a lot of sense since we are living in an endemic i know the a is still concerned about the vaccinated i believe there is only much a leader can do
if they are so concerned they should stop treating them like second class people natural immunity is real
nut however we need to take care of the hospital resources too
everyday citizens dying and getting younger and these leaders just let it be no sound no words they just let pal die everyday while actively welcoming foreigners into our country without quarantine what if those foreigners bring in a mutated deadly version of covid that is resistance to the vaccine low chance does not mean no chance if that happens we will see thousands of death everyday god bless singaporeans they are assuming the virus does not mutate assumptions is the mother of all of ups
open shop already travel at your own risk
its like preparing a vegetarian buffet on the last day of did us sitar
just eat and be happy nobody knows tomorrow
what has what is wrong with that its anyone choice
a lot of international university students from south asian countries are suffering as they cannot enter singapore due to the travel restrictions these countries nepal bangladesh sri lanka and even others are doing exceptionally well with all nearly of them recording less that seven hundred cases daily we understand that it may be risky to open a vaccinated travel lane lane but perhaps consider letting them enter through a two week quarantine lane after being fully vaccinated their final exams are being held in person physically they may not be able to sit for them if the restrictions continue please understand their situation
not at the moment please we are not ready to received students
no for tourist and business men now only
so hospital beds not enough students have to wait six months for singapore covid situation to improve
put there only a handful of students that come in yearly from the blocked countries less than of of if they are fully vaccinated after quarantine for two weeks what more do you want by your logic letting in tourists and businessmen who are larger in number is more dangerous
de but the return is more businessmen if they get covid will pay for their own hospital fee in private hospital that can amount to us ask to ask for treatment they will not tax our public hospital singapore privates hospital can also make some revenue
pm its not right to assume all of these twenty odd students that would come in will get covid even if they do they are likely to have mild no symptoms and can recover at home like the of a cases in so as they are fully vaccinated you have missed malaysia point entirely though entry for students is open for students from countries with higher covid numbers some even have vaccinated travel lane lanes but south asian countries in nepal bangladesh sri lanka etc are blocked off completely even though their case numbers are much lower
de i did say the students will get covid but nobody can say for sure right anyone including myself might get it just a matter of time i just say the singapore vaccinated travel lane countries businessmen have the abilities to pay for their own private hospitalization in case they down with covid delta plus
pm yes but i am referring to students why are students from vaccinated travel lane countries allowed to enter when they even have higher covid cases and not the south asian countries i mentioned before
de because these advance countries also give singapore students free scholarship in their countries in exchange just wait patiently when singapore covid situation improved we will have vaccinated travel lane with more countries we are now busy work vaccinated travel lane with countries like japan switzerland qatar dubai use oman it take time
pm yes i understand what you mean i just hope that singapore will allow quarantined travel for united states if a vaccinated travel lane is not possible
de nine more deaths as singapore reports a of a new covid of cases today touch wood if anything bad happen to the foreign students if they here people will condemns singapore for it we prefer to be safe than sorry
unfortunately singapore has been receiving quite negative coverage in international media because of its current measures may be time to do better and have more humanity
axum today nine more deaths as singapore reports a of a new covid of cases for the students safety singapore will not allow entry for time being please wait
for nov st of of australia is allowing only australian prs and families back into the country without quarantine australian pm made a clarification after new premiers announcement
may i suggest to ban the unix from hospital or at least give them a choice to choose between getting tax or will be ban from hospital treating covid related matters and if must admit to hospital unix there will be extra of of fine to be paid first but all these under one condition that the unix remain unix for life without any mandate to be tax for life since this is about protecting the unix and not discriminating or punishing at the same time saving hospital resources i assume the unix will be able to do laundry go to school go to work eat do all things normally except going to hospital with covid related illness as above and put a stop to any discrimination towards the unix by stopping the mandate of anything into the unix body for life then we can coexist sincerely and happily let us reach a compromise and collaboration this exchange of banned from covid related hospital vaccine treatment is voluntary exchange for living a normal life without restrictions again div

once you are version texas the vex sin carries the virus toxin
covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from infection or fully vaccinated covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the variant

sacrificing people lives people die everyday there is no escape from death your love ones will die one day and malaysia loved ones will die one day i will die one day and you will die one day i agree to opening up in fact i think singapore opening up is too slow too little if it is up to me i will remove all this shitty quarantine requirements and remove all covid nineteen rules by now no more masks no quarantines no covid nineteen rules since majority will recover without long term side effects or serious side effects

the prof should stop singing underlying medical condition as excuses common as ingrown toenail sprain a amenorrhoea etc please be professional relevant and useful to mitigate the rising numbers of deaths in singapore singapore may have done better without these so call i think
yes who above the age fifty does not have any underlying medical conditions even the most of young adults today all have underlying medical conditions
sum obesity high blood pressure and cardiac problems can be reasons if they are under control there is little need to worry about people below eighty to and in particular if the person is fully vaccinated do not believe these fake apostles do believe in science
should be more precise so people with these conditions can avoid going out often that will help the citizens a lot
yes many of these like hypertension obesity or cardiac problems require long term medical therapy you would be surprised how many do not follow the instructions given by uncle doc
roll that why should disclose the underlying problems for those who pass on because of covid so people with such underlying problems can avoid going out often and that saves lives
yes i forgot to mention diabetes to hypertension obesity or cardiac problems these a
roll if so many of united states with underlying health issue which caused death government should have know better not to expose united states to covid
zed it is not singapore has one of the lowest fatalities in the world also these health problems do not go away by itself they are vulnerable
roll lowest fatalities only means we got good healthcare system which when over capacity do not mean a thing anymore
zed one of the best healthcare systems in the world and this is not the usual marketing burp but here people run around like headless chicken
roll i myself do not know what singapore is doing on one hand they restrict singaporeans movement to socialized on the other hand did not restrict incoming travel passengers i think its fine if someone tells me the increase in number of cases does not increase the number of ice and hospital bed been occupied but it does increase those two number does it
zed the government argues that the incoming travellers via vaccinated travel lane are only people who are vaccinated and tested most singaporeans are vaccinated but not tested i do however agree it is enough by now the seems somewhat overboard if the entire family is varied then there is not much reason they can not go together anywhere
roll precisely i get it that some of the population is not yet vaccinated and will be of the higher risk group as compare to those vaccinated but if that the case why some seem free of the restriction while others are not
money or life no money no life what has what is the point of life without lots of money
but when you lose or life its too late to realise its not always at money
was the point having money it money sometimes no life too
got money no life at least you can let your children use the money
yes you are right we cant eradicate travelling forever that is not living we already been fighting this for so long in every way possible yet numbers still go up people still need to feed themselves
if covid last for one hundred years and you have to quarantine at home for a lifetime and have no money to buy food to feed yourself or your family what is life about

future damn you rather laugh at sheep who outright refuse to use their brains to question anything at all if singapore can have any sort of future with people like you all i can say is good luck
offering a different opinion is not stating defamation as what to a does that is falsehood
roll by it may not happen now but eventually with covid being used as an excuse here and there to do all sorts of incomprehensible crap its becoming more of a reality than a fringe conspiracy theory
thank you masada for a single news st would segment into multiple segments and in each segment contains various subjects as long as malaysia replies are factual or relevant and befitting to the situation and serving to help the community and complying to the st online policy i think it should be acceptable but thanks for your advice i will trim to avoid being accuse of spamming i am delighted to see today so many like minded people sharing the same views to improve the situation for the benefits and life

why not do ourself and everyone a favor by locking yourself up and others can move on with their lives win win situation vaccination is not a panacea for covid social distance and lock down neither too then what do you suggest everyday there are people dying of infectious disease were you shedding tears them by insulting others as uneducated does not elevate your status juts show poor upbringing
for opening of granting free land vol i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
besides malaysians that stay in johore bar and come to work in singapore daily there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johore bar that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johore bar daily please allow land vaccinated travel lane granting free travel both ways for this group too especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or up to four pass if they are immediate family members all vaccinated also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johore bar should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane granting free land travel soonest possible this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they could not return to their johore bar homes
life is hard for them we should always remember that we are blessed these are jobs that our locals are not am not keen
the vaccinated travel lane scheme is designed with the main objective of resuscitating via and appeasing expats who have not been able to return to their home countries without quarantine when they return to singapore almost all the vaccinated travel lane countries are on sites long haul routes to europe north america and australia
now no need to go for holidays as virus still high in the world
everyone has his problem some for work etc
why not add the ferry trip from tana merak to johore last time there was a service to merging not sure why it was cancelled
good idea easier to manage ferry operation and crowd control

we need for singapore and johore check point open we cannot wait now from woodland and johore check point if can open next january or february then we can enjoy to go malaysia
and japan is not included for countries allowed to operate vaccinated travel lane flights into singapore
the vaccinated travel lane flights are stupid expense good luck with that
do not rent accommodation or even spend much here and rather spend hours travelling to and fro malaysia to earn singapore dollars by not allowing vol they will be forced to continue renting accommodation and spending on daily necessities here like other foreigners from other countries this will be beneficial to singapore economy
plus wait till of of
no such thing they are rich
best to expedite construction of the art from singapore to johore why still waiting for for change of malaysian government so much time has been wasted for the benefits of malaysia and so
thanks to the corrupt marathi who hates singapore

singapore removed from europe travel list may affect vols on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country the europe said they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid of as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources ref asia one min failed internationally

backhoe do you needs up of of
eur has bad attitude they look and to but many of them anti tax better singapore stay away for awhile from them
malaysians working here have the best of both world good job and money here and great housing and car back in malaysia shook
good for the worker who are working in singapore they cannot effort to travel by air they should working in their own country it good for economic of their country
their own country is corrupt and economy is poor because the government officials are not as competent smart corrupt free as singapore
check juan thank you
so like this so al need to consider vaccinated travel lane by swimming across as an option nah just joking ferry could also aid a controllable flow of masses for both traditional partners
if family is the priority done talk cock by saying its costly
of course la we do not need a scientist to understand the mechanism of singapore a malaysia both waiting to pluck every hair from united states
of a of a daily wait singapore build more medical facilities wait for more medical workers employed first wait for mayan places to do away with trace together wait for singapore to buy more ambulances wait for singapore to buy more test kits and test is not free for foreigners wait wait wait

sounds like your name rings true hama
we just wait and wait not only malaysia some of them going back to bantam because of kids and wife there
allow land vaccinated travel lane as a one way means for malaysians eyeing to go home for a longer period and not to and fro for frequent work maybe set a year at least
that is not vol that is one way ticket home
it is always and all about heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign
go back malaysia and do not come back forever then not expensive already
of of malaysian please go back and in came back your country have no jobs me face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
of you in a
funny singapore used to be member state of malaysia how ironically bias
pm want to go to other countries and make use of theirs system to earn money always comes with a price nothing new
this is fair to singaporeans that malaysian workers have to stay here their spending while making a living in singapore serves to benefit singaporeans too
but singapore is already over populated by keeping malaysians workers staying here it will just lead to higher housing price
a be less ungrateful
a malaysian just renting why so aggravated with unrelated factors unless you worked in hub construction or so it must be worth the hype
yak rental prices go up because of malaysians and it leads to singaporeans unable to rent because owners prefer to rent to malaysians for higher prices because they got no choice but to pay to stay in so
you asked a malaysian of course they said costly by air pressuring singapore to have vaccinated travel lane land but other foreigners missing their families have no qualm about the cost to meet them
what about all the many thousands they earned from taking jobs in so
they are doing the jobs singaporeans are not willing to do be grateful
pay the cost for the risks for both countries before that required to open vaccinated travel lane now said costly
malaysian want to earn sing dollar and go back to their landed home and spend ringgit every single day you think they stupid
wait long law by roads may be year two thousand and twenty three
silly rule of having panel doctors
panel of politicians you mean
lee after two years of pandemic we all realised doctors and politicians are interchangeable they earned both sides bank account now all full
every panel of doctors will be rejected by you guys
lin of that panel is doctors same as gucci
testing positive in overseas will be problematic and very costly travellers need to be well prepared with and know the risks
do not forget to buy tue travel insurance it cover up to of of medical expenses
put via and read fine prints like quarantine lodging accommodation requirements per tests additional communication fees food and other necessities during overseas quarantine etc are not covered others like accompanying adults cannot claim etc unless is necessary do not risk
as i have said multiples of times before safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
as i have said and proven correct gambling over as outright risky endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure
gambling to vaccination is very risky if you acc have no of a safe

want to open vol then scare here scare there better close back low
take a trouble to johore bar eat cheap food buy cheap food sahara
singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met my fellow singaporeans join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the pap to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this cause the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute it is time for a revolution revolution of our times
now is not the time to travel yet think you need to take test everyday if you get the virus in malaysia you want to stay at the hospital there or come back to singapore one more thing many malaysian out of jobs now many robbery in malaysia waiting for singaporean to go in very dangerous to go in now but if those rich singaporean dons of can go
considering the size of malaysia compared to singapore i think the malaysians is solving crimes better than singapore
why go on a witch hunt on res case and waste value resources instead on concentrating on the pandemic look now we have omicron cases at the airport we should close our border for the time being money can be earned later please have a heart for singaporeans
how can sane person go johore bar just for a day in this situation id rather stay here than taking a risk even if no test required huh
ten years pandemic have law
bring the cheap groceries sell in tue la problem solve for the shoppers
stupid to suggest and think singaporean to visit malaysia just for the fun mon man
two years can than to johore barry must rush ter coz everything cheap can go value shop may
if they do not increase petrol tax and get we will be slightly cheaper but stupid are increase liao so cannot go down viagra bustard
then why not closed the vaccinated travel lane since the spread of omicron is so great even eating in restaurants as reported the couple are being infected even fully vaccinated
vol for motor when sir
two thousand and thirty
why want to invite all the troubles a hassles onto oneself just for that day trip across the causeway
go johore bar one day need seven days of art test do not be foolish we are still in the pandemic understood vaccinated travel lane to malaysia is meant for asians working in spore to see their loved ones long vacation is required
what a stupid question who on earth will use vaccinated travel lane on day trip
if singapore can he its way no day trip at all is the mandate but what to do who is pressing for opening of borders at causeway not so
some of the singaporean might not be so happy about the government of course they have a lot to improve but compare with hong kong government they have done a lot better
so risk to malaysians going back to johore bar is not the same as risk to singaporeans going to johore bar for shopping
consider very carefully a just decided to embrace herd immunity band flung the doors wide open allowing more than a few hundred thousand cases of covid in the last few months and nearly one thousand cases in ice all for the sake of or economic growth at all cost and cheaper better faster population on i economy a treated millions of human lives as literally nothing but animals for the slaughter and or telling united states to consider carefully is there any limit tour shamelessness and hubris and hypocrisy in starting to consider maybe the cup government might be more humane when looking at their own people
don't go to job malaysia still of of cases don't saba so
of of cases but over a population of fifty million
a one case is already case too much
jan omicron is good in the words of he it is like a free mild flu like illness that gives a variable dose of vaccine through natural immunity
meaning if you go I shall I will give hard time after that he the
not for holiday
consider very carefully because your outdated clot shot does not protect you
if one day trip how many per test need to do
no where in what he said has
journalists are very nice towards peoples action party but when dealing with opposition all the tough questions comes in
journalists own by spa spa own by sin tel sin tel own by tease tease own by face with tears of joy
what is so nice
please la just because he said do not go then we do not go if so worried then closed off the vaccinated travel lane la if not just wait for things to unfold and we will see how our capable government handle it
the day singaporeans rise up that is the day all this nonsense will stop this people will keep on holding you people keep enslaving you people while they enrich their pockets through this pandemic coz all this virus its all plan to continue to push the vaccine
do not go law for the moment only really important then go support local business first
we want to support local businesses but cannot not only do businesses need our money they also demand we be vaccinated
a very responsible and capable spore govt great advice
aliyah try not to come johore bar shopping come only if necessary or important like if you have family here or if you have business here simple
all these tucker to matter to them also come first right
i wish they were as serious as handling the lies in re case
seriously you care about re issue a lot a yamaha that one peoples action party plot it so that people will forget covid and then destroy all opposition so that people will not vote i see one dumb girl make wrong al people forget how many kinds of mistake peoples action party also did first of all covid is not over there is cases here a peoples action party what they doing they do not care re case they wasted nine hours in priam singh get nothing instead net zen laughing at peoples action party now especial the cop a people supporting workers party after that you see it really hit back peoples action party a lot they nerd get rid of shang am that guy keep finding fault if re did wrong she should be in court or forever she resign ready so of done why keep dragging edwin tong potential law minister useless he look like the a boy to men recruit nerdy guy sarah alpha
enter to become the first wave of so has to get rob by those two years of hunger desperate syndicate and criminals
no more vaccinated travel lane bus ticket all sold out how to go twenty dec
can take sampan there
remove all buttons tube
be carefully in bring back amanda
in other words its not recommended saved you a click low
aida how to day trip you go the so much of the shops closed only a few there for like the tech sing chicken wrap paper go the nothing to eat for what
if you can make this statement just close the borders la vaccinated travel lane with high risk countries united kingdom and us silent
singapore needs to open borders if not we have no economy lao want to end up like job close our airports and checkpoints
cannot forever close how people going to feed their families like this
yin what I am trying to say here was going to johore bar is safer than going to us us those people disregard safety protocols like mask wearing you dun see johore bar people make protest on the street for lock owns
long are you sure it is safer to go johore bar
are you sure its safer to go to us us
long i did not make that claim that going us us is safer than job
thus the comparative statement re read helps
why give yourself stress when pandemic is not totally over you jolly well know
does anyone really think pandemic will ever be over already say get comfortable living with virus yet we open boarder to have even more intensive test when when boarder is close for what either way government has no idea what to do when new version come out each time now got omicron what is next deception
it will not be over what is the nor they are looking
no why numbers matter
long so close border and let people live in hunger is that what you want
feet do you understand what i am trying to say instead of trying to think what i am saying all this time i am saying stupid idea of singapore govt to put so much restrictions as mentioned virus never end so why stupid to put so many restrictions especially with vaccinated travel lane still swap everyday and minister still say even if vaccinated travel lane is there better not go so please be clear i do not believe closing boarder is going to be solution neither is seven days self art test with two days at supervised locations what happen you get infected at supervised locations who you think pay for quarantine at hotel so be clear to all who is reading and i am not for close borders i lost malaysia job two years ago due to close border
long so will all this measures be effective when recent news reported that sin vac jab is not effective enough to fend off omicron so what has what is the next step now
feet why ask me i want to travel also but without the need for seven days swap inclusive of two days supervised swap at other country and seven days swap inclusive of two days supervised swap when back in singapore ask the government so called expert who tell united states asymptomatic no need to wear mask now we know it was because there was supply shortage also for sin vac it is something malaysia friends and relative in china do not want to take due to side effects and so many here want to take nothing to say
long malaysia advice is better do not do any travelling at this period cos omicron is still looming and all that testings are so hassling and can be confusing
than we shown the kindness
looks who's talking the so called task force i will be very very worried if they remain to be maps after the next election
what is he try to say tai chi round the circle
no balls that's why
shut up law
be careful be very careful you never know what you will bring back was yamaha
they just want people to stay in singapore because singaporeans will spend more money on petrol and hotels locally
for the sake of business and family i willingly to take the risk
but your family willing to take risk for you or not
feet yes we all vaccinated and no underlying medical condition
bush what if variant mutated
feet do not think too much or we will not move forward
bush if you do not think deep then how are you going to be prepared
feet i trust spore mtg if happen then say
correct cannot scared covid until forever quarantine never live life to the fullest simple measures are enough wear a mask wash your hands stay one meter distance away from each other
bush what about workers party
yin if stay one metre away then how to live life to the fullest that means cannot go out dating
feet work permit i dun know
bush workers party law
feet i can a malaysian or live in spore
i am trying to get away from the peoples action party variant even for a day its super mega stronger than the omicron one
hah aha a peoples action party variant
singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met my fellow singaporeans join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the pap to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this cause the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute it is time for a revolution revolution of our times

why should travel agencies be held accountable if you or members in your party decides to vacation in germany then its on you be accountable for their own actions instead of always needing someone or somebody to look out for their personal welfare

is it news or commercial
can plus don't bring back more virus
i guess nowadays any tom dick or sally can come in the news if you buy an air ticket
why can people visit denmark where the covid cases are climbing instead of indonesia where the cases are dropping
then why is peoples action party govt still importing tourists from high infection rate countries like denmark and brunei quarantine free
what they should have shown are the ground zero where healthcare workers are struggling to keep up with the increase of patients so that the citizen understand their struggle and keep in mind to follow the measures strictly but no they show this
may cant wait to die soon
pandemic rich can travel poor cannot even eat with family because of max capacity dine in at a travellers still welcome vaccinated discriminated against vaccinated we deserve to perish
can must be desperate to hire inst grammars for a news segment
how much extra did they pay
distasteful reporting the standard of channel news asia reporting has levelled to the gutter
i have noticed that lately
why the huge difference
he is right to burst the he sin travel buddle coiled by the useless on simply love hong kong and their effectual governance
showing people happily travelling while jobs are being lost and fully vaccinated people are squeezing out rooms for self isolation in hub thanks to our dear leaders
lunch be jelly if you no marine ghost germany like no vita zen zen poor hub peasants should learn to work hard instead of complaining on youtube so can live condo like no vita zen zen
why is singapore peoples action party govt screening lavish europe lifestyle travelling during a pandemic where people are losing job
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
what happened to paps promise of the promised to open up after of vaccination
perverted action party

next door neighbour such as indonesia and malaysia are being shut off germany open singapore promoting to attract it via their new plan of covid nineteen green lanes
this is outrageous shut at home for commoners and travel pass for the rich elite high end we are treated as fool in our homeland
this is ridiculous the interview is basing europe like its a war zone
why of the dislikes thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down
please report if they happen to die
guys please do not be sold by the word safe they should have people communicating this shell wear a mask at all public places
when vaccinated singaporean cannot even eat outside with family of a group of six vaccinated travellers can go to germany for holiday is not that weird
don come back being test positive
was go out of singapore you are saved liao
hopefully they can open up lanes to more countries soon especially europe korea new zealand australia and possibly hokkaido in japan where it is more rural
just a very honest and curious question here not making fun of anybody here do singaporeans pronounce
ridiculous to allow imports in under vaccinated travel lane to gallant all over spore but impose severe restrictions on own locals new variants like my will or may already have arrived
just open up la seriously this virus have a fatality of a of and of can recover at home for a of you are willing to decimate the entire economy and eat up all our reserves it takes common sense to know that we are overreacting to a virus that we have gotten used to this is coming from someone who has gotten the virus geez
but two can take grab taxi but of can take bus and of a can take art
and how trips germany from singapore yeah only the rich can do it
what a trashy family
i know her its that tito girl grinning face with smiling eyes
low all the poor singaporeans being salty in the comments
no vita looks like sheds talking to her crush
people are dying just buying food why is this group travelling what common sense is this
the travellers are quite brave to agree to be interviewed to be honest i expected more poorly conceived needless negative comments that serve no purpose except to show the extreme bias and misdirected bitterness of the commenter
they sold a tested on their return as to make sure they do not bring in covid of virus
of yes they did do not feel so scared
lin almost knew cases daily many many people confirm scared
hong even scared we must be gracious is not it
lin die graciously ghost mission impossible
hong impossible is nothing graciousness is breed head high shoulder straight
germany now has eth wave delta
are they volunteer suicidal pig face
us commoners can never dream of this only rich people can afford to go on these type of trips
lao two influences big fat hairy deal
pm of lunch be jelly you is notch rich and famous as them rah
low what am i watching smiling face with tear
if got covid there then bring it back to so thank you can vaccination not of a may
probably ken covid and that it
she look aged fast
inst gram is full of photo shop
that's why channel news asia did not use filters
wow so much inspiration travel to germany so much money
and they say they are doing things to stop the spread of the virus
who says we are closing this is st step to opening
used to be communist propaganda prevalent not now the age of vaccinated propaganda has arrived
and when these group of pal return they start to spread delta variant in singapore and gov will say it is normal really selfish to max
no one cares what is she reading off notes or smith
what has what is the point in covering this when we have gone back to the two pax restriction here just to rub it in to those who cannot travel and no vita lam proving how the typical dense singaporean girls are
she went to germany to find more guys
i think its fine just got to be safe
spot on the risk is not catching the virus but the restrictions your home countries will set on you if you catch it
i would just enjoy malaysia extra time in germany and whf from there anyway life there is probably more normal and less stressful than how it is in singapore
they will not close borders for citizens law
this is surreal fully vaccinated people go on a holiday trip and get interviewed because of that and then reporter is asking as the covid situation evolves i cannot hear that supermarket announcements anymore what made you go on that trip please people wake up get you life back stop being so anxious
can waste their money for these six fools whoever suggest this idea must be the biggest wanker what does this coverage have impact for singapore or global like are covid germany is top three country that sporran visited is it obviously no layperson face palming female sign
why are you so triggered we have to eventually return to normality you really want to forever be in state of alarm
funniest thing is india pm visited united states and no major global news channels cover it hah even heard that ord tier united states administration which welcomed mode wow so much for big country of a a billion face with tears of joy
no vita lam is too overrated anyway
vaccinated does not mean you cannot get the virus you can still get covid a they do not has to quarantine after coming back dangerous
scripted how about the govt zooming in to this group as lab mice to test for the virus once they are back in sin report the stats to united states sporrans old be dying to know the outcome
influence what exactly high educated must read script a low
this is hilarious face with tears of joy suddenly a traveller becomes a authority in covid low
are you jealous anything else to say
lin not at all just watching all this stupidity around me
soma anton cannot live like a tortoise who does not know what is happening outside
lin if propaganda is the way to create awareness good luck are jealous of the tortoise turtle thinking face
soma anton anyway nobody is forcing you to travel and we do not know whether you can or not
lin and you think that is a good idea right
we need to start an in erection travel to johore bar giant club challenge i rather trust that to prevent need for oxygen tanks
if only all the unnecessary travel is halted many poor people will be getting their meals also unnecessary travel contributes to global warming the next pandemic for which there is no vaccine face with rolling eyes
is it her fault to be rich be gracious and give her a break
lin can her richness prevent the future disaster although her refraining from such trips can save the world
is tat the reason the open the birder air germany
influence so desperate to travel and get some pics for inst gram
are you very jealous because of this int this her right to travel and appear on can
these influences are such a waste of space on earth they literally have no talent just look pretty and get paid millions low
she has she is already rich in the first place low
tan king a how the rich get richer post photos with luxury bags and tai tai lifestyle

the united states said trips to singapore have become more dangerous because of the corona virus raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hub from almost covid free to covid full would india be next to advise against travel to singapore
they gave the same advisory on he
lin not quite united states cd raises covid of travel health notice for singapore to level a united states cd raises covid of travel health notice for hong kong to level a the cd is highest travel health notice is level a
yesterday two thousand two hundred and thirty six cases a five deaths then of
united states cd announced this morning that travel warning for hong kong was raised in error on monday so hong kong remains at level a singapore raised to level a highest level is level a won plan to open up just backfired
lin stop spreading fake news
what does this lane mean if someone is tested positive and is fully vaccinated are they allowed to fly back
if tested positive quarantine for twenty one days
tan a what i meant was if the test in germany showed positive before the flight in other words we are unfortunate enough to get covid whilst travelling what happens then
prior to boarding return flight they have to take a per test only if the result is negative they will be allowed to board back in singapore they have to take one per at airport then two more over the next few days
bloom berg the united states said trips to singapore and hong kong have become more dangerous because of the corona virus raising its travel health advice for the asian financial hubs by one level the united states center for disease control and prevention said anyone who hasn't been vaccinated should avoid non essential trips to singapore citing a high level of covid of all travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading covid variants the cd said increasing its travel advice for singapore by one notch to level a
while united states still posts higher infection rates than singapore and he stop using the united states as the gold standard please
hey us speak for yourself
its hilarious that the united states posts advisories against any country when they have more covid cases than everyone else
in germany singapore is still considered a safe destination though
next target of then of daily cases for tiny 720km² island kan dating
what has area got to do with anything what you need to look at is cases population also singapore does much more testing than any other country so of course the number of cases will be high
i would travel out of this country asap if given any opportunity as well just by looking at this comment section filled with insufferable citizens with perpetual negativity people that only know how to whine and complain at everything is enough to make anyone to of this shit hole place
giving scripts to social media influence is is considered news now how far has channel news asia fallen
we are running out of conspiracy theory from two weeks to flatten the curve to vaccine passport fascism is making a comeback clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
of voted for this
grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face upside down face upside down face upside down face
list to malaysia words all of you in just slave in the system of lucifer slave controller or slave all slave no difference all die in the end this is lucifer satan system not complying and untied is or way deep state repent or die
know your audience channel news asia please
can audience just targeted propaganda
all the salty comments while i personally would a the big deal to get everyone all riled up
the ones at home are bearing the consequences of those travelling and bringing the disease back home that selfish
the ones at home are already producing one thousand six hundred cases a day importing a few more hardly makes a difference in fact those imported cases are almost always detected through multiple per tests local cases are not always detected and spread more
there are only five import case say hi to the one thousand five hundred local community cases waving hand
teen where was it before of of less than of everyday import import import now see what happened
and you dare to say you very well knew lives are at risk because of this selfish
yous a bit perplexing as to why this is news face with tears of joy
i guess they also brought portable oxygen tanks and portable ice monitors while travelling
what they will not tell you is how many came back positive
wads the fun in such ways measures in travelling
so many dislikes is it because no vita showed up or what
can see a bunch of sour grapes lolly
you catch the virus your problem
hey you forgot to add the paid advertisement tag
totally scripted so obvious she is reading pm a script
supporting lavish lifestyle travelling during a pandemic where people are losing job well done can
we saw months and months of news report and articles about people losing their jobs one report about people travelling and you lose your mind
if you look at it from another angle they are actually providing jobs in the tourism industry keep your perspective open a
green is not productive
and give her a break its not her fault to be rich and able to travel
lee how many in tourism industry being helped and how many families now suffering under home recovery and covid cases
in the other news thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
these reporters is much better she does not make everything sound depressing the strait times people are just sage
I have got friends posting their trips to malI haves united kingdom and united states now on inst why are we acting like these trips to germany are all that special
used to be communist propaganda prevalent not now the age of vaccinated propaganda
so cannot get their local act together yet govt open up borders but restrictions imposed on its citizens unbelievable
how to be famous during covid i travelled while other pal cant got featured on can channel news asia you are all time low now
no vita is already fees what
germany now has eth wave delta
what a waste of her time to be talking to channel news asia while on holiday her parents must love air purifiers
awareness for united states who are scared
of dislikes on video one hundred and sixty media doing so well
she all knew the interview questions prior her answers are not am not thought of on the spot she keeps looking down at what i presume to be her notes
this is the propaganda tool by our fax govt
even when they are doing propaganda material the actors actresses are still not up to par yet
that is normal for organized interviews if you have done or organize an interview before this is normal process interviews question are often shared to prepare for interviewee the interview though something some reporter might digress to get a headline out of the interview
a do know this is the norm right they are not being questioned for wrongdoings most of the celebrities interviews are like that too

this indochinese girl is super rich and an influence on inst gram nice marketing by channel news asia to engage someone like her
crazy to travel at this time no need to flaunt face with rolling eyes face with rolling eyes face with rolling eyes
crazy to travel at this time face with rolling eyes
please give me a time frame you think is suitable to travel when covid hit zero cases worldwide because that's never going to happen we are all of vaccinated and of if we exclude a of age range if you re not willing to open up then just stay home and let people do what they please
group of six can travel overseas but fully vaccinated groups of five cant eat out together face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
puppets with their muppet logic back to two to dine in
travelling and eating are two different things
so many tables to choose so why worry dine in two or more
feet so are you saying its more risky for vaccinated folks to be out eating than travelling
thanks for hitting those sly foxes on the right spot a
rod depends if you eat outside during travelling but mask off when eating definitely higher risk than walking around with mask on also depends if where you are going high risk or not need context for fair answer
rod eating surely more risky cos mouth open all times eating and talking also air around is stagnant while travelling lowest risk cos people moving around and mask on all the time so hope you see the logic
feet tell me on a long haul flight from singapore to frankfurt absolutely no food nor drinks are served to the passengers
this country is for the rich
who ask you to be so easily swayed by the hidden hands pressure
cookie you mean the of that took the wonderful super spreader mana jab
in the other news thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
and we talk about net zero emissions face with rolling eye thinking face
no natural beauty women are always lucky
if you were to read from a script wouldn't reading from a monitor be much better to make it look less obvious
why this channel has more dislike face with tears of joy
young losers cannot face the truth
she looks cute
now so many people get because of the fake test it people must be crazy to come to singapore
a clicked on this video because of no vita lam
possess tell me singapore is not paying this over privileged fools leisure travelling with ordinary singaporeans folks tax payers money
enjoy yourself safety and healthy
seriously why need a script all our education fail such interviews need to be scripted or now singapore is closet communist
did they hire inst grammars to promote travelling now
young i sure can but how is that relevant to malaysia question
no they re from wuhan tourism board
not to promote travelling but to promote government propaganda its cheaper to pay inst grammar instead
fake account spewing pile of poo pile of poo pile of poo
hopefully live back to normal
so she is happy that a group of six can travel trying to entice the unafraid and untaxed pal to do the silly plunge
feel free to die from covid then stay poor
so you like to curse people i bless you health and long life
to nah stupidity will be its own reward don't need to curse anyone life will take care of you
so channel news asia what made this as a news so do we need to congratulate them for being able to travel the world has opened a long time ago only singapore has not low
did not you read the salty comments some thinks singaporeans should be hermits and stay home forever this is news to them low
basically they re travelling all over the place all the time
exactly they really thought all singaporean are fools who read only channel news asia or st news vaccinated non vaccinated all can travel as long as they fulfill the arrival country covid regulations
why so salty low you do not have to watch every single video channel news asia releases right to me it was pretty insightful to learn how other countries and people are different countries are dealing with covid and
forgive them they are losers probably our base
hart no have some backbone and boycott them you are like a via member here spewing nonsense
of dislikes thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down soon to join pc in korea in bottom five

in the other news thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
go until so chum total waste of money and time
she got money to waste low low low she part of the part of society
what group of a not of pax thought many pal sign up good old days of ask goes johore bar on weekend what so great to be delighted with this at this serious juncture forgotten just germany and brunei even hong kong did not join in bubbles
young this wave is a times more serious than of of a lot of pal pretending to be life as normal scared yes just got by guy in below reply scared go tax think time will tell who right who wrong
covid vaccine has the structure of his same as covid nineteen virus to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new covid nineteen variant the virus will permanently stay at human body
insensitive reports from channel news asia to glamorise this travel group at a time such as now when many singaporeans are suffering from lack worry and grief
on the contrary it provides relief that we are prepared to live with covid of whats with all the negative comments here gosh
it her fault to be able to travel give her a break i smell envy from miles away
what can one expect pm freedom of press soon to join a korean pc in bottom five
do not even need travel just hear the mask already dylan
my one rich friend has many good class bungalows he shared with me gap growth to him is more important than anyone else in the world because his investments and wealth is directly linked to gap he feels that gap growth should be at all cost its directly in his own self interest he loves influx as it reduces cost to his businesses using cheaper labour
she has she is reading from a script lao
nothing surprising
i mean can you come up with what to say or remember the script i cant
speaking on to not easy law many would write down so you wont look stupid stuttering and forgetting its a smart thing to do
obj she had to say on the lines of being concerned about the ongoing pandemic and insecurities of the travel lane but in reality if you go to europe one will feel much more free unmasked outdoors feeling normal in the somewhat more rural areas in the city as long as observe cautious distancing wear mask indoors and vaccinated its fine
if you re ever interviewed for the news you'll know that writing a script greatly helps you to answer the questions as detailed as you can without going off point stuttering or having long awkward pauses so there's nothing ridiculous about reading off script if you wrote it yourself with your honest answers
you all book or what obviously when talking about issues like these they will share with her the ans they will ask so that she will not blank out on live to right so if she prepared the ans and just wrote down to prepare herself that normal what the only thing you can ham is her memory cut la
germany has average of a of a daily cases this week that's not exactly fine its always fine until its not but if course risk is on the traveller you choose your own risks if you get sick there and are stuck there the expenses and troubles you face are they worth it that's all
loan hub chen soon to join a korean pc in bottom five
another thing to note if the occupants in your flat do not have the same travel history as you you must self isolate in a room with an ensure toilet otherwise you have stay in a hotel to wait for your arrival test result if it fails go back to quarantine protocol
us as cd online database vars it shows of a of a people reported serious side effects after the tax with of of a death to is vars has gov
bow which travel insurance did she buy which didn't require a part before her departure to germany as far as i know if you do not take the part prior to leaving singapore the insurance policy will be effective only on and after the with day of the travel this means if you have covid before the with day you will not be covered for covid related illness in addition the risk of failing the part before returning to singapore you will have to stay in germany for at least including quarantine period twenty one days before you are allowed to return to singapore that is if you pass the part after twenty one days in germany so have to prepare for all these unexpected expenses which may not be of a covered by the travel insurance just hope that the singapore govt can look into this and relax the restrictions a bit otherwise it doesn't help much of having a vaccinated travel lane scheme
of great we are placing much restrictions within the country but outside in is open borders great job games i recall how delta was brought in
i will go anywhere with no vita lam whether there covid or not
even inside so the beaming face with smiling eye rolling on the floor laughing

if they can enter singapore why we cannot come out of the hwy kwan home in angina penang village bangkok green after gotten influenza shot two covid vaccines and a booster is the vaccine proper or correct vaccines bought by singapore government is singapore save after the vaccines dying increases why
here we prevent there are those coming and going to get infected aida how long we going on life like this things are getting more expensive even hawker food rented out to foreigners at higher rental dun expect to sell reasonable price also bad attitude by food stall noticed in hawker centre takeaway boxes are charging much more buy five pets need to pay extra a of or more for boxes wat should we do now can govt help united states thu
why not norway offs
why now you want to she the shot
beware to those countries i must say look at germany situation now covid is out of control ever since they re opened border with singapore
remind me again who pay their salaries
what have salaries got to do with this poor whiner
the first ever vaccines in the world to grant immunity from logic
do not understand the xenophobia against indian subcontinent everyone blames india for spreading delta variant as if we did it on purpose people forget where did the actual pandemic begin grow up people opening the borders is the only way out plus the government is doing it in a step by step calibrated manner if something goes wrong vols will be halted stop blaming one country or one nationality for your perils last i check we are all in this together
why cant we see how many dislikes on this channel anymore damn i missed seeing the dislikes loudly crying face loudly crying face
the whiners had woken up
face with tears of joy
how about the other way around will they allow singaporean to enter their country do not you think singapore always get bullied by other countries even by its neighbours
vol for all foreigners still have to apply vaccine travel pass while singaporean exempted and they just buy tickets and travel use vol nobody is getting bullied
cannot wait to see this global covid scam fall into shattered pieces
hello how about us my hubby and i would like to visit singapore we are from the philippines fully vaccinated already can we enter year february of of thank you very much smiling face with heart eye smiling face with heart eye smiling face with heart eyes
i hope so and i think we will open to philippines too
and still no philippines as the distribution of vaccines really slow there's only of of fully vaccinated while the rest still on process of getting their second jab cant blame singapore govt if philippines still not on their vaccinated travel lane lanes but hoping they'll consider united states in near future god bless singapore
the irony is we have sufficient vaccines here but the makers are making a mockery out of them these makers are a lost race
why not algeria sad but relieved face
so from jakarta indonesia to singapore a does the person need to be inside indonesia for more than fourteen days minimum before flying our from indonesia to singapore
if you are concerned about progress then just stay in your bedroom and shudder
well said they are a frightened lot
if singapore can open vaccinated travel lane lane to india when their cases are one of the worst in the world i do not open to all there are some hide agenda what crap are they hiding from united states
things slightly stabilise and the government brings in more problems cant understand this besides do we need these people i sure as hell don't think so
cannot shut down borders forever
life is for living and not hiding
my hair started falling when i see india is included we do not have many rivers like theirs big problem coming
currently singapore is more threat to india than india to singapore look at the percentage population if you do not know maths then better change your tutor
management yeah no it does re extremely bad at logic
your hair is not our major concern
for few you think tourist
india has reported between of of a to of of a cases per day given the population of india that's far less than singapore is infection rates also look at the size of singapore and look at the size of india singapore is a lot more dense than india is chances of covid spreading here more rapidly is greater than in indians at this moment there's a lot of herd immunity being built up there finally when singapore is borders were closed that was when most of its cases were spread india was closed to singapore most if not all cases in singapore have been internally spread id suggest that you connect the dots better
are not am not come back
he should go to india one rape in every sixteen minutes hah aha
yong so you live in a rape free society
did i heard wrongly maybe new variant so these travellers gonna each bring home a lock down tow
currently singapore is more threat to india than india to singapore look at the percentage population if you dons number and singapore covid cases and then talk
management watch channel news asia lately a reporter wearing mask doing news report in the street and behind him many walk without wearing mask in crowded street how genuine is the infection rate reported imagine social discipline in the rural area face with hand over mouth
india has more herd immunity than us
face with hand over mouth
most agree thumbs up
singaporean do not go other countries and spread virus there stay put face with tears of joy
xxx other countries will accept singapore because we do not produce fake certs to work or travel rolling on the floor laughing
you guys still good in forge documents hama
xxx rolling on the floor laughing you make whole world laughing at a rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
still google microsoft ism pepsi co and other leading company are handled by indian co i must say indian fake certificate are better than your original
management rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing is that the only thing you can say coming out from toxic air polluted country another one making whole world laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
yes looking forward to go bantam again
oops singaporean should stay in their home country at least until their gov managed to put covid under control
singapore are like being locked in the cage allowing external to infect united states but yet cannot leave
really we are an open society must open otherwise we will cease to exist try to live like everyone else
why not it talk as your country no covid at all singapore still considered high risk yet other country agree with vol if scared dig a hole and live there
most cases are internally spread
are we really under restrictions look at mall and other places seems like nobody gives a damn either
please think about bangladesh Bangladesh
it will be soon we will finally open to all countries
so illogical india and indonesia included but not thailand in addition travellers from singapore to thailand enjoy quarantine free travel
precisely
india is for own into is for maids a think for tourist
thailand is for the a per at massage spa
and a you also a pear like to go pocket
vaccination rates total insanity
did thailand want to have vaccinated travel lane too probably thailand just want to close their border longer
and sprouting nonsense
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing that was before covid let alaska
waiting for japan
no need quarantine delivery riders in singapore need to be monitored as the do swab at a test center weekly foreigners no need correct me if i wrong
covid is the best thing that has ever happened to united states as it allows united states to whf
wonderful the living has to go on living clapping hands light skin tone thumbs upright skin tone party popper confetti ball
please consider philippines also to have vaccinated travel lane please number of cases there are low already been away from family for yrs already disappointed face
it will be opened soon to philippines
thank for noticing malaysia comment sir
channel would be great when philippines is included take care
the term vaccinated travel lane reminds me of disabled toilet if it is disabled it cannot be used a travel lane is a lane that is vaccinated how
open to all country la easy to understand
open vaccinated travel lane lanes but causeway have not open with
pecos when we have dormitory covid outbreak in of of they shut united states out a yamaha
causeway is used up to of of commuters daily vols only ask load since opening do not be stupid
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil
yah would be really keen to know the singapore governments criteria on which countries to include in the vol
how a all know the countries aren't already discussing with singapore or it is the other country that is against the vol
buy india cases are so bad and they open vaccinated travel lane to them why not other country which are safer they have some agenda that is hidden from us
into is for maids low
vaccination rates total insanity
probably vaccinated travel lane with those countries are also because of corporate business related not just tourism singapore and thailand not much businessmen travelling back and forth for corporate related reasons if not mistaken mostly is for tourism related activities
not every country want to do vaccinated travel lane lane vaccinated travel lane lane have to come upon both party in the first place
malaysia on of really
buy they only have one criteria any country that is vaccinated with pfizer is of to coming in regardless of their situation
rent helps to make more super spreaders
hah its true though singapore are re opening their border with countries far away from them why because most as an neighbours are using sin vac and a vaccines face with tears of joy face with tears of joy but hey seeing what happen in germany right now I am glad they did it
rent interesting look what is happening now in europe another covid surge european countries consider further lock owns after another surge in covid cases bic news
rent even if that country has very high daily cases
because they belittle us they think that we are poor knowing that singapore is a small country and can vaccinate the entire population in less than a month
indonesia currently have one of the lowest infection rate in the region with some days positivity rate a few active cases remaining and i us mostly empty in march two thousand and twenty one serology survey showed of of people in jakarta already exposed to covid with the july august spike and vaccinations i think we may have achieved herd immunity sadly at the cost of many lives lost our govt need to be careful because studies show immunity only last about ninety days so there's risk of new wave in december january
brown nosing obviously us a and united kingdom farts smell better i guess
of wheres japan
up not ready for you so how about johore of beaming face with smiling eyes
india where hundreds of thousands died earlier this year
person shrugging light skin tone male sign
my suggestion is educate yourself first about current covid situation in all countries with a vaccinated travel lane status otherwise you end up embarrassing yourself with your stupidity
and china not even vaccinated travel lane but category one can travel without quarantine and just test hama brush stop being salty let this people use vaccinated travel lane and meet their loved ones
yeah many died you don't worry jim plus take care lock or door and rest in or room be safe
I am a student and i have not been back home in india in two years I am glad they have opened everything up
hope you have a safe travel happy to hear that
happy your leaving a going home please do take care back in indian try to start afresh there good luck
happy for you man have a safe travel and happy reunion with your family
yes go back india do not come back please
ignore this negative salty dogs comments finally we are allowed to travel and meet our family members safe travel brother enjoy
two thousand and sixteen so very rude and uncivilised shameful comment brat
two thousand and sixteen so i hope you do not have to face such time where you cannot see your parents for more than two years because of a global pandemic coz if you did you wouldn't survive watch your words
take care and be safe
two thousand and sixteen so sure bro I shall I will take your mon along with me need a snack for the flight anyways
singh ask yourself who to blame for unable to go back earlier the whole world is suffering but nobody trying to find out where virus is coming from very sad
so singapore doesn't recognize and believe in natural immunity anymore right how about an honest answer
vol india person facial inflight skin tone male sign
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil
yeah i know shocking a of a cases on ave in india in nov fifteen is so much higher than united states of a of a cases a day united kingdom of of a cases germany of of a cases st country with vaccinated travel lane with singapore less than one month ago person face palming male sign
today record eighteen deaths yeah right
they do not care about death they only care money
two thousand and sixteen so do you care about money
this is really especially india
when we are not able to stop the spread in our own country people should refrain from pointing finger at other countries the new numbers are speaking for themselves every country had worked hard to contain the spread some managed immediately and some after learning a hard lesson let us support each other and let the economy grow again our fellow citizen suffer due to no hospitality business almost closed let us support the calculated and cautious approach by govt of so if things become bad singapore govt will take necessary action
anthony speaks volume of a person
a its literally two jabs
why so selective does this mean we also can travel to this it countries if we are fully vaccinated any testing requirements
vol means quarantine free if you are fully vaccinated
i think one have to bear their medical fees if they are positive when back to so
no if his status is vaccinated
great going singapore thumbs upright skin tone
thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
I am just waiting for japan i miss malaysia second home

when the of or you govt going to let those una eat a go into shopping mall since you letting indian indonesia coming in
did fisher because there is no difference anymore now people have to live with it
hmm even when fully vaccinated there really a culling project by the government
mon better make boosters mandatory before this happens
the daily mon report should include all vaccinated travel lane travellers count and all covid of cases mild or critical for cases related to them asap serious citizen can only dine in two now you allow of of a a workers to roam around freely every week
stupid law rite we singaporean from two thousand and twenty still at two and five others can come in ska ska without quarantine later case high we singaporean affected by the rules again
low you singaporeans should look at what is happening in germany right now their cases are soaring at even worse level than a year ago coincidence it happened after they re opened their border with singapore face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy

thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
really unhappy to receive this news why allow foreigners into the nation without quarantine and worse yet to allow certain migrant workers to leave for their homelands with ease especially those whom have irreparably tarnished the lives of singaporeans forever there seems to be no consequences what about the citizens whom have had their kindness taken as a weakness also the government could do better to protect the livelihoods of its citizens by reducing foreign competition it is most disheartening
seriously what kind of plur
are you high
then you must be low
no empathy at all in this post which foreign worker has tarnished singapore image maybe buck up and do your best rather than faulting other people

amazing post mate bit hit of in trading volume on day a was the second largest etc launch ever and was nearly the most traded etc overall yesterday if the sec was concerned about demand from institutions for a bit coin based etc they can set those aside and go ahead and approve a real etc we were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps narrowly avoiding a long term bear market this is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many do not back up their cry to assets more emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market i have made over twenty three etc from day trade with william derrick insights and signals in less than four weeks this is one of the best medium to backup your assets in case it goes bearish

extreme idiot strategy when we were cleaned overseas dirty we closed borders to avoid virus flowing in now we too are dirty so no difference to open borders to let virus flow in it will only make the situation from already worse to unbearable
cup and its core supporters should be tried for crimes against humanity
just open border between singapore and malaysia please
for opening of granting free land vaccinated travel lane with malaysia i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
he is very arrogant in his comments but he is far from the old guards
not fit to be health minister
challenge virus to prove you are the elite too bad cases getting more and more what next step down
of a of infected get mild to no symptoms and you destroy the economy to protect the a a protecting the seniors that did not take the tax why did they not take it in the first place if you want to be pro choice do not differentiate between tax status if not you are just spitting in the face of those who chose not to take it if you really want of a tax rate for those eligible why not mandate it why bother saying but place all sorts of restrictions on those who refuse it who are you trying to kid
id why you guys are criticising them so much if you are so pro then go and compete in the parliament law you are saying that they are talking nonsense when you are the ones who talks nonsense you do not even have the balls to compete for parliament so just shut up
getting elected does not meant one can abuse their authority to discriminate and coerce people into experimental vaccine yes nothing can be done to them but this will reflect on their next election
honestly majority we singapore a vaccine we follow the rules the next booster but never end how to stop this covid nineteen singapore have to adapt this covid singapore will dining five people but not stays same household what the points take booster if every days go up we got another special booster again
its about making
still have not stop about this matter
the real clown face
are the participants of the bloom berg forum a different species of humans why they can dine in is whereas locals are restricted to two if all travellers are checked before coming to singapore why are there still imported cases are there vaccinated travellers with forged vaccination documents ism sure there are countries where fake documents can be obtained under the table resulting in imported cases
social distancing everywhere dining in for only a everywhere distance of a a meters between people and tables and then the big surprise on the singapore airlines planes there are sitting nine passengers in one row no a a meters distance more then two people sitting together and eating their meals joke right
as reported by vars shingles a of a
please institute minimum wage for ministers

when are we allowed diners four per table like in weddings a family of four should be allowed
on be clown
what happen to the b16172 strain virus is this bad boy virus still active
now bicycle hit the wall already beaming face with smiling eyes
why health ministry still described the surge in covid cases death rates as unusually high the sore thumb group walking freely around in singapore are the quarantined tourists as non fully vaccinated cannot enter malls nor dine out locals discouraged by govt to socialise outside locals cannot visit loved ones in nursing home foreign construction workers restricted from leaving their dormitories
stupid to spent billions on vaccine that don't immunize people from the so call pandemic virus but little on therapeutic treatments even denial ling drugs that are cheap like in erection that is effective indeed refusing to accept positive study cases like merck on the effectiveness demonizing people even doctors who found over martin effective
because the government issued over us of billions of bonds in debt ltd of of that more than of of gap issued in ten months government running out of money but this will backfire as domestic consumption will weaken other countries have no travel advisories to singapore and domestic activity will slow sheer stupidity
singapore need vaccines from india get more doctor and scientists and political from india thumbs up medium light skin tone
singapore government so full of cowards
madness and desperation
is he one of de candidate to be next pm gone case wish our sky still around now we really miss him
i noticed most of the a gong elite tasked to covid are either wearing specs and or have very small eyes no wonder they cannot see what they doing properly
what everyone wants to know is whether the government has been fiddling with the daily number of new covid of cases just how on earth did the number of new cases jump from three thousand two hundred and seventy seven cases on of of of to five thousand three hundred and twenty four cases on of of of then suddenly dropped back to three thousand four hundred and thirty two cases on of of of please explain mon
what will happen to the daily cases when we open up travelling again
as a task force for covid of their solution is to live with the virus may i know what is the task force been set up by the government in the first place what is their objective toward this mission what the heck are they talking about five thousand plus infection as on of of of of is this their goal someone said they had applied a good strategy on the covid of wow so the five thousand plus infection and the increase number of death is the good strategy that it mean what the heck are they talking about is this peoples action party government in the next election are they going to tell singapore that they had done a good job with the control of the covid nineteen virus are they going to say that without them singapore will not have a good strategy on how to deal with the virus what the task force minister need most is a mirror and we singaporean need is a miracle really low no this time round is cry out loud without tear
an intelligent leader will know when to shut up shushing face this taskforce is all about the number games a their investment in biotech

how can it be safer to open up to other countries with lower infectious when they still have infectious rate i can understand we need to open up but this point he made is puzzling
look at all the boomers in the comments go off at each other so fun to watch
quote the opinions of one hundred men are useless if they know nothing about the subject question why is prof paul tab yah not heading the task force what do you clowns know about the virus

malaysia and singapore are working to finalise more open and convenient travel arrangements there should not change the protocol like or not both need to apply fourteen days quarantine at their own expenses
I have been making losses trying to make profit myself in trading i thought trading demo account is just like trading the real market can anyone help me out or at least advise me on what to do

i stumbled upon one of his clients testimonies and decided to try him out and now in expecting malaysia third cash out soon
here in carlton expert or yong sheol carries out the both orientation and mentorship potentials
how does this bit coin trading of a thing works ism interested in it and ism willing and ready to invest heavily in it but ism gonna need an assistant from any trusted and productive professional
you don't really need someone to tell you how it works you can make research on your own and also try doing it yourself
or yong sheol is indeed a bit coin trading and investment gods with malaysia first deposit of a of a i also got a payout of a of a in a week red heart is not that amazing
i remember friends calling me crazy when i started but i now shut up them with malaysia four figure weekly returned smiling face with smiling eyes
its not about watching videos and wasting your time on strategies i was ignorant doing so so i decided to try or yong sheol and ever since then he has made about of of a for every a of a i trade with him

have you people heard of vaccinated will not it post
why because money but high risk country now no one come
you are purposely scaring people with numbers that see you restrict people from eating sugar and fat to get those numbers down there are less then three hundred people who died in grand total in singapore that is the truth now stop lying and stop over exaggerating and stop scaring people you are evil
why is govt prioritizing economy over lives
arch yes the metaphors and analogies a

breaking cartels attack texas border after the pretend dent by on withdrew all border agents militias rushing to border also haitian force of armed illegals entering at another unguarded opening

based on consent well i wonder in an environment where data is not shared transparently and there coercion tactics used is consent of the willing and informed kind
he speaks yet cant make any sense
i do not get the negative comments in these section it is mandatory for the travellers to test negative before they arrive to singapore even if there are some breakthrough cases what is the big issue there are already thousands of cases in singapore if you believe in vaccination then the only thing you should worry is when the govt grants permission to allow vaccinated people inside the country everyone in the world is going to get covid at some point of time keep that in mind just because you restrict it is not going to stop the infection it may delay it but not stop it
keep hiding the vaccination status of the recent dead from the reporting to the public why the lack of transparency when peoples lives are on the line so disingenuous
thank you of thank you so very much blood is on your hands for voting these bunch of clowns talking nonsense and flip flop everyday and most of all no accountability
out of these of maybe of are the ceca who converted to singapore citizens
you know what has what is funny peoples action party can win of of the popular vote and still have a majority in parliament because of how arcs work popular vote does not matter in singapore elections in general with the arcs
i am not kidding should united states singapore citizens genuinely do a united states and storm singapore parliament i am seriously fed up of all this look what happened in hong kong in thailand who says asians cannot deal with incompetence
kos what happened in hong kong and thailand was not spontaneous the people did not protest against government incompetency they destroyed their own city because they were paid by foreign forces like the united states and india
is gay so what a want burn a
kos good luck dealing with the death penalty later
their policies are rubbish if by what you say protect the vaccinated is your priority then why allow those medically exempted to go into malls malaysia goodness are not am not they the most vulnerable
i am surprised that he is so naive to say that vaccinated travel lane is for business but not for leisure a common sense people will know that all people will rush for vaccinated travel lane for all sorts of purpose he should know this issue will happen before implementing the policy i am worried having him leading singapore to fight covid
your tax payer hands that are quick to she had she would blood
with such a high vaccination rate plus booster rate its illogical to still have restrictions they made it look like they are not am not sure of what they are doing
tell united states the plans 人算不如天算
they use all force and regulations to control the spread of covid but the covid case keep infect people every day soon all the people in the world will get infected anyway so why are they keeping use all forces and regulations to stop human freedom if you start to count the infected people from the beginning until now and it look like almost all people in the world already got infected
they need money that why
they are already buried with the highest pay in the world hats obviously corruption
any money cannot bring into the grave pouting face
nowadays why the chicken chicken are not not healthy to eat chicken has been cared well by poultry farmers and government if I am not wrong every three months once vaccine for I improve I immune systems of chicken small doubt thinking face
orange county firefighters service are suing orange county government an attorney for the group filed a motion on oct one asking for an emergency injunction to block the county from requiring employees to submit to unwanted vaccinations employees say they were at first told that they'd be fired if they didn't take the vaccines later the county changed the plan to issuing written reprimands employees said the department would not have been able to provide services properly if there was a sudden loss of five hundred employees about thirty eight percent of the department looks like all those empty threat backfire once people all stand up together
their problem
because singapore govt can only control its own pal not those foreigners who are coming to spend and since riches in singapore do not pay taxes you need to open up for small pal to go back to work pay taxes cps so govt has money to spend or how to pay two million us to each of those officials

dear friends i have gone throw some of your comments already minister is explained why reopening borders with more countries i am going to add a bit every country has to survive with live and livelihood together it cant leave livelihood for a long times the country will be getting permanent disable for long years of shut down the borders that's why need to open more countries for well being and survive singapore not just shut down the border for more years where the truth is that we have to live with covid this truth is not for singapore only it is universal now we have to learn from other countries also how they reconnecting and opening border with other countries and plus note that only vaccinated people are allowed to enter in so as i believe that there is nothing different for the antibody of vaccinated severity between singaporean and other country people is same so why we are getting shock when border opening for vaccinated only if we look to europe we can understand why mtg has decide to reopen is there any of malaysia friend can help to share the timeline that when will be the perfect and suitable time to reopen singapore borders to save life and livelihood we have to reopen in a day isn't it of course to save life is first priority than livelihood also note please there are most of the cases are mild or no symptoms even covid positive because of highly vaccinated and some of people need oxygen supplementation and ice because of severe disease and seniors who hasn't been vaccinated or partially vaccinated few are fully vaccinated currently in singapore
dear maun so now can you explain the logic why restaurant cannot play music but gym can play music so what has music got to do with covid infection

thank you ministers for trying all your best for singaporeans the whole world is badly affected too we are a small country with less resources but we have come thus far really appreciate all the measures taken here thank you sir
the singapore government has finally yielded to allowing sin vac to be accepted as a legitimate vaccine as it acknowledges that there are people who are wary about messenger ram vaccine long term side effect i applaud to singapore governments honesty to deal with this issue based on scientific knowledge and not political considerations
they should also allow in erection india controlled their delta peak using in erection
is not it too late for everything or too soon for something
there is a report of ninety sin vac side effects what say you honesty hah aha

how can you compare a bicycle to the lives of humans judging by the comments seems like no regards for human lives

your arrogant and high handed vaccination strategy is robbing people here the opportunity for natural immunity which is the real immunity and not some toxic substances that need to be boosted every few months
why money
it does not make sense the whole point for reduced social gathering groups and dining in is to reduce human traffic so what reasons can they use to justify bringing more people into the streets of singapore cannot have it one way and contradict it almost immediately
even if they are so desperate to open border stick to the current fourteen days quarantine at facilities we do not need these pal spread the virus at community area travellers are now desperate to get out of their country too especially for work permit between malaysia and singapore they can conveniently make an entry for those travellers from europe and rest of asian countries if they can come here meaning they have the means to pay for it apart from paying insurance rather than put restriction on the citizen and let loose these pal
very easy logic is not singapore policy mostly base on it
did you listen to the whole video foreigners are tested rigorously before they come into so it is now the local community that has more infections livelihoods are at stake now singapore need some tourists to boost the economy
foreigners are tested rigorously before they come into so it is now the local community that has more infections livelihoods are at stake now singapore need some tourists to boost the economy
low i would think having more bodies in our infectious local community means a higher rate of infection vaccinated or not they can still be carriers it just seems kinda counter intuitive to have the community be placed under restriction but have tourist coming in pick a direction and go with it the whole talk about endemic just seems to have gone nowhere the video does not even answer the question on why there are inconsistencies between these policies it just admits that there are inconsistencies and ask united states to live with it maybe if proper planning was in place when this whole thing started then the economy would be in a better place
if you are so good we would not have seen a big spike in cases and burden our healthcare right now hello we are ranked among tops in most infected nation right now stop pretending that we did well compared to other countries no one look behind just open your small eyes and see the present state now

would it come a day where they require everyone to take a booster shot every six months to be considered vaccinated will they force us why personal health is taken by the authority it is scary to be living in a world where you do not have control of your health if you do not take booster you are considered not vaccinated are we going in that direction what about the long term side effects of frequent booster shots who is going to be responsible for the long term effects how come nobody questions

all these daggers and complainers are foot soldiers listen to them and the whole country will perish in no time this is why we need wise leaders such as the current mtg ministers the decisions may not be popular to some but they are made in the interest of the country

i wish to apply the nuremberg trials brake to the whole mtg for foiling the basic nuremberg code

when gov do not mandate the vaccine it shows that you are unsure about the solution you just want everyone to be responsible for their own choices in case of any side consequences and none of the task force will be blamed you have already mandated so many things against our choice why left out this how can you expect the elders to feel confident in you when you are not confident in yourself you are governing with fear of accountability
dear million dollar minister your people knows that you are clueless in what has what is going on despite your manipulation of data to boost your paper thin image the people know who to vote in upcoming be
pap million dollar minister why is it that with more vaccinated in our population there are more hospitalizations deaths and how did mon and most of your doctors conclude that adverse reactions like cardiac arrest strokes cancer diagnosis are not caused by the covid vaccines when they themselves do not even sufficiently know about this new vaccine in the first place
majority of foreign workforce in singapore are from your neighbouring as an countries esp malaysia and philippines yet you are not opening borders from them considering singapore has higher cases per day but you are open with countries such as united kingdom which is now living with covid whats the difference of a vaccinated brit with a vaccinated person in as an the problem with the government is lack of empathy and logic
they should try changing seats three thousand two hundred and forty one four thousand three hundred and twenty one two thousand three hundred and fourteen things might just work
pap has no compassion whatsoever they do not give a damn what ever happens to you
i knew that a long time ago
one hundred and ninety eight thousand talking like a kid
one hundred and ninety eight thousand consider yourself ban soon kid
one hundred and ninety eight thousand they do not have to agree with me people have their own opinion
kerr latin cross amen latin cross
there's one thing that i still do not understand for a long time before sep our case nos were very low in double digits then the govt announced living with covid and suddenly our cases spiked to four digits but if you look at the imported cases they still remain very low in double digits even till today so malaysia question is where did all these new local cases originate from did our testing fail to detect infected persons coming in at the border or did we detect them but still let them loose onto the population assuming that since we are of varied that nothing bad will happen or more sinister did mon deliberately massage the numbers of imported cases into local cases with justification that they are prs returning from overseas bear in mind that throughout this time our social restrictions have never eased in fact they were tightened significantly this is a big logic gap that the govt narrative so far has failed to address
the cases spiked when they gave vaccinated pal false confidence it started since nip list august where discrImination towards untaxed started vaccinated pal have quietly been super silent spreaders I am pissed at their mistakes every I a me it has caused both malaysia parents to be at hospital now
it is malaysia twenty years experience so take this thing seriously the doctors will never recommend you this thing because they dons get ready to do so i have lived the hell of pneumonia and inflammation so far and the doctors prescribed me only things those were antibiotic they prescribed me more strong antibiotics when the first one stopped working when all the antibiotics stopped working i had no way but controlling malaysia eating habits to control the severe inflammation and excessive mucus problems because ayurveda described this thing it is a natural thing to treat pneumonia and inflammation with no side effects
because singapore looks up to the gwen to what united kingdom and united states are doing must be scientifically proven and correct
all the sarong party girls like the weill i have never seen such obsequious behaviour of these women when they are in the company of these we los
if singapore is considered by united states a germany as the place with the highest risk rating it is foolish a naive to open up travel to countries with lower risk than singapore it is prudent to lower singapore risk rating before opening up travel if using the criteria of allowing travel from lower risk countries
the four reliance taught by the buddha by proving useful and beneficial in your life
its a choice not mandatory why suddenly sound not a part of citizen anymore its a choice to take other jab as well even before covid appear does tat mean as long whoever din take any jab will have to bear every cost on own even the gov had taken aside cps contributions taxes etc from every citizen so have you taken every single jab tat is a available in the world or in so again vaccination is a choice it should not get any discrimination unfairness or punishment to bear cost etc at all its only a failure that the gov or the world failed to convince those not getting vac trust is involve
pap do not respect human rights they are big bully
how did they bully you and took away your human rights strange to see you still posting here mentioning their name and accusing them with no evidence
covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant
old crab stories nobody fish
frankly speaking cap adam team does enjoy the comedy
just want to have a meal with malaysia family of a simple
why cannot have meals at home
scientists are now advising united kingdom government to make preparations to reintroduce restrictions as infections climb to over of of a daily coupled with the new delta plus mutant germany reports of increase in infections which is said to be the eth wave
the answer to the title is simple money specifically money for the government the government is basically saying to everyone else remind me why we pay the government so much in salaries and benefits again
i heard all opposition parties so want this kind of salaries him than wants we must blame opposition for being greedy too
high vaccination rate coupled with high infection rate but you opt not to choose targeted policies instead penalise the entire workforce just to get your numbers up
are you ready to migrate or running for next be
this is about growing the gap right
any open back to normal la why still try to act like you have control when already loss control leave it to nature better
it was said vaccination stop the virus why in the west virus still occurring that is meaning vaccine does not works
egg wat rubbish of was still the best
you say now singapore got more infection but other country has less infection rates so you allow them to come in this sounds like we are a very selfish country we only think about ourself
you use bicycle to compare to the situation what a joke then i would say the tourist are lubricant oil more oil comes in to our road all cyclist will not be safe even with the brake and will slip and fall
just here to dislike not here to listen to him talk crap cannot make up their mind as usual lock down then indirectly force everyone to get vaccinated now vaccinated cannot even go to the mall is so damn ridiculous honestly king joke
singapore Singapore now saturday twenty three october two thousand and twenty one
i cannot wait to vote you out coming election
and you have been crying ever since you started voting
well played of oct singapore opening borders to india
extend restriction to welcome import cases face with tears of joy
pap or generation finish already too long already or brain become rusty
i cannot understand why political leaders in singapore talk like this bicycle going downhill the western political leaders do not talk like this because their electorate will feel insulted with this condescending manner of speech
its to cater to the people who voted for them most of which are uneducated and only vote for them by of sky
time to leave malaysia beloved country person shrugging medium light skin tone male sign

this guy can really sleep well at night with so many deaths everyday
I am not sure if they can really sleep well at night but i pretty sure that i cannot sleep well if i have no a a cannot even pay off of bills
evil demon like this guy can sleep very well because he is bored from the devil
frankly wrong terminology to use the word brakes just like pm said we must respect the virus why not the virus respects united states in fact all overseas visitors must be quarantined as you cannot tell if they are asymptomatic i read about cases in the past developed symptoms half way through the quarantine even though tested negative initially not from only one batch but several batches
by fencing up hawker center allowing only two openings do you know your brake causes people jamming these two openings causing human traffic jam no more social distancing
i hope there is no breakout of fire in the shopping malls if it does big problem for people to escape
they are worshipping the virus
geez man it is against nature i really wonder whether he knows anything about the cars cove virus and in particular the delta variant and all its of a sub lineages and why this particular variant has become the dominant variant now
talk again these in blob three stooges just look at their stupid faces youtube got better stuff let me give you a thumbs down can
living with no of deaths due to covid quite sad and unfortunate for such norm
life is short good deeds are the real bank account for united states there will be a judgement day for everyone at least i can sleep in peace every night here the
when is this when everyone has contracted covid
it simply means covid will be around but cases will ease once we have better immunity try to read some world news to understand
of course with the majority of united states infected with covid singapore achieves herd immunity the results are the same as without a minister in charge so why do we need minister on
china why do we need chiao eng china rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
they are confused and are undecided
they are not confused if they are they will not have the political courage to pull back to dine for two and ban the vaccinated from the malls and hawker centres these are hard decisions soft politicians will not make such decisions
masks to work these sick bastards have sold this country to pfizer
causing distress for family why stress without maids
soon few will have more gathering with few think sea will go out from comfort zone like air on mall shady places to check on these pal at interchange and parks face with tears of joy
yeah fresh meat from pm
blab blab blab like living in planet blab no new info except cut a paste from who directives
honestly there are only two questions to answer the rest is just moot
as usual the of pigs only know pub smart move oak
stop talking law minister on no one will call you a mute if you keep your mouth shut
everything got excuses
is this the same clown that extended covid restrictions to nov of of why he open boarders
he needs it for his family real estate business
twenty oct of pap let us open our boarders
and the worst part lets open to south asia malaysia and indonesia
kerr even india bangladesh vietnam what an opening of border what a joke
india is doing waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy better than singapore at the moment by the way cases have been steadily declining for the last three months and a big part of the population is vaccinated too
my on i do not like your speech you addressed pro a correctly you are high in position while pro a lower pro a address you accordingly but you please treat the professional with respect
sad to see no one is appreciating these hardworking dedicated people crying face
its the poor civil servants and workers
fully vaccinated can still be infected and can still transmit to others so why is it safer to allow only fully vaccinated foreigners into singapore
face with tears of joy
open up travellers to six more countries exponential rise in cases clusters a deaths after nip muppet logic
chances of them transmitting is lower is it not
they bring money its all about money money money
boy if they are infected there is no or lesser symptoms in no sign or warning you cant even tell making them super spreaders that's the reason why the more you vaccinate the more cases there are now out of control
boy no not lower
in maybe gov hope vaccinated less chance of falling serious I shall I will to the point of dying and have utilise our overloaded hospital otherwise they just recover at home
the via cash depleting and europe airports force asia airlines including via to start flying there or loose the landing slot there we go person shrugging hospital capacity should follow up to be able to handle the increase cases accordingly to wrong plan
open up for money law singapore so small no money all die I am sure singapore reserve all paper number maybe inside a person shrugging light skin tone female sign
tell the one talking about chinese privilege rats steal things from others and spread ceca variants
we have a very careless peoples action party minister who handled the covid of case unprofessional before he open the boarder he never thinks the hospital is capable to handler huge local covid of patient they are good for nothing they are not capable of judging the future out come and safety of singaporean i think prime minister pick them from scrap yard none of them is professional we vote them in to control our freedom they created problem and want united states to follow the instruction they cant see and predict far what will happen like our pm lee juan yew i don't think they don't even have a experience of good old retire minister
his argument is flawed the vaccinated travel lane only started this week excluding germany brunei of course the imported cases are still low but give it time the imported cases will rise and spread to the community and singaporeans who have been following the rules are the ones who suffer plus be consistent in your policies if borders are open then singaporeans should be allowed to gather in groups of more than a there's currently one standard for the rich and expats they can afford to travel with families and return without quarantine and another standard for average singaporeans
now our cases are high if they dare to come let them come la what is the big deal
coon big deal because they keep talking about hospital and ice being overwhelmed right now these people coming in will contribute to the community spread perhaps we will hit five thousand to seven thousand cases a day which means more people will end up in the hospitals and ice they will use this excuse to introduce more restrictions who suffers in the end ordinary singaporeans like us
open border for outside countries with delta virus and not open border with malaysia pure game with singaporeans
minister on minister on where do i start you are easing up border restrictions to reduce the labour shortage for construction projects right now the dorms are also facing rising cases are you ensuring we have sufficient and appropriate facilities to house these migrant workers plus do not let there be a ord fiasco
write so much for what face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy if you are really so good you should be in the hospital making decisions rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing thumbs up
yawning face yawn tiring the long and winding road that leads
hmm i wonder what your true intentions are you are not helping the government you are making it worse for them mocking our concerns comments are you truly a supporter of government or intentionally trying to turn people against them
wonder why cases skyrocketed after of of the population are vaccinated the truth is vaccine is the virus
why dine in only allow two but open border no answer
hello for people to enter the country there is a need to show per result prior to arrival for dine in do you do per result before eating which is of a higher risk
chang how effective is the per travellers from some of these countries are bold enough not to wear mask in their homeland what make you think they are safe to come face with tears of joy
flip flop with this policies open close open close immunity decrease by the time you reopen immunity of a recovered patient is a the bubble you making did not work does not work and will not work or strategy has no logic you are just selling fairy tales if this is six to eight ratio how you compare it with flu you say six months state that you all will resign if this turns to be a lie like everything else i said or a fail like everything you did so far solution go europe or united states where life is back
why divide sporrans vaccinated vaccinated into north and south korea man propose god dispose

there are simply too many comments that are out to destabilise this yet all the negative comments are finger pointing at the authorities this is the new singapore
by opening earlier before the clusters were subdued you guys should have known cases will balloon out of control and as a result more people will die why the rush for economic benefit but at what cost while people can accept there will be deaths it could have been reduced if you controlled those clusters first before opening rather than back track and semi lock down again and give all kinds of analogies or excuses after the damage done and hospitals having capacity issues your main priority is to look out for the well being of the people of this country done lose track on why you are in government in the first place

what is the vaccination earliest date as cut off are we allowing pal in
its clear their endemic stay with covid had failed and singapore is back with more restriction now is damage control nothing wrong to admit mistakes instead of blaming and discriminate unix
about time for the in tax to be automatic
just ignore thor a was two myths fake account spewing pile of poo pile of poo pile of poo
a have to discriminate against the vaccinated because they are taking up hospital resources
vaccine mandate is a dark global agenda you are naive to think that the vaccine differentiation is a domestic decision blame game
nothing says about these restrictions hama
king they have their legitimate reason and they pay taxes too even unix that had survive covid had better immunity than tax there are people that had medical reason too you are one narrow minded person
i they claim endemic but sire they failed to later implement more restriction
there nothing to be painful when one had done no wrong its the person that create bad karma that will eventually be painful when the time comes
yes to be expected there are many carrier

zero blame less may be helpful to you
what if one of the deaths was you sure i will tell your parents to blame less
you cannot get a decent job outside why resort to shilling as a peoples action party in for a pittance is that how you bring food to the table
one and stop thinking that you have liberty to post all the falsehoods like you could in to
liar to is not malaysia cup of tea la no wonder or world is so small can prove you are able get a decent job other than a shameless peoples action party in tasked to patrol get sites cannot right
if you are not am not careful all end up like that changeling peoples action party in nikon odeon who ken recalled to the kennel
zero lee he does not need to step down as he will see his father in the with level hell soon
are you sure that it is of to report death everyday only you and the peoples action party are of with it but not we please next time think first when you write in the post that is not the way to support the peoples action party by saying it is of with the death number compare with the other country peoples action party supporter nowadays really low standard this type of comment you can write it are you a representative for pap
talk be fair in your comment please
i had said what you have said you really look like your supporter deny things that have said from their mouth
wow you really look like the person who like to brat about himself for applying good strategy on covid of
talk i guess that the difference between us your profile name shows a lot of your intentions
come on tell united states the truth about vol tell united states which companies countries have lobbied for reopening the government is willing to do this despite rising number of cases everyday and at the expense of your healthcare workers we should at least know who is going to benefit from this and please stop saying that your measures are there to relieve stress on the healthcare system because they clearly areas amazing how someone can say this with such conviction on national television then go on and do something totally opposite what a politician
err the six new south asia countries added like will have only workers and students coming in if they confident to bring more worker ease restriction for united states also
and openly tell united states they've invested in pfizer if this isn't conflict of interest what is how many ministers have stocks in pfizer declare law
zany should be tease or pic has shares in order to secure the vaccine supply for so so we can get it before other countries which we did other countries gov also invested in vaccine companies the vaccine is not that useful is another matter do not think any ministers personally have share in pm like you mention that would be conflict of interest pocketing profit from this person gesturing no person gesturing no female sign person gesturing no male sign
put bloom berg already announced tease has invested now who'd know if respective individuals wouldn't be tempted to make a good buck from this ism not saying they are but if they did citizen lives would appear so so cheap if its not already
zany sigh they all from good school should know what is right what is wrong maybe we do need to worry so much i am hoping wrong beef up the hospital capacity since now gate open maybe increase in cases later on
put yeah we iran bills only can only hope for the best of humanity

wow all scammers come together allow me to report all of you to the authorities better upgrade your firewall
in singapore virus start to slowly disappear why they suddenly virus so much we are just a small island with sea on all sides
because we eat with five people instead of two
did you flip flatbread on this last time you say not due to this reason person shrugging now you say is due to this
so run by puppet master a his puppets
warped logic
go back to bounty hunting please do not complain so much
hama they are deaf i think
it is simple actually when you use your logic people who goes to a gym is of a healthy people while people who goes to a restaurant are not
one is enjoying the other is suffering cannot than just close restaurants and open gyms so simple why be so entitled if you so smart why not join pap
i am bounty hunting for fairness and its a constructive feedback and not complaint cos gym is a place to workout quietly during pandemic with no music and shouting are required cos its not singing or dancing competition
tim feb hawker and all food outlet us are daily essential cos people need to eat and its considerable to play light music to soothe the atmosphere while gym seems non essential for the general public especially for the kids and elderly also anyone can workout at home with own music played on or do it outdoor while enjoy the bird singing in the nature so let us be logical about what people really need essentially during this pandemic crisis
feet sorry but when did hawker centre have music soothing music is used to charge high prices for atmosphere which is not essential as most singaporean cannot afford those at as places
tim many fast food outlets have played music or radio station through speaker so this outlets at as is it
feet a sure as restaurants are non essential best is to close shop and open fast food restaurant and play radio if you think you can rather than sulking in social media
tim its not about sulking or fretting on social media but its all about giving a constructive feedback on how to lay out a concrete measures that are seamless and simple to all to understand cos music makes the people come together but food makes everyone come closer to civilisation
feet obviously this pandemic they do not want people to come together they want people to reduce interaction work from home restrict group size and having soft music in at as food places only makes people stay longer even to is banned do not compare apples and oranges
tim then do not compare durian with chem peak cos simply if do not want people to come together then why there are rallies and award variety shows and parade and also millions of people commuting on public transport and above of population living in hub and condos and is not that already close enough and tell me now is data kuching and longan are the same
covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from infection or fully vaccinated covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the variant

i am still confused sitting with strangers in a train or bus and yet i cannot sit next to malaysia closest of friends this is utter nonsense
honestly even a preschool kid and elderly are all confused with these inconsistencies measures cos its weird illogical and totally out of this world
thanks a lot sir folded hands
i think many people who self tested art positive will keep quiet if they have no symptoms so these silent infection will not get reported in the daily infection rate
if not seriously I shall I will until needs to go ice they got no time to care also all own self take care own self that wrong home recovery
with the new a a a health protocol you won no test no case what a brilliant mtg
put if not seriously I shall I will and you go hospital you are actually exposing yourself to more infection risks hospitals full of germs
hospital also cannot handle more people now not dying one all home recovery rolling on the floor laughing
keep changing or rules see who die first good job clapping hands
wow banned dining and malls for unix is not enough coming soon on st jan banned from going back to workplaces so how are the citizens of singapore going to survive and live yet they say the vaccine is not mandatory
thanks a lot sir
china cant look to singapore for a way to live with covid of health economist says singapore is experiment to live with the corona virus and its subsequent spike in infections might not be a useful model for china this safety net protecting the health of a a billion people did not come easily we cant let it go just like that i ling from peking university is national school of development
there are already more than of a sub lineages of the delta variants to greet the singaporeans soon the most dangerous are delta end of or delta end of because these mutations can evade the antibodies and the body immune system
we are heading towards on be king becoming pm due to his awesome brownie points these few months
thankfully i have malaysia bags packed and ready to go soon
hmm what happened to the light at the end of the tunnel its not coming
we are expecting a headlight of the coming train
next up on comedy central
vaccine for children how we know it safe wrong
we don't at all they want to cover their asses its time for opposition to show they are better than pap
let children jab you scare dun let them jab also scare sigh another overdosed parents
law wow gov cannot like that say old man like die never mind children how can ska ska they still so young
it is really not in their plan if kids died from the a they will not even blink for a second for them money just take
well singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cold response and harsh restrictions maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity can united states cd places singapore in highest travel risk for cold fox bic looks at situation with migrant worker dorms latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct with
the question is why is he in the task force when he is not a infectious doctor they sound as if they are real doctor
they are stooges
as film director always said have you memorise the script okay take one action face with tears of joy
i will say it will take another year and i believe there is a new variant soon
covid nineteen shown that it is more resistance more mutations of virus hama let us see a new variant
is not what we doing we are doing crazy measure to allow home recovery and let the virus spread in community
i cannot wait for delta plus end of or end of to pay singapore a visit then we will talk
on oct of the bill and melinda gates foundation announced that it would be setting aside one hundred and twenty million dollars to ensure merck experimental corona virus disease two thousand and nineteen covid of drug molnar iraqi is made available to people in lower income nations merck drug is aimed at combating mild to moderate covid of cases no wonder all of a sudden all the mainstream media were boasting about this super pill very powerful background obviously
country run by a bunch of economists all singing from the same hymn meet
if just reading scripts plus use a to speak the scripts
these ministers from which school huh
singaporeans are being experimented with
by mainly economists like law oak pcs
i run a chain of eateries can malaysia companies refuse entry to those to took the chine sum vaccine
i oppose to many of the tvs live and let live heaven got eyes
david to i want them to get it good
not easy but keep on going minister many things could be done better but singaporeans will not realise how lucky we are to have this leadership
this rush to open borders for the south asians malaysia and indonesia is just waiting for another disaster to happen
forgot something its called mutations
yes the health minister is clueless about healthcare the only credibility he has is being in the pap
sea that was during sky times now being in the peoples action party is seen as mercenary
even with four thousand cases a day how long does it take for the stabilisation minister on is talking about if we do the match it will take one thousand days for mil to be infected and have as stated in his speech that is three years not a months whether we ease measures now months later or six months later infections will still rise we either bite the bullet sooner or later unless we are willing to wait years but it is simply not feasible to remain in this semi lock down state for so long we have to move on
what if more than of of somewhere like ask just hope covid death do not spike too much pity the medical workers who have to deal with this
most imp question why do voters like to elect stupid idiots to lead singapore to more deaths
pap have not control a natural disaster like a pandemic like they could singaporeans their schedule might work for forcing singaporeans to adhere to policies but the virus is omnipotent and omnipresent
jesus is coming back to earth to resolve everything repent
hama you better go to heaven
no he has he is not you better do something about it yourself
the eth mass extinction is already in the making coming soon to a theatre near you
dream on your jesus
progressing with more deaths insisting on living with covid is right approach no logic
the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with co laurie acid and total community viral load can be lowered do not play dice with covid try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time
hey you idiots how many more seniors do you want to kill
singapore is young man young blood fresh creative idea country old man old idea old method old car old etc not allowed except politicians zipper mouth face
jun id about a quarter of their population is above of
do not pub when it goes up to ten thousand
hospital capacity do not allow that much cases they can just just report max five thousand no matter what are number the rest do home recovery close one eye have to see daily death cases
any no need so many measure one people still going out mall so crowded everyday queuing so long hama is of no problem many seem like care about those vulnerable but body very honest every day whole family japan japan fill out the mall
if shopping mall no traffic you will needs to bring in even more tourists to shop or all shipping mall close shop what do you want
thank you minister on for your status report on the covid nineteen situation in so it gives united states confidence knowing the task forces thinking in leading united states to become a covid of resilient nation
i hope you have parents and grandparents above of
and children who cannot take the vaccines
they have gone mad
is it one way in singapore only or two ways malaysian can go back malaysia visit family indonesian can travel back indonesia
i was enjoying malaysia wonderful saturday until these four faces suddenly appeared and ruined malaysia saturday

no normalcy will come we will have to be vaccinated every six months for life because that is the agenda and the future vaccines will likely be paid from our med safe the shots will become more and more expensive whether we take the shots or resist them our money will still be deducted this is malaysia theory for what is to come i hope i am wrong
they vex senate you continuously all bible prophecies are coming to pass quickly
i quote him just like the life of a human being it surely end what what has what is important is when and how doctors analyse and can estimate how long and how a person may pass away if there is an adverse medical condition this analysis of the government and rather redundant statements does somehow show we are just waiting for everybody to get infected if that the plan might as well get this over with and forgo all restrictions
of of five I shall I millions I shall I will be seriously I shall I will and require ice bed of I shall I will not make it is the number right worrying
rolling on the floor laughing name family trolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing joke only
open vols so foreigners have privileges but restrictions for citizens source st twenty five oct

another mushroom
benefit to get stronger virus beaming face with smiling eyes
shitty vaccine change malaysia mind
why really because our corrupt officials are looking after their wallets while letting united states die be because of this clowns bad decisions of letting foreigners in throughout the whole process while keeping united states locked in
now lord of brakes and rings to sleeping face sleeping face sleeping face sleeping face sleeping face
were just waiting to die at this point
its all about breaking your spirit and making you fall in line slowly but surely and at a pace that everyone isn't even noticing it compare now to a year ago when we had no deaths and only a fraction of these restrictions the vaccine causes mutations and spread but hey lets get another booster jab for a vaccine which already mutated and doesn't help
wow what an analogy i thought if you have a couple of re bulls ride down fast enough you can
analogy is for stupid people to understand complex problems
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
incompetent and overpaid even an intern can do their job at a of a the pay
really then make it a of of
is it also against nature that germany russia and united kingdom are having a new wave now nature dictates that organisms adapt to survive and covid mutates to survive with every new person it infects living with covid only gives covid a much higher chance to adapt to our current vaccines and antibodies you cant be sure that we will live with of a of a cases a day in the future because it is not happening anywhere else in the world russia united kingdom and germany are showing you your future path
if drive a shared electric car and no wear mask on this spring car is that getting the covid virus who know the past spring drive have virus or not on the road can see a lot mon la need to check it is that were spread the virus went the car no clean up and no wear mask to drive this sharing car
you got your brake on your bicycle but do not have one meter safe distance in all buses and train than you may come out and say whatever you want
try to be clever
you saying right for me covid rule not logic bus art so crowded every morning can see many people touching each other so funny
very hard to be ministers during covid storm folded hand Singapore
you seldom get second to breathe
unfortunately it would be proven to singaporeans their resolve not in handling the crisis but in pleasing their overlord
plus get a better gap in the mtg they a simply asking the public doing businesses to change if you cannot survive try this pandemic but there is no improvement to this gap of people wat should we do
please sack them for the sake of singapore
the majority do not accept a lone voice sharpen the axe
petition god for capable leaders
that is insulting singapore education system
your family will the over a
I am sorry so before you comment think first a
i do not know until you tel me grinning face with smiling eyes
before its was max group of a then group of five fully vaccinated now group of five fully vaccinated from the same household if a rate smaller then a what has what is next booster shot required no more restrictions now
we mass vaccinated tightened restrictions to more than we had over a year ago and we manage to get thousands of daily cases and a dozen daily deaths makes you wonder if the vaccine and restrictions because this there's no other explanation for it
seventy four it follow restrictions anymore as well as a year ago
i would say either make up their minds to properly fight covid or just bloody give up either open up fully or shutdown fully for a good one to three months and clean house then open up to covid safe countries constant flipping and then flopping on your collective peoples action party face is not exactly the way promote confidence in our leaders
seventy four more a more restrictions only show ineffectiveness its a very factual issue
very much agree
jab till you drop the eth eth eth dead
rousseau its gonna be eth eth and subsequently booster shots these of knows what their doing
well singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cold response and harsh restrictions maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity can united states cd places singapore in highest travel risk for cold fox bic looks at situation with migrant worker dorms latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct with
bible prophecies are coming true the mark of the beast is here those who take the vampire juice will meet a fate worse than death
non of these four are health experts they never mentioned the long term health effects due to infections they never mentioned who suggestion on pandemic is still at the highest level
we all know that and ism sure they know but it doesn't change the fact that like it or not the infections will spread
europe against the cold war
you are right the two who talk the most are economist by training just like cotton chan
these are highly educated scholars with proven track record who spent endless time and effort to figure out how to solve this problem which is not easy at all
you still trust who low
kenneth may is the only one with health background but he is being too quiet and ignorant he should resign
the previous doc minister of malaysia said spanish fly how like that grinning face with sweat
zany that's different country which we shaft compare with ours are different top elite scholars with track proven leadership skill they are the most hardworking ministers and singaporeans should rightfully be very grateful
they failed to publicise that singapore govt and plus issued over of mail us in debt ltd of of is less than mobil last year govt running out of money hence the panicked headless chicken approach over the last few months
on low good luck with that
on well said thumbs up thumbs up
was very surprise on knew delta is very transmissible
you probably do not know right
face with tears of joy
is a joke that singapore is so stabilised with high of vac now but all the ord world countries has been stabilised for quite some time and allowing the influx of this it
two brakes need to be applied and for those who want to use the delta variant as an excuse the first case was reported in october of of way before our first vaccination
all the strategies are not working in this stage to break the spreading government should implement two weeks fully locked down followed by another two weeks restriction for example working from home mandatory during restrictions fully one month the nation can overcome this situation
there is no strategy its reacting to various issues without careful thinking and lousy execution i do think lock down is beyond united states now i've always advocated lock down but we need to know how to handle a lock down i don't think the government knows how going by how they screwed up without being tight and maybe that's why they want to open up so that they can find excuses and do not need to handle the groundwork anyway with everybody basically spreading to everybody now the practicalities of a lock down are probably impossible for united states to handle
we mass vaccinated and only now we have thousands of daily cases and a dozen dying each day yeah that cant be caused by the vaccines right i can only say thank you for protecting the vaccinated from the vaccinated i will be refusing any regular nasal testing and if ism not allowed to whf next year its bye job and bye singapore
we have achieved more than of herd immunity but yet we are still dealing with this mess and that confusing
thumbs up
i unable to blame the peoples action party government now i can only blame the of that voted them
minority blaming the majority is normal in this country sorry you suffered
i can only blame the pandemic exist in the world
suffered or not time will tell the mana is eating your organs inside out slowly now no a in the world ranking for most critical cases per of a of a
actually there with votes to ensure they sill stay on top
a happy for them and feel so blessed
do not shill for peoples action party so soon
have you taken your eth eth and eth shot already i will pay for your transport to the clinic the more the merrier boost your immunity in no time
audio other countries want also do not cry law understand your problem

audio of thank you you are better behaved than your flocks i am okay too
next be well see if they will still have of vote
they have made a number of mistakes indeed but to be honest i don't see the opposition doing better or having better solutions as well we need stronger politicians
every wise soul knows how they win the be for decades
audio to man why waste time on trash wastebasket just leave it
come blame me if under of pigs singaporean will extinct bios of covid
coon we a now under paper and we are going extinct now good luck to you

utter failures repeating mistakes with no qualms
complaining compliance

org is this guy capable of telling a single truth this entire speech was a joke even the dumbest of sheep can see through this nonsense
we are really dumb many people cant see through them him and for those who can we have very very short memories and then for the remainder we have not guts please please please let me be wrong

a perhaps our tolerance levels are exceptionally high as compared to other nations it is something like you know you are in a toxic relationship but continuously hope for a change and better days you can see the four stooges are being very careful pushing down policies layer by layer they probably already have a plan if it somehow hits our limit and we begin to retaliate ism curious to see where the limit is
tan when are you leaving singapore please do not tolerate
year why don't i person shrugging male sign
tan after receiving please go
there no truth in him
why don't you drink more water its good for you please drink
stockholm syndrome on a national level sigh pensive face
tan our limit is very high be we have been trained to accept and agree yes we may complain but ultimately aren't we compliant they know this the system the past leaders created made united states this way the ultimate gift to this generation of leaders in the private sector wouldn't they already be up for a performance review and then maybe fired
hoping these people in the comments do a better job than pap i support you
can somebody ask him hard questions
he wont reply he has fudged issues before i remember an opposition my suggesting minimum wage for the lowest paid people and on be king asked who to fund opposition my suggested ministers salary giving a small number of people that would benefit so ministers salary would fund a persons on be king responded saying ministers salary cannot build a primary school what more minimum wage and brushed off the opposition party arrogantly like a victorious debate what has primary schools got to do with the minimum wage and the worse was how he brushed aside the opposition candidate at least this is how i remembered it
he has umbrage issues too huh
cannot because all the reporters and questions have already been are selected and prepared before hands imagine if someone asked an unplanned questions and they cannot trust such press conference more like publicity conference
chomp kate a mock conference hmm

brakes or no brakes the system has already crushed long before you were elected stooge

if not from papers read from where
take both jabs where bobby feet
bobby is here riding a bike down the slope so see you soon down there beaming face with smiling eyes
feet know how to apply brake correctly rolling on the floor laughing
i don't understand why i can literally sit next to dozens of strangers on the art but cannot sit to eat with malaysia family in a restaurant sorry still am confused neutral face
because you take off mask when you eat in art everyone has a mask on
because everyone is wearing a mask on the train while no ones wearing a mask in the restaurant
because you are not talking to them face to face without a mask sharing food that is the key difference hope this helps you to get out of your confused state
i couldn't walk pm down to scott is square to get malaysia groceries or go to guardian had to expose myself to thousands more people by taking the train to to a pay a just to fill a prescription
seventy four was the point of this mag to tell united states you live pm from scott like to be unmasked while walking coz being in public spaces with masked people carries much less risk than being in a restaurant with unmasked people hope this helps your confusion while walking down the orchard belt
if restrict to five people sit in a restaurant it will help to make less travellers in art also
do not operate at the logical level
i also do not need to have one meter safe distance thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face
still some are talking loudly because of their masks in crowded buses
sorry don't understand how do you sit next to dozens of people in art that sounds not right you only sit next to two peoples and its not even as crowded since millions are still whf gosh all these comments are very toxic
mask off in restaurant that is the problem so when will this will ever end
che hock agreed
open up travellers to six more countries exponential rise in cases clusters a deaths after nip muppet logic

then you do not sit in art low stand in art simple
which is more important in preventing covid spread wear mask or wash hands
how dumb can someone be most cases are infected in public and work places even hospital with stricter regulations have been a cluster are these pal not wearing mask when moving around with or without mask anyone can get infected especially in public transport ever heard of the news before or just be ignorant
buy a bentley if you cannot take the public transport low
i still cannot mandatory for vaccination makes more sense
the measures affect everyone vaccinated persons can only hang out in groups of two too mandatory vaccination might not be possible since the vaccines are only approved for emergency pandemic uses
nuremberg code you cannot force or coerce people to inject something without their informed consent the penalty for violating that is death even the ones who are just following orders
these unlawful mandates comes from pfizer the contract is they bought the government that is why you see some countries politicians reading the same script
mad pfizer is not our govt

there are announcements almost every alternate days please think through your strategies and policies before making another announcement
you want them to say one time and that
obviously you are not familiar with the difference between strategies and policies from an update please analyse previous announcements and try to comprehend before making such ignorant statement
go ahead and support this agenda earn that dirty money and watch karma play its part you'd be lucky if you get to see karma face to face

congrats since you on be king took over mon daily cases and deaths have been hitting the roof with a of a new cases and fourteen deaths eight vaccinated and eight not vaccinated on twenty two october two thousand and twenty one yesterday in the meantime the vaccinated are discriminated banned from entry to malls and even hawker centres while the news media biased reports pit the vaccinated against the vaccinated to divide and rule instead of unity to overcome this crisis the only decent thing now you must do is to resign immediately
because they don bother local livelihood only want economy gain must well don down mask for those fully three vaccinated

why nah big brother cannot offend
why singapore opening boarders easy don't see you opening boarders to ord world countries he their currency too small to entice you
is that necessarily wrong though
did not they just announce opening borders to bangladesh pakistan india myanmar etc etc earlier today hardly st world countries
if singapore citizens go out and come back to singapore is not restricted the restrictions only other than singaporean this also will affect the spreading of virus
him think ceca foreign workers working for susana tease all about money so any liability is only its people a national funds expect many tax increase
opening is definitely in line with global order we are not north korea
him so for ceca in so can they go back and visit their family in india and come back or one way in to singapore only did india ban singapore too
him i have had enough of this denigrating attitude towards india and indians historically the term ord world refer to the countries that neither allied with the united states nor with the soviet block by that logic singapore is a ord world country too as it was non aligned maybe you forgot the state of singapore in the is and is the prosperity to singapore came only after it opened up to the world and its advantageous location in the malacca strait in india only a few sectors have been opened up so fare a it and software services yet india is advanced enough to develop nuclear weapons and send satellites to mars and moon india even launched a satellite for singapore as well a few years back if i remember correctly so thumbs down to your snobby attitude
well singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cold response and harsh restrictions maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity can united states cd places singapore in highest travel risk for cold fox bic looks at situation with migrant worker dorms latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct with
i used to call peoples action party politicians talking birds when i started to post comments online fifteen years ago today they are still talking in birds language a a a
are you referring to cock instead of bird to bro or too polite
you can police the people but not the virus the first step towards for progress
singapore of a of a cases two hundred and eighty deaths population a a mil a a a a a
yea thumbs up you are absolutely correct
to begin with they re huge it is likely many have had covid but go went undetected additionally its china they tried to silence doctors who warned about the virus how can you possibly think those numbers are accurate and reflective of the real situation in china
china is big their economy can sustain a prolonged closure because of strong internal demand that why they can afford to do that singapore relies heavily on the rest of the world that why we must open up go back to your pc economics lessons and stop spouting nonsense
i think singapore is a rare developed nation that can screw up so badly be so dumb and yet pat ourselves on our back saying we damn solid and allow people to be infected and die without conscience uniquely singapore
time it takes for china to snuff out an outbreak of covid with strict and intense tracing and testing policy is roughly ten to twelve days precisely like you peoples action party lovers have claimed china is large and singapore larger because its success and agree with the disinformation campaign by western goes and ours take a look at all the social media sources about life in china now or is that too much to expect out of you
a no a united states did the same thing under trump singapore just following the example like a pathetic groupie for the us a economy first people and when people die of covid create excuses and pretend they died due to underlying conditions as though it want exacerbated by covid hence covid because of death but what to do sky was the goat but lee sign long and his cronies are nothing but money grubbing entitled prats
by of
by you are correct china does not need so many foreign workers compared to so
org just open already if you wanna open borders jesus
stay in the middle ground is practical
prefer to lock down and contain the virus from spreading further everyday too many unlink cases
apparently its of to test people entering and exiting singapore but do you think they'll bother testing all the residents i've never been tested and that's perfectly fine because healthy people shouldn't be they purposely test ask people daily to get so many false positives its fudging the statistics the reality is there's only forty sick people a day the of a of others either aren't sick or don't have covid art tests aren't very accurate
soon what a clueless response do you know singapore has hundreds of thousands of flu patients every year and we have eight hundred and fifty five flu related deaths do you see the govt peddling flu vaccines locking down singapore its time to stop listening to media lies
if you open six more countries why local still have all these restrictions what is the purpose
soon still taking about unlinked outdated law
soon basically it other countries also do that already humans lost the covid war
so many elderly die heaven is watching just wait and see
you are being watched
who ask them not to get vaccinated then i feel bad for those who are vaccinated and pass on but if you've no sympathies for them
by you are right do your national duty and get vaccinated unless you have a medical reason
imagine those vaccinated now of of years later if not of cannot get monthly cps life anymore who heat
the four reliance taught by the buddha by proving useful and beneficial in your life
if you know they are of higher risk do themselves a favour by taking tax but of course take tax also might have serious implication if your elderly has underlying medical condition and all kindly ask them to stay at home and avoid exposing themselves to possible exposure
wang i agree with you
man the policies sound good on paper but not in practice
what do you want them to do care to explain
him still long before election comes take care and open or loud mouth less lest the virus slip in
why suddenly add so many countries enough hospital beds or not hello
cannot do nothing
open up travellers to six more countries exponential rise in cases clusters a deaths after nip muppet logic
put the key should be to build capacity to protect the citizenry and close all these travel corridors as we restrict local movements which i also personally subscribe to we cannot allow travellers to walk all over our land in groups this defies logic

axum is it why so many rich people still rush to migrate to this negative country face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
hama they cannot answer this question rolling on the floor laughing
a because of these foolish xenophobia malaysia foreign colleagues now gets good salary increment to renew the contracts loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face businesses who cannot want to work shifts
they probably are too ignorant to understand that xenophobia is bad for spore self entitled brats they are
maybe the rich have a different set of rules

please have early election that the best brake singaporeans will apply
losers patting each other backs pathetic to see
him only brain damage do not vote pap
coon life is good when we have a good govt these people are probably forgetful or ungrateful
if do not vote for pap vote for who cockle
hah aha the cockle of sen gang
if all vaccines are free of charge then the virus will automatically disappeared if the requirement of vaccines still in big demand the mutated new virus will increase again who should announce all vaccines should be free of charge then we will see covid new cases drop super fast
of course la you bring this guy in to increase the infection rate then say that the border control no longer relevant you own self make the situation own self congratulate yourself for the outcome this guy is a load of a
opening of borders to vaccinated persons to singapore via vaccinated travel lane or other avenues need strict controls on the parts test results certifications many countries such parts certificates can be falsified or even bought such singapore milf mon has ice consider setting up singapore per tests operated by singaporeans at strategic locations embassies to effectively stamp out false per certifications
pecos the incubation period of delta is four days if a foreigner takes a are departure test and test negative and arrives in spore on the and ord day and again test negative on the arrival test he can still test positive after the eth day when he is singapore
of a unfortunately for us we have naysayers like you its a shame
instead discriminating between vaccinated or vaccinated individuals why not use art results for imposing restrictions if everyone outside is negative infections will drop for sure
i have a friend who had drug allergy he had his st vaccine on ten july a and on ten aug guess what till today he has been having pain everywhere consulting doc after doc no one can give him a answer the severity of the pain he is suffering till today in this three over myths maybe only about ten days he is fit to walk about freely the rest of the time even walking a five steps to the toilet he needs a walker or walking stick his neighbour who had lead a healthy lifestyle without underlying condition on ord oct sunday had his booster shot and passed away on eth oct tuesday collapsed a died at work suddenly leaving behind two young children hair sad
have heard so many cases like these
and also just a part of the a a harsh but it is what it is to them
tan a a of five millions is ask half might not make it worrying did he update about the five hundred ice beds person facepalmingperson face palming female sign person face palming male sign what happen to the extra ice beds are they there
put i miss the good of days when there was zero vaccination with half the death rate now i also thought newer variants supposed to be less deadly and more transmissible
i he friends too feeling unwell for months though not so serious all these a not open data in sep a they don't follow up as proactively as the west we see some nordic nations stop using modern recently but news reporting here does not go into detail why

follow the money
we just want a safe singapore please don't be money minded
see thailand pal was so hit hard by the lock down and suicide rates increases significantly need to find a middle ground to tackle this problem
you lang you are right find the middle ground and adjust as we move along
unfortunately that kind of how capitalism works
you lang because thailand is deeply depending on international tourism of of its gap came from the tourism industry before the pandemic and it creates eight million jobs singapore is not the case
singapore public debt is higher than average they have to care more about money
else how to pay most expensive pm on the planet a of of annul to mayors for dunno doing what
him i sun really say that but is set aside partisan politics and bring in locals like prof tab yah an infectious expert and tap on this local talent google his a points suggestions to fight covid the of can stay to helm the fight but listen to real medically trained and qualified infectious disease experts while local movements restriction is acceptable opening travel corridors to let in travellers to walk all over the land defies logic how does that help other than boost gap growth
limit will ask more people to vote for them
suwanee you do not care about money very nice man
low are you fluent in english singapore had debts they have to care for economy first before getting bankrupted like china without electricity
suwanee just give them a thumbs down and ignore these kind they want your attention
aida if lock down you will say another thing never trust of pigs
suwanee sorry for not they is majority including of pigs care about money

coon never enough and do not even know what they want
he only cares for money but not caring for peoples lives
us and europe has opened up for quite some time singapore is a hub for businesses if continues to stay lock down the world will find another hub
this guys think we have the monopoly to be a hub foolish to the core
peng we done every country strategies to bypass singapore as a hub and eat our lunch if we still live in our comfort zone the world just moves on without us
most people here think its a god given privilege
from tunnel to bicycle trying very hard to hide those lies
use the same analogy that every six person is someone that knows united states how lame infection will go up or now depend on the evolution of the virus if you want to talk about nature when environment safe it multiplies and if it is hostile it try to gain immortality to ensure it does not dies opening borders is because it is money and the same nonsense on control as they are so many cases caught for people who are totally vaccinated that come here and we find they are infected and we place they in health care at singaporean expenses
all those fanciful hollow words that hold no water wake up
to your
of course when everyone gets infected and nothing left to infect
shall we start finding some shells to hide underneath them
stay with covid and live with covid
is called herd immunity for a reason
cat hear many time rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
this point is correct though forever might be days or years is nothing two infect also assuming no new viruses which is unlikely till then vaccinated ones may no longer be organic enough to survive hence continue changeling funds to biotech good idea fez profit
him you can do better
cat that's not what he means it just means your body is immunity increases nothing is always of a not even chicken pox friends
not sure where he get the evidence of no transmission last forever from should go back make kay toast
you forget indian delta variant spike now united kingdom variant had not come yet
genuine question does anybody know if i get covid and survived can i submit malaysia covid survival to have malaysia trace together status updated to or do i still have to take the vaccine still barred from malls i get covid i quarantine i go to doctor to get certified on paper that i have covid then take the paperwork to submit to a to green light me on trace together can this be done
i cannot find the answer online or on the government websites does anyone know
trees very good point but don't think that's their objective commonsense a highly penalised hence more rare these days low
even with full vaccination fatality rate of elderly and those who underlying health conditions are pretty high
trees natural immunity is not recognise in singapore
five thousand eight hundred and sixty four you have links to singapore government websites to show their official stance i want to document it and screen cap it
trees there int this means there no recognition its all about and control not logic
chen and the excuse is
david to if so can anyone tell me that the of those who are above mayo and not underlying any health conditions
must have gotten the blessing of traitor pm lee he
respect covid open the gates to foreigners but lock your citizens at home

how many death we need loll what brake what rubbish
open means there will be deaths go hide in a hole
we applied vaccines applied the brakes and only then did we see a massive increase in cases and deaths we have more restrictions now than we had over a year ago

tan did not you hear the rest of the speeches
everything also roth pratt one not the first time
only give statement like this if you re very confident the situation would be as per what you mention
first is those people who likes to start arguments
cha you must at least try to be united is not it why be that cynical
if you have a valid point to share do it not like what these typical whiners are doing
he keep changing his numbers the first number was of a cases will stabilise then up to of followed by three thousand two hundred and of after that date not give any numbers and talk gibberish
alan is he god or you are now playing god doing the judgement
sometimes a decision announced is actually decided by a team working behind but only the ones who announced it get attacked
at least have the decency to apologise that he made a mistake instead every time he act like he is right when he is obviously wrong as the health minister he has to make sure that it is kept under control instead of trying to give excuses otherwise why do we need a health minister
when have you become so obedient and naive to believe this
augusta team members is selected by him a others too he is representing all of them a given the national resource to do his duties therefore being this channel beta the gov a its people i don't think you can complain if pal fire at him too bad observing his style in this speech to his past ones much less emotion less genuine as if he is doing something unlike his style limo he is one of the few truly working minister left in sep too bad he has to work in the team
open up travellers to six more countries exponential rise in cases clusters a deaths after nip muppet logic
yeah right stabilisation to them the definition of stabilise means exponential rise

the measures will bring down the age of the covid nineteen deceased as time goes by
he do you know the average age of death from covid is of until this month covid wouldn't have even made the top causes of death in singapore now ask yourself why the sudden surge in cases and deaths when all weave done is mass vaccinate peaked on national day and actually tightened restrictions over of of our covid deaths are from this month alone
seventy four he the youngest fully vaccinated person to die went to a forty one years old person
sultan yeah but he was reportedly partially vaccinated

does it mean that in future when our community cases are lesser than those vaccinated travel lane countries we would have blocked their entries
full of craps from incompetents
answer be because they are dumb and doesn't under delta plus well and insist people to vaccinated when they cant and wont reasons for dumb jacks a underlying illness fear cannot survive vaccine a does not believe vaccine because many infected a never ending boosters so saying indirectly if not vaccinated no job so have you thought about sixty to ninety nine years cleaners etc no job you gonna give them a of a a month i hope they survive to next election i expect some nice fireworks

spot on very precise information thumbs up
approximately only three hundred children out of seventy three million worldwide have died of covid if you have every job offered to you you can still catch it and still pass it on so we have to ask ourselves why this urgency worldwide to jab everybody of all ages with something that does not give immunity since when did it become a crime to have a different opinion since when did the opposition parties in every country stop opposing
why not use australian coax of vaccine
revealed how pfizer blackmails countries for shots
we are want very seriously faster open the singapore border boys lot of people need going to singapore working for there i hope very open singapore border heart suit heart suit heart suit heart suit face blowing a kiss from bangladesh folded hand folded hand folded hands

absolutely
just pray one is not part of the death stats face with steam from nose
part of the depopulation plan
what do you actually fear opening up stop that blame culture please
no fear but just want to clarify as government make it sound like vaccinated people will not spread and catch the virus
face whats scarier is people actually believe the nonsensical statistics you just provided honestly if you really hate the vaccine just don't get it then when you get sick just make sure you don't spread it to others or burden our healthcare system as a result of your ignorance
don't try and use logic because the ministers are void of it this is not about health or science or facts its about following the orders they were given from the puppeteers higher up

axum stop watching fake news media the per test was not designed to test for covid as if you have flu you be tested positive too even not exactly covid but they will claim your covid positive any scientific evidence of isolation of the covid virus yet you seen
when is novara available in singapore
apparently australian made coax of is same as novara and had been approved in some countries
kwan first of all coax is not a vaccine but an vaccine alliance next novara want made by australia australia only buy novara this year and originally supposed to ship to australia in mid of of but delay thus now they are expecting novara to arrive in australia in nov of of upon arrival also need to be tested before australia will use on their people
star here the interview of the creator of coax of he can explain all
kwan the australia made vaccine is not novara its apple is mango just like pfizer is modena tho both are mana but they are not exactly the same thing
kwan i do not know if i can wait until its finally approved by singapore government to be included into the national vaccination programme where if there are side effects after the vaccination i will be protected i have medical condition so i definitely need something that is in the national programme else i scare i cannot afford to pay for any further treatment if i have side effects
kwan thanks for the link i will watch it and try to understand it more
star and good luck with that as they will already be of vaccinated by then low still who wants to take it when no longer term testing down definitely not the a that are already refusing to be experimented on
this is not a case of pick the least poisonous poison to take just to satisfy the governments mandates people will still refuse to be experimented on there's been zero long term testing done on any of them and the risks far outweigh the so called benefits covid is still primarily an issue for anyone with multiple comoros cities which is mostly the very elderly hence why the average age of death is of why should young healthy people bother taking an experimental drug
seventy four hello if you do not be restricted from entering mall to do malaysia grocery shopping or freaking just buy takeaway from a mall and if i catch covid you will pay for malaysia medical fee
seventy four if you do not anyhow assume those vaccinated got people with health conditions so cannot get yet some just got cancer treatment or kidney transplant so only can get vaccination after their treatment as those requires them to take medication to suppress their own immune system those normal healthy people can do not get they will not die but if i ken there is a super high chance i may die

its of better than our country singapore beautiful clean system even drain water can drink
the hammer of gods drive our ships to new land singapore
I am very happy to hear this lots of thanks to singapore
vaccines and lock down do not work unless unhealthy over of all bollocks
i think they did the right thing because the risk is still high
are you sure the case is so high
two shots of pfizer only offers very healthy persons of chance to become very very I shall I will and result to death fully vaccinated persons have a protection after a months do not trust these taskforce lies and deceptions
nothing they have done is right since day one you are definitely fast asleep
amazing grace and another thing its really astonishing to see the rise of millions of pandemic and economic experts in the span of two yrs in the form of keyboard warriors amazing stuff clapping hands
the next country of free entry to singapore probably will be india our government always put them ahead of singaporean they just cannot wait to do just that
you mention singapore has classified taiwan as singapore only recognizes taiwan as a part of china
please open with india also for fully vaccinated people with quarantine measures
india us brazil and malaysia where else do you want to go tell me
ice cases should go up come on covid you can do it
australia please we already paid the of a of a vaccine price for vol
where malaysia when we can go back home cheat everyday a lot of lorry drivers enter spore a go back again to malaysia no quarantine no noting how come they can a we cant pouting face outing face
will the control change again
this entire video could have been a text document
it could be a slide with five bullet points
a load of propaganda lies making money a inflicting fear
use virtual reality to a safe convenient and cheaper than actually travelling low
vol is not as simple as you think on surface it looks good there are still many underlying restrictions like if you fail the are departure test for example in germany you can only leave for singapore twenty one days if you pass the test after st diagnosis of covid when you are back to singapore you can self isolate in your hub flat room if your other occupants have the same travel history as you otherwise you can only self isolate in your hub flat room with an in suite toilet or if you don't have then must seek for alternative accommodation like approved hotels facilities
which are insurance companies that offer travel insurance with coverage on covid related illnesses especially overseas hospitalization expenses
travel to go see a world full of vaccinated zombies I had I would rather stay at home
its all in your head
i think most of united states are waiting for malaysia and data rolling on the floor laughing
nah bro face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
people should just learn to comprehend what endemic means once you have the vaccine worse case you just sick at home for most people they may be like a normal sick person walking around a bit sick and still go work
endemic has certain conditions one of them is herd immunity and agreement among nation do not think we have reach that criteria yet have we achieve herd immunity do we see a decrease of daily infected some countries still on locked down and closing border
why south china morning post video reporting design
why you do this to us now we like india
hope to travel soon
travel burst close again then next year open then close open close no ending
more virus coming in to singapore person facepalmingperson face palming be prepared singaporean be safe soon singapore will be like india
do not worry too much we have to stay open and keep our connectivity with the world have faith
so the ministers decided to sacrifice singaporean citizens life and health to allow travel between these countries without quarantine which honestly is just as risky despite their mentioned frequent covid test do their homework virus is designed such a way that they spread most effectively when they have not developed symptoms which is also when they have not developed enough antibodies to be tested positive we must hold the leaders accountable if mishap happen and endanger our own love ones such as our own children parents and grandparents suggest they don't play with science because they cannot afford that as this will result in first in history singaporean blaming on them
government need money money bag money bag money bag so open borders that why they keep asking pal to go for vaccines soon singapore cases will go up and up person facepalmingperson facepalmingperson face palming because of the government
this is under vaccinated travel pass only vaccinated travellers are allowed and they have to do per test before departure to singapore and on arrival after three and seven days in singapore also need to do per tests at clinic
to denmark do not need quarantine is true what about back from denmark to singapore
india when

i am poor no money to travel how

from today onward anybody who plans to fly oversea for holiday malaysia advice to you is you better think twice if i am not mistaken a has four pilots died after full shots and jet blue in united states has five pilots died due to blood clots after full vaccination long ago up till today how many more i do not know so before you on board the flight make sure you check out whether the pilot had taken the full jabs you better be prepared psychologically that the flight can drop down from the sky like a rock anytime if the pilot suddenly suffer from a stroke due to blood clots this is a new normal happy holiday
the fact that you created a burner acc just to support the irrelevant orange man invalidates you completely no ones go a belief your crap about planes falling out of the sky malaysia dear each plane has two pilot and is driven mostly on autopilot go back to worshipping that orange head of yours
a autopilot does not need man to watch or control you idiot the plane can fly by itself
I had I would assume you live with patrick but yes planes can fly themselves low windblown or have you discovered fire yet
no jab no quarantine no mask no fly i free in home even can drink beer
denmark with of fully vaccinated is this even true is it not less than of vaccinated in denmark is it not denmark already abolished all corona measures and will be official coming october st is it not denmark will go back to old normal with no mask no testing no discrimination to the varied and unix which news should we believe in mainstream news or alternative news as for me i already made malaysia choice and believe its the right one victory hand
honestly i would trust denmark because if jarlsberg did vaccines its probably the best in the world
wanna see more brown faces soon
taiwan has the riskiest vaccination blunder
ism shock that our government is thinking about america at all highest infectious in the world their constant disobedience toward mask wearing
united states of america america is a whole continent
a yes united states alone has highest infection obviously daniel is referring to united states when he said america
the government has their reason so let united states not say anything about it yet
we must remember that there are five thousand american companies here they bring a lot of jobs here the owners and their members have to travel for business and personal matters there should be no surprise
and their stupid republicans trumps supporters kick
a who the of care about the world map lesson right now
freedom few keep wearing your mask slave smiling face with sunglasses
malaysia when
with the current infection rate new government just formed it will be of of

next year they change government
mobile next year change again grinning face with smiling eye grinning face with smiling eye grinning face with smiling eyes like that must extend liao low
why germany when their covid is still so serious red question mark
when is china still not recognise sin vac china is one of the best control in the whole world not to forget china is also the highest in worlds population
strange that singapore consider american the china being the lowest infectious rate now truly political at play disappointing if it happen that they allow american to come in freely
who believe at china numbers at least not me
what about spain one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and cases going down every day
if see it as endemic they should just reopen border to all if not that mean talk bird only
when we know our government just wants money
young i agree this is an inevitable decision for spore soon or later they have to re open their border
staying at home and blame government did not supply for your foods and goods is very bitter way to live
then you do not want money is it
of but be extra vigilant with high risk travels from countries like us india and brazil preferably rule these places out entirely for another year or two
thailand please cannot to eat all the delicious and cheap thai foods and see all their beautiful women low
golden mile can do all that
him his not contagious like covid
its time to reopen change must regain the crown from qatar look at how the closure affects planes need to start flying airlines cannot continue to bleed especially the national carrier covid is a normality if you die its just times up otherwise you will survive
yes i agree nothing much we can do at this rate all must be prepared to get covid and hope can survive so many are calling for another lock down but its not sustainable
qatar hosting a world cup they allegedly bribed their way to win rights to perfect timing to win airport of the year right before the world cup get malaysia point
i have been to qatar airport honestly it does not live up to no one i still prefer change airport
i agree its a never ending story
waiting for boarder open to india praying every day hope singapore gov doing good control measures and at end of the year will go slow and study
sims town boss no for me also when our we get vaccinated and at least on safety precautions release batch by batch
when both spore and two relax the restrictions it'll be a gigantic explosion of tourist into two sporran will die die go two be is near no covid discrimination affordable night markets lockup for too long already must go at all because and cost a data pow some unreported and undetected variant home
i wants to go taiwan plus he a vaccinated lane to taiwan
taiwan has trouble for finding vaccine source thank to mainland china cup
our cases are going up again one hundred and eighty today what make you so sure other countries are assured a confident of our covid fight success they may think we a a danger instead a small island seven hundred so pm a a million population people to people proximity is densely closed a covid cases in the hundred never mind of vaccinated we may think we do well but other countries may think otherwise
when people from other country ask us we tell them we already standing on of fully vac so just open up already and stop giving united states any excuse my yamaha
cannot wait to go canada to see malaysia spouse
booked tickets hopefully cases are kept in check and reopening does not get postponed beautiful british columbia remember to get travel insurance that covers covid tue income is a good choice
cannot wait to go wuhan to visit malaysia girlfriend she called me earlier today and told me I am going to be a father soon boots
tan so happy for you by has a huge surge in cases in the interior just like united states here have a great time in Ascension Island
was really hoping to see malaysia here but the amount of cases there are still not decreasing
malaysia in not worst country of covid cases a mil infected in a country of mil in total that is even worse then us india ratio
decks yeah hopefully it will get better soon and the borders will open again
in yeah i hope so too
you still believe in the vaccine and the pandemic
pandemic is meant to promote the dangerous vex sin
i don't know why you choose not to believe
amazing grace the logic is flawed
wee did you do any research before you said that obviously not right you probably even believe in the bad sin marketing efficacy of of instead of its efficacy that is a a despite seeing so many bad sin people catching it you probably believe anything when you are fearful that is normal i do too but i started doing research
amazing grace forgive them they are blinded by fear and the need to blindly follow others but third shot coming soon see if they can think
then what you believe in got better solution
one hundred and eighty cases now thumbs up its up trend of a cases can be achieved by weekend till then two hundred to three hundred is the new norm
chan the experts had said that the number will go up of a of a and even up to of a coming these days dons normal just lives your life as per normal
future its normal till medical support limit exceeded
there are many more still under she and to after per test even more infected to be added on
kos king so observe safety measures and live life normally get vaccinated is important
life goes on what is few hundred of cases where population is few million even few thousand is nothing compare to millions also it is not as if if they open up you will get infected and infected does not mean sure death everyday people die due to many other reason stop everything impossible
lin exactly the virus i shall i wIll not go away just get vaccinated so if by any chance one get infected its just normal I shall i Illness and likely to recover in one or two weeks i work in the frontline and I have see so many posit have cases and likewise people who recover one only get very i shall I will if they are not vaccinate or body is already very weak to begin with
another released
germany just announced eth wave nick infections in a day thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
thanks for sharing
term how about back to lock down looking at the current trend
lock down would only happen when
pap in hard situation if lock down people go mental a a river valley murder may not be for you but there is a long impact on others on the other hand there is rising cases
they do not know wat they a doing
sure good idea how big is your bank account do you have plentiful monetary funds to share with struggling singaporeans who will be in dire financial needs if our economy shuts down indefinitely if not take time to grow a brain wont you
low class comment write something proper law
yah low this kind of people never think of other people he think lock down means close the door and sleep all they long only
to and complaining and nagging are unhelpful
is not it of why still need so many tight measures
rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy lucifer certainly lives in you
i fully agree with your comment
thai me in last four month by waiting or in hope in september end
germany got eth wave bubble your head
bubbles already burst many times now its called lanes
one wave have not settle another wave coming
bring back for infections more biz to close with so much restrictions
when open bangladesh
germany had yesterday eight thousand five hundred new cases
if majority of their population have been vaccinated those cases docent really matter
yon sixty one at current many infected are untaxed kids but most of the come away with nothing much
roll of that not really high majority enough but if they germany want to open whose to stop them as for the kids even if only one of them fall seriously i shall i will or died due to covid of how your going to explain to their parents just calling it a case of bad luck or misfortune
germany is now having eth wave
this rise coincides with the end of most european schools a a weeks of summer holidays kids coming back for school and people going back to work from holidays
bird that correct and along with it more testing on return anyways the ice load is one thousand four hundred from about thirty thousand beds of a of those needing serious support such as oxygen are unix that is what the singapore government aims at too
travel bubble to queensland australia soon i hope have close family there that we have not seen since early of of
my partner is waiting for me in perth but a will fight tooth and nail to keep borders closed
brunei still close they border because covid nineteen still in they country
germany just announced eth wave nick in a day thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
if singapore can consider us a why not open for indonesia
in malaysia opinion although indonesia want to take a risk to open for country which has low testing level since they may bring import covid cases to singapore nevertheless i hope the government can re open the border asap when things are already well
cases as in infected people most infected recover
the endemic fallacy theory will be a very costly mistake at least it did not cover one aspect when the atmosphere thickened with viral loads possible open cremation like india
pap in hard situation if lock down people go mental a a river valley murder may not be for you but there is a long impact on others on the other hand there is rising cases
the vaccinated peoples action party ministers should all infect themselves with co it of and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory
do not worry until last call for the of vaccinated people is done and closed but you may get the consequence yourself too thumbs up good luck mate
cha by what you said then everyone can vote for change to protect their elderly who for valid reasons cannot be vaccinated those who lost their loved ones can also join in even those taxed can also join in because forsaking is clearly unfit to be any leaders and cannot be accepted malaysia wish is for them to learn from how to love their citizens and how to properly contain the virus for the life safety of everyone
one hundred and twenty three these elderly can a way stay at home but most wont and do all singaporeans want to accompany these small percentage of people to stay at home for like forever
cha singaporeans at large are zero tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated singaporeans at large are against importing of fwd or its from higher risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives
cha law also said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there will be leak from time to time we know that these risk could happen would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to risk because as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore

cha law said on the twenty six jul two thousand and twenty one we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated note the capitalized words mon will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening a aug
cha vaccination should never be used as an excuse to risk singaporeans lives forsaking the life safety of singaporeans will not be getting malaysia vote

one hundred and twenty three you cannot based on youtube or feb comment to say they are against it and so what if they are against it have anyone raise a legal objection
cha how many singaporeans willing to serve army but they served nevertheless so let others teach the min how to run the country and stop them from finding excuses time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news

one hundred and twenty three compare this government to malaysia thailand into philippines you will be crazy to want to change it
cha don party they won the new sen gang arc in get of and this is a fact and the party is apparently running the town council very well despite wild claims that they are not able to manage
cha how many singaporeans willing to serve army but they served nevertheless so let others teach the min how to run the country and stop them from finding excuses time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news
cha by what you said forsaking the life safety of singaporeans then singaporeans have the right to elect for change regardless of the risk for the risks upon their lives
one hundred and twenty three anyway the point is even our iasi ministers not iasi about this show that they got utmost confidence on the vaccine you can only say sour grape because you cannot be vaccinated
one hundred and twenty three like i said the previous time if you are not happy just migrate to the fact is majority chosen pap
cha you are clearly a liar because you speak irresponsibly and carelessly hence you have no credibility substantiate with evidence the statement implying that you have evidence that i cannot be vaccinated
cha all patriots are to stay to vote for changes for the benefits of everyone and not just to benefit the rich and powerful or be fooled by the enterprise machine is singapore belongs to everyone
cha time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news

cha released barking here too slightly smiling face
cha like i said don party they won the new sen gang arc in get of and this is a fact and the party is apparently running the town council very well despite wild claims that they are not able to manage
cha where are you from
one hundred and twenty three i agree about balancing up the parliament but i find it distasteful that you are claiming that we are living miserably as if there is any better way to tackle the pandemic the issue at hand is all about maintaining the balance between the effects of the measures at hand while we want to minimize the number of its from high risk countries we also need to consider the impacts on the economy you asked why the need to take in its from high risk countries but do you have any suggestion on where to get the workers to tackle the daily mundane tasks aside from these high risk countries
so your suggesting to continue bring it from high risk countries to ramp up infected cases
where a you from
hong songs indefinite international isolation and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully forsaking the life safety of singaporeans will not be getting malaysia vote
one hundred and twenty three you are exhibiting stupidity instead but what is more important current situation or investigating some allegations that is not even a of serious compared to said racks and that man is still outside the bar
just today one hundred and seventy seven locally transmitted cases ninety unlinked poll results show nearly of of high income earners in singapore face money issues sep asia survey
chan you go and tell people where you are from first la better put your scary cat face too so we all can see
one hundred and twenty three wow why you keep cut and paste comment ada approved pfizer already so very safe and jab and jab and jab if you are mayo and above
cha so where a you from
cha just where is your dignity or credibility as i said you are a liar at the very least you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser done expect me to reply to a liar
chan you say first then i tell you
thu just another freeloader that ditched or country
one hundred and twenty three term i did not ask for any of this statistics ism just curious that since you suggested that we do not import our foreign workers etc construction workers cleaners from high risk countries where should we get them from
chan it should not be hard to infer where ism from based on what i've written in the comment in fact ism surprised that you actually asked
isl will the first to die if expose he is so frail even triple dose also not enough covid wind is super strong even with vaccination super storm barrier the wind chill alone can kill him
in a time like these stop all unnecessary construction except the absolute essential life critical ones priority on the life safety of singaporeans and employ strategy as active waiting until a proven solution is found
your insistence to ask silly questions like fwd sources clearly showed your warped priorities over the life safety of your own fellow singaporeans especially when there is no answer for the variants when you break your leg you wait for it to heal when there is a hurricane you wait out in safety also read strategy as active waiting when you have no answer you wait till you have a definite answer particularly when peoples indefinite international isolation and look how new zealand handles and controls the virus successfully
lee family where got so easily die all at least reach ninety to you die he also have not die
one hundred and twenty three new zealand has seven hundred and twenty one active covid cases as of today despite tough border closures and lock owns what worked last year may not work so well this year with the highly transmissible delta variant arden is being urged to reconsider her zero case strategy they may have no choice if they cannot get back to zero cases
one hundred and twenty three already stop unnecessary construction for a a years until construction companies bankrupt a la essential as well you think blanca on consignment can bring in just one or two to clear rubbish only
check your typo compare this with one hundred and eighty new cases of covid one hundred and seventy seven locally transmitted cases ninety unlinked
cha just where is your dignity or credibility as i said you are a liar at the very least you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser do not expect me to reply to a liar
exactly even brunei cannot stop it either already proven cannot control so just get vaccinated anyway this guy got health problem doctor do not want give him assurance he can take these vaccine so he own self do not dare take vaccine with upcoming restriction for vaccinate people he want to change government and want those small parties people to run singapore crazy because workers party also urge all to get vaccinated
one hundred and twenty three heard that new zealand also burst so whole world everyday change government la face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy like malaysia
chan looks like hubs bios and construction and returning to normal lives can only be safely resumed after two thousand and twenty five and only when the parliament is balanced up time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system for example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news
one hundred and twenty three resuming work in of of are you a prophet what makes you so sure that the pandemic would be over by then it a need to in the first place in malaysia opinion that truly escalated the risk of the virus spreading and is itself a bad decision when our country had recovered so well several months ago
chan he must be from china instant singaporean
matt and you from the pond
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing chinamen angry meow
i did not say the pandemic would be over by of of i said the construction works would resumed after of of please read carefully and not jump to a conclusion and you did agree to balance up the parliament which implies that you agreed we need all the real capable and talented people to lead united states out of these miseries hence the logical and sensible estimation will be in two thousand and twenty five and only when the parliament is balanced up substantiation the virus was knowingly brought in lawrence wong said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there will be leak from time to time we know that these risk could happen as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system for example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news
one hundred and twenty three no need of of next year two thousand and twenty two can resume active users just be careful stay safe stay at home let the vaccinated risk the storm outside rolling on the floor laughing
cha just where is your dignity or credibility as i said you are a liar at the very least you should be defending yourself unless you are a loser do not expect me to reply to a liar so you agreed that you are a liar since you are not able to provide evident to support your falsehoods as demanded
one hundred and twenty three a liar calling me a liar you lie the most here everyone know how pathetic you are maybe you should go or sheet not vaccinated rolling on the floor laughing
one hundred and twenty three its clear that you do not have the answers to malaysia question i asked you where to get our foreign workers and what is your response you said i do not prioritise the safety of our countrymen what kind of answer is that you also insisted that we halt construction works because of the pandemic so shouldn't the construction works return only after the pandemic is over and in your assumption of of this is why a total ban on foreign workers is not possible if the global pandemic is not over by of of what makes you think a balanced parliament could do any better than the current parliament set up what should they do then continue banning the foreign workers until when until the next next election this is why i keep emphasising on alternate options on securing foreign workers if you want to ban workers from high risk areas you better have back up options also be careful about playing the countrymen card because ism sure many of us especially is men would point our fingers at you for suggesting to cover up the works that the foreign workers left behind
do not need to answer your silly questions because they are unimportant and singaporeans themselves can easily distrust it st readers singaporeans are mostly educated as long as they read and become aware then i considered myself to have achieved regardless of how you think or how you want to makeover their minds away from the truths time to balance up the parliament to induce healthy competition resulting in true real talents in parliament to lead united states out of all these miseries and not be simply bulldozed through using the arc system for example no sign of investigations by peoples action party into the allegations of ivan him one year since pm leeds promise to do so as read in the to news
one hundred and twenty three this also a call to all st readers singaporeans ask yourself these few questions a is there any alternative to where we could source our foreign workers any country where its people are willing to do these jobs in our country any at all
don lawrence wong said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there would be leaks from time to time we know that these risk could happen as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore

cha I am still taking all the measures needed to avoid contracting covid
eight that really know they had contracting covid or not as our symptoms are less and mild
one hundred and twenty three all snatch new water face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
very few incoming travellers will be prepared to undergo four expensive per tests and then a risk of being locked up if one of these is positive if covid is now endemic and we are protected by vaccines there is no logic to inbound testing germany for example does not require inbound testing for vaccinated travellers
we are opening step by step cannot rush and end up with too many cases and overwhelm our health resources we have to work hand in hand with our govt
it looks as if the st is too ashamed to report one hundred and sixty one new cases of covid one hundred and fifty six locally transmitted cases seventy nine unlinked what has what is up
one hundred and twenty three media manipulative reporting
one hundred and twenty three as of one september of of pm the ministry of health mon has preliminarily confirmed one hundred and seventy seven new cases of locally transmitted covid of infection a we are still working through the details of the cases and further updates will be shared via the mon press release that will be issued tonight
germany just announced eth wave nick in a day thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
when china open its border for international students like singapore
i believe singapore have not know when they will come and it stresses them all
me too johore bar please shopping
me three
big round round rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
so near and yet so far
when can the jew united states of america visit me have lots of money grinning face with big eyes
i am desperately waiting for visiting singapore
for what you dining to visit singapore
mobile usually i like to travel malaysia last singapore trip was in two thousand and nineteen at that time i was amazed to see the marina bay sands moreover the people of singapore are so friendly the most important reason is shopping so as a tourist i am waiting when will singapore lift its restrictions for tourists do you like travelling to singapore
yes precisely travelling is singapore pastIme we can travel to germany now I am looking at berlin I shall I will hope the world is better for all thus you are welcome
mobile thanks brother i like singapore because in singapore everywhere i see discipline and i love the skyscraper in orchard road so i hope you will able to travel berlin as soon as possible
when brunei reopen their borders crying face
wat at india der no list or any info at india
since I am fully vaccinated i need to travel to india too need visa been waiting for long kindly open malaysia too only for those vaccinated not vaccinated not thanks
you needs to travel to india what got to do with malaysia opening up or not
you is required to get vaccinated to mayan at restaurants but covid is scared to be inside fully crowded buses even if you is not vaccinated also some little kids are immune too
when will reopen in singapore from indians
social distancing mean taking transport to work in crowded trains and buses the push to re open offices is a death trap allowing visitor is really not the time now
hopefully soon travellers from india will be considered please do it malaysia family is separated for almost a year
better for you to go back to india and pay them a short visit then come back do not bring in more covid nineteen cases
whether your vaccinated or vaccinated you cannot guarantee that corona virus will eat you are not
come on turkey
pfizer has not finished the final phase three trials for the vaccination it is only slated to end on twenty seven jan of of as such the vaccine currently administered is an experimental one any person who chooses to take this vaccination is involuntarily subjected as an experimental subject for a trial that i do not consent to partaking bear this in mind pap
so are singaporeans free of she when they travel to those open lane countries and later back to singapore
this is how the virus spreads
expats are not equal foreigners are angry the one day close open lanes it shows bad planning they are leaving the quality expats so what foreigners are you bringing low skill jobs white blue colour beat singaporeans work jobs so what you get in fact is no longer talented expats but low end quality then singapore become a third world status because by influx the well being of singaporeans is not taken seriously
new variants coming from asian country myanmar is one general ming doesn't tell you they are having huge outbreak people creating day vaccine and having lung damage no doctors rate oxygen so you should question of millions spread does it give you delta delta plus delta so
brunei is reporting about two hundred cases daily and over three hundred today in a tiny nation of only about of of people also it has extremely low vaccination rates singapore sending of of of modern to them and very poor epidemiological epidemic controls it does not trust their government with their infection numbers and has extremely low vaccination rate singapore covid task force is putting singapore to unnecessary risk
all should be tested regularly regardless of open lane
if you do not open the border to china there will be no china virus pics are effective carriers of the virus
opening of the tourism in a selected country is a good idea for the economy of singapore
going to overseas now do holidays not a good idea world still in pandemic whether vaccinated or not vaccinated
hope the australian government learns from this here sentenced to two years imprisonment
awesome singapore but what about a vaccinate people but healthy
are you serious there are twenty over pal who are fully vaccinated and get infected with covid now they are using ventilators to breathe in the hospital
what about student pass for indians
apply again when next year if covid under control
if they can trust those european why cannot understand the logic
getting people to be vaccinated is all part of their plan mouth say worry for you but truth in fact is they need those vaccinated numbers in order to negotiate deals with other country to open border so for those that got acc and believe gov cares for you good luck
germany have nine bordering countries european they are borders free can we trust them they de clear hope they can at at least put them in hotel three days even the test pass
i believe reopening border is too early as we do not have sufficient data to guarantee a safe reopening of the border knowing very well what is happening all over our regions it would be very unwise lives are at stake maybe test on reopening in singapore more fully before reopening border because of economy alone i do understand the importance of singapore economy but this is what the government must be prepare to shelter from lives are at stake remember the vaccines were developed in a rush and is only approved for emergency used by ada and the future effects are unknown
i like how vaccinated people in the country itself is more dangerous than those coming in from outside the country segregate unpack people but allow people from outside borders to come in
that muppet logic for four
in two months they will start shutting down again guaranteed just wait for it the vaccines don't stop the spread and masks only slow it a bit new shots will be needed so rinse and repeat
now one hundred and eleven cases liao
belgium is a very racist country
please update the covid of travel restrictions or rules on the website of ministry of foreign affairs make things easier for foreign travellers dons job is to serve foreigners hence the description and language used may not be the same
soon singaporeans will be unwelcome in the animal kingdom only the smartest and strongest can lead the pack for survival
sure bring them on there goes all our efforts
the travelling a think go next year better grinning face with big eye thumbs up
germany is a nice country but very far and pricey i korea to open up for travel am sure many singaporeans are waiting for Japan South Korea
i miss singapore too law cannot wait to travel back smiling face with tear
have to wait for a long time seriously
its not that nice country only in the cities where are people of colour the west is a racist place i would never leave singapore or any place to live in a racist country
belgium is the worst racist country
looking forward to travelling again but not too soon
then do not travel stay in your turtle shell
this is what i call playing against the house with the odds against you
grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
so who did you vote for
wax not for the current board of directors that for sure best prepare for when they roll the dice and we are made to pay the tab
him outdated
bow when is the five per table in coffee shop and hawker center going to happen
a its a legit question it was part of the plan no need to be sarcastic
just say its about money la so many bull crap excuses living with covid is singapore being normal with no mask wearing and public gathering first not opening borders to more variants
a for id that dine in two pax max and unpack cannot go gym air on feb and many more other activities are still waiting to open up is the normal lao inside country lives not even fixed yet for residents now want open borders sch
go back he macau still need quarantine fourteen days who wants to come own self declare own self safe when their government press release already stated they are not going to talk about the travel bubble with singapore at all at the current stage
formula for covid of of new variant re not a steeple
org a lion thank you for your bravery
bro you missed out the part where after vaccinations they set rules to segregate those who had the to not get tax but end up ken their stupid in tax tax restrictions
it take guts to open and go back to normal living thumbs up thumbs up do not let fear rule us clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
just come up with a good self test even better then the one we already have don't force people to take vaccine or segregate the untaxed especially when we have no idea how long the juice will last very very scary this segregation and control when its not that serious if you not very old with underlying disease
hah aha only now singapore i thought you were so damn rich not to open your borders why scared now yawning face face with tongue
hama this is for the benefit of the government and its private company we try to persuade our neighbours and friend to get vaccinated thinking that our government will treat this covid as a endemic so that we have little or no restrictions but instead there is no change in restriction they wanted to lift some travel restriction for their personal benefit all the hawker center will continue to suffer poor business what a joke this is how we are fool by this bunch of heartless idiot
well done singapore its logic to let pandemic become endemic
with delta variant it will take a really long while for businesses to recover maybe will never recover
low open up for say training
unfortunately germany just now gets into a a wave as announced by the renowned robert koch institute
than we close again again
so who did you vote for
i was thinking should i come to singapore but now I am happy that i have not decided yet
better not until both have zero cases stay safe
we are happy too
where are you from
may ism from florida
so basically similar things will be happening to australia in december when the country will reach the eighty percent vaccination rate it will probably also establish four classes of countries to travel to and from australia by december singapore australia two way travel will be probably very likely with seven day quarantine at accommodation of peoples choice only vaccinated travellers can get into and out of australia
australia never reach of rate
if you can remove boarder restrictions then let united states remove masks and local restrictions of fully vaccinated already we have jumped all through your hoops allow united states to live normally again
could not agree any better expressionless face
looking at us and us the people had the choice to take down their mask then see what happened after that be patient
may far as i can see they have been given a choice to not wear one but still do when in large crowds we have of fully vaccinated so that's more than enough to at least not wear one whilst walking around outside i would wear one on public transport but not outside
eighty six its one hundred and two degree in ohio i will not wear a mask outside face with steam from nose
government open travel in desperation of money citizen of singapore do nothing and gains nothing but are exposed to the potential of delta variant wide spread
now they change it to lane travel no more bubbles wrapping made in china face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy let try this lane initiative
a to thinking face
what about far workers transfer new rules channel news asia ply update hello
china need to ban singapore as they allow europe come in
singapore do not depend on china
a really afghanistan want eat malaysia lunch
we are helping to take care of three of poohs family member here inn singapore zoo you can have them back if you want
i look forward to travel bubbles but can we just sort things out first at home it feels we are again rushing into something that will only reignite another lock down later on
i have the same feeling
not bubble it is lane far smoother less trouble
olympic two thousand and twenty two aftermath well a least we are trying to move forward
good more lock down stay home no need work
good decision sir spore economy cannot only depends on sporran plus faster further ease of other country
yes build more mortuaries and i us let us welcome all visitors
if we assume all foreigners here are vaccinated big assumption and foreigners are a pc of the population then does that mean that a pm locals or a pc of locals are vaccinated
what about malaysia
malaysia of of a new covid cases yesterday what do you think
hell no it will never happen for now grinning face with sweat sorry persevering face
why you asked that for obviously now is not the time
org a making mistakes again on border control in order to control the spread in endemic mode we still need to try to keep our case numbers low esp from overseas imports so the initial she is still vital all passengers on arrival need to under go the rapid test a min results if negative she for three days followed by another test before release to the public as passengers could pick up the virus on the plane or their airports etc tax pax who test be are still contagious please do not get mistaken that tax gives total immunity it only provides mainly protection she from foreign country is still essential giving no she is a fundamental mistake to the hard work singapore has put in vac should be our safety net not a main net border crossing via because way may have come in without she if they are regular taxed workers daily commute but must be tested upon immediate entry non work pass holders in visitors need she for three days testing before release remember going endemic mode does not mean we remove the care to keep case numbers low and we should continue testing of cases like now but most all of our business can open
this is about via not country or people the shareholders need to be kept happy
positive move we cannot close borders forever
we have never truly closed the borders they just cannot take the risk opening up to singapore
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing sounds familiar
no more bubble trouble travel cant open the community but can to europe a brunei
its time for another good idea bad idea are we that desperate for tourism business
it is to for via survival that's the plan
not just via but also for change airport garden by the bay sent a hotels restaurants etc
may which are mainly foreign owned or held by foreign entities winking face
tee which are many peoples bowls of living
may we are responsible for china india malaysia indonesian about one hundred and ninety two nations employment yet the singapore core is the one paying for it winking face
may many rice bowls for it and pass and work ass and ups
actually yes
you can take ten per test but who is perfectly fine from any part of world please allow them why total ban if they are vaccinated months before covid do not hide from covid but we can fight from it
good to open up the borders but calibrated airlines need to work to help the economy all over the world
with delta virus no thanks
its not fare if we cannot travel totally not fare
life is not fair suck it up
and how bout singaporean those has taken their vaccination can we go for travel and meet up reunite with our wife and kid
do not ask singapore ask the destination country
go then do not come back
reopen inside singapore first then open for others

why singapore
nair why open when the situation is so bad there
I have spent all malaysia money on stay cay low
true that
used or sri too
even travel nowhere
pm travel from singapore to singapore face with hand over mouth
the tourism voucher yamaha
stay cay so sad to liao beaming face with smiling eyes
great more china
all vaccines are recognised but only mana available on national program muppet logic
bantam reopen thinking face thinking face thinking face
it they vaccinate its citizens faster
just open to bantam first of already vaccinated st dose of vaccinated and dose new cases below fifty a day weary face come on a
must be at least eighty fully vaccinated i a both doses
a yeah but singapore is opening up to other countries that are not of fully vaccinated right now like in this news
for a country to be able to open to other countries it must have of of of its adults population fully vaccinated singapore will say welcome to the people currently in australia next month but australia will still be closed be because next month around this time australia will probably have only about of of its adults population fully vaccinated australia will be of fully vaccinated by early december so i think it will be opened by mid december but it also depends on whether other countries already allow their citizens to travel to australia for indonesia a lot of countries categorise indonesia as a high risk country in terms of vaccination rates vaccination reliability and accuracy and the measures they do in indonesia to prevent infection such as restrictions face masks etc there are low risk medium risk high risk and no travel countries i think indonesia unfortunately will be in the categories which is disappointing be because i want to travel to jakarta etc too it is almost impossible to open only select areas in indonesia like bali and bantam because usually when a country opens it opens the whole parts of the country
if singapore of vaccinated can very the can can open the border thinking face thinking face thinking face
selma a country will be open to other countries of their choice if it is of of adults vaccinated but if the other countries still do not allow the people there to travel to that country which is open to them then there is no points east asian countries have much better prospects than be asian countries in terms of opening of their countries so maybe japan south korea taiwan car hong kong will be opened by the end of the year but for be asia no i wished i could travel to be asia by december but i think the only countries i can travel to in sea by december will probably be singapore and brunei
selma you need to refer back to category four they stated the countries that they banned pakistan india nepal bangladesh sri lanka myanmar not malaysia or indonesia but still need to wait and not rush for both indonesia and malaysia
selma have to wait unit we produce vaccine here then can we decide who to sell those vaccine to
why not the us we are close to of fully vaccinated
cos united kingdom is she
because number one didn't united kingdom suddenly had a delta variant surge and number two were trying to not to end up in another lock down
you a how is it when everything is open like normal if you want to know what a is then look at new zealand australia
one hundred the whole globe almost has the delta strain now over time new strains will come the united kingdom death rate is low now compared to the st wave life is normal here now they is no social distancing measures here they united kingdom realise that lock owns do not work
travel show well yes but the united kingdom still has way too many cases sure they are vaccinated but they are carriers and with the delta surge in the us the chances of imported cases is much higher
travel show if lock owns don't works and vaccines don't work i guess this how life ends
you a ceca worst than
hoping to salvage their stock portfolio ten or liber is poised to explode the global money cartel is sick of fed res lies for so long that's why stocks are crashing
such irresponsible government using people as stakes in gamble economy goes up down all the time death is endgame singapore will be shunned world wide irrational policies create dangerous situations
if you think government is not good by all means go and migrate smiling face with horn you need not have to criticize until like that angry face with horns
you don't speak for all singaporeans and the millions of livelihoods on the line
government cannot appease everyone when the local vaccination rate is reasonably high it is worthwhile to take the risk to reopen the border and do business so many sectors are dying
品味历史品味人生 i hope a higher official in thailand think like you we have to move on from covid
chop you know anything
of of a vaccinations daily means in the next fifteen days we can get another a of a of a vaccinated and hence only the of a of a below a year old are not vaccinated by then singapore will have of fully vaccinated
antibodies that exist in the body for approximately a of months depending on the immune system of the vaccinated individual this is not a number game
tee he hall auntie he only try to be optimistic law not sour grading
eight hundred and eighty eight salty uncle
eight hundred and eighty eight go finish your schooling first before trying to analyse data
jumping the gun to open prematurely to expect positive result outcome is wishful thought it will not work
only way to find out with empirical data is to try otherwise its just opinions and hearsay
this a good calculated risk
rush to open up is unwise a stupid
lets see the effects of blood clots at high altitude
is there a doctor on board
such a stupid comment
you a so you think others are stupid and you are really smart modesty is a virtue while arrogance is always frowned upon
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy savage
remember to get vaccinated or a vaccinated person might get sick from the virus they got vaccinated against because you are not vaccinated rolling on the floor laughing
living with covid means it should start in so not a damn travel bubble it should not start with a travel bubble
exactly
that muppet logic for a
living with covid just observe what they do and tell me if i am wrong they lied to you again
get prepared to get poke of for a round trip i read that on via website
its cancelled in two thousand and twenty one bow
want oktoberfest cancelled back in may
a wonder how he does his job face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth
thank goodness germany had the sense to cancel it why would a sensible responsible great want to attend the oktoberfest where there are literally thousands of people crowded together when corona is still rampant in germany i implore screens not to be too if they decide to vacation in germany and bring the virus back to so keep wearing your masks avoid crowded places especially indoors and behave responsibly in view of pandemic
three
interesting how silica know if any europe passport has been in germany a days before depart to so mtg mil match
man no stamp when crossing europe borders bro and you call yourself
there is no stamp of that because in the europe they go from country to country and don't need stamp
i agreed even the tourist stay twenty one days in germany it doesn't guarantee that he she is free from wuhan virus or its variant please rethink the policy carefully if spread happen again peoples action party may lost next election
now i already very unhappy how pap mtg is handling the covid and believe many others too if only more people are sober and already voted out peoples action party at the two thousand and twenty elections sigh
sass a good candidate can stand a better chance in election but most of them can not make it
now very true
man no needs to chop stamp for europeans moving within eur
the jury is still out about the full picture of covid of and the vaccines experts differ in their analysis and are still debating it look at all the flip flops coming out think very very carefully expose and listen to all views let the individual decide no forced vaccination
when open for malaysia
stupid idea do not need quarantine why singapore government is playing with singaporean life all they think about is heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign when is the next election we should know who to vote now not those government that is playing with our life really very disappointed with our government they only look after those foreigners and money money bag money bag money bag money bag money bag heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign
huh wait first la
that one infected person has still sat several hours breathing in the same air with passengers on the same plane on his way over here the other passengers could be infected on the flight by him then spread it in the community a few days afterwards
this clown lie blatantly covid will do justice soon
so the message is
of good luck to all singaporean with many visitors we are going to see the surge in infection in this tiny island state
can we retreat to our shells
good decision for opening a border now every country open a flight
what a waste of tax payers money making vaccinated travel lane scheme
what do you mean waste tax payers money we have to earn income from outside because we have no natural resources
insider low that is a nice poem he he
coz it mean that tax or no tax its still the same all can be infected
over welfare of citizens
cannot trust your statistics anymore sleepy face
what to do no more lock down in singapore because we need to survive economically already cannot do anything
oak and the min coerced on to tell you about the long lasting effect damage and the unknown long term price singaporeans have to pay these episodes clearly showed citizen life safety and well being are secondary in the eyes of the min
most vaccinated countries the more cases israel singapore gibraltar
obvious tax is the cause
lets have more tourist activities but singaporean stay at home plus for goodness sake
from weeks to vaccine passports so when will you isolate and purify the virus no info on has mon website
we have people flying into singapore every single day even before this travel lane nonsense the mon website shows that between a of cases detected daily in the past twenty eight days so many of them detected upon arrival never believe what the media tells you look stuff up they manipulate stats to suit the agenda
no worry singapore have more covid than malaysia and indonesia why bother now just open all borders
by forcing his eye lid wide open we still think these opening of borders will meet with serious consequences
there is nothing we can do singapore has held its economy for one and a half years and were been suffered for that soon or later we have to re open the border of course with careful management i have felt the impact of this border closure a hard way
a closed border policy is suicidal
i then in the freaking first day we do not be screw by those idiots that trying to continue to enrich themselves on the expense on the others
at a recent in meeting in new york city where vaccine mandate was supposedly enforced it was approved that those attendees to the in assembly are exempted from by vaccine passport
us is masonic state first they killed all native indian than bring all baggers from europe and with this class they try to enslave entire world and put under register
in in are all under mason law approved covid not to be delivered to them i mean if they happen to be under ventilator
insider protect our family against the van seen
its the no you will be controlled
if the freaking vaccination is so effective why are we still on mask these people are all sick all along talking nonsense
exactly
nobody is saying vaccination of a protects so have masks is okay
you can be defiant and walk about without a mask your choice who's stopping you be the next karen only book will dare to put himself at risk with the law or at risk with getting the virus
use your mother feminine napkin on your mouth better of of safe even with delta improve
ernie do not show off such things law vert
ernie bro ignore this a just air all the minister farts smell like rose to him so that figure what kind of person he is
hey par cum par how are you doing
a and stop going around calling everyone bro soliciting
even nazi never prevented people to travel and meet their families of are double vaccinated what gives you right to keep people families as hostages for two years not let in them cross the border in malaysia and you let people from europe to enter
for all malaysian you can leave as and when you like just do not come back anymore that include your country accept you guys
ernie allow me to enlighten you a you have all malaysian guarding your police cd employed by cisco and singaporeans suck rocks
ernie ism here to talk justice and not take sides or make bios review don't forget without foreign investment singapore is nothing
which means they re worse than nazis
of a interesting thing is australian government is calling non vaccinated protesters nazi so what they have done all this decades to allow nazi to stay in australia
insider you've malaysia full support let united states all rise up together and fight the evil
too many change airport terminals so they need to open all
of course we must cover what we spent more tourists better
yes more virus coming in better huh paw cum par
the tourism and travel industries are already doomed do not expect a a shape curve recovery anytime soon even by plucking the infected figures from the air
too early too fast to too many countries that are totally reckless
cannot survive on bananas law
starting to feel like zombie invasion movie face with tears of joy
only one fish there seem to be a plot to displace the locals and bring in as many foreigners as possible despite the pandemic
racist singaporeans are in denial that foreigners are not am not getting covid rolling on the floor laughing
yea bus singaporeans cannot work on salary less than two a but expat can because your government that you voted give them free logging
studio who says of not enough if not enough work harder in us a working two or three jobs is normal
fulfilling pratt wish
or i no need to be mean
kit does not matter to faced politicians
would you prefer the economy to collapse or find a way to live with the virus judging by this comment you must be oblivious to majority of the businesses and employees whom either lost their jobs or had a pay cut and is affected by the economy seems like either your industry or wages has a lucky not to be but i see suffering all around me
he is a regular whiner he knows nothing about spores economy just nagging and whining
so money over lives whf has our society come to why are you all defending the ones who are clearly in the wrong we only live once it do not matter whether the economy fails or not as long as there is food water and shelter the rest are privileges talk at economy when you have at least a degree in economics or else keep that mouth of yours shut and stop being oblivious to the situation
hello you just slept for the last one hundred yrs and emerge from the cave food from where drop from the sky or are you of with eating grass and air what about water we are still buying water from malaysia or are you consuming raw rain water and toilet water without desalination what about maintenance cost for your shelter home electronic gadget out of order or perhaps you don't use modern electronic gadget oops forgotten that you just emerged from a cave food water shelter all required surely you don't need a degree in economics to know these basic knowledge right so its a matter of you die from virus or you die and became a hungry ghost chances from dying from virus may not happen if you have the vaccine and if you do not have much health issues but without food and water you will not last long
you are comparing singapore to united states or us do united kingdom how small our country is compared to theirs is it okay for the country to go of case per day and it is still increasing previously from a of case a day are we not suppose to do smith at it just be cut of having a lock down for weeks or so just to stop cases will not because business to bankrupt malaysia boy the government still has plenty of reserves to spare if needed nobody is spoilt here we are worried for our safety be because of how small and dense our country please learn some geography
gal huh food water is everyday necessity these kind of businesses will never go bankrupt whf sarah alpha not opening borders does not to lesser crops food water not opening borders does not to unable to call some to come fix malaysia toilet pretty sure all these are common sense
bow pretty sure endemic does not mean opening up borders to foreigners just for them to bring in more strains of viruses delta variant is brought in from other countries so that is not endemic
yes correct if you have the funds but many will not have enough money to tide them over if we continue to lock ourself
the virus already all over everywhere all over the world so how long are you going to lock yourself in forever close for two weeks of well bring it down and then what how many two weeks are enough for the zero cases not sustainable and definitely not long term solution
the number of death and the number in ice are the numbers we should be worried about if daily cases are high but these two numbers are relatively low then we can treat this as normal flu
bro just ignore this just air do not you know he is champion of carrying lee sign long marbles while he was carrying lee sign long farted and he say it smells like roses another word for him the ultimate paw cum par
gal another paw cum par anymore vacancy
hey paw cum par how is job doing remember dons the most precious and important cum par in singapore
gal not sustainable so we ignore and let the covid case snowball and wait till there is of deaths per day and our hospital overwhelms then we do smith about it its about preventing that from happening not waiting for it to happen bro stop defending the idiots there is absolutely no justifiable reason we sold open our borders when our station here is chaotic of only reason is about money and that why i said money does not value more than human lives we are not guinea pigs for experiment they are toying with our lives just because of money what has what is the rush of opening the borders when only a small percentage of the people in the world are allowed to travel stop acting smart here its ridiculous you will not get additional money for defending them its because of people like you that we are not getting the change we deserve people like you who defend whatever the people above are doing and does not criticise the most obvious things that they are doing wrong
a a yamaha fax bro they think lee sign long sky like they are two diff pal brush sarah alpha a
a still painful grumbling grow up a bit and start living life grumbling also no use and no need to be so vulgar even though you are short on education nobody owes you a living
ironic of you talking about lack of education reply to malaysia shit fool since you have an of education
science shows that the countries who do lock down have poorer resilience even in us the cases are not translated to serious hospital cases proportionately
bro no need to talk these people a fart smells like rose to a person is their brain already down in their ass
bow go paw your boss cum par la subject does not make any cow sense at all
a cow sense or brain dense also no need to use vulgar language we are a civilised society except that few but i certainly hope you are not in that latter category
they say we judge the grace of a person by his language still have room for improvement
whatever no need to tell me about your civilization education or manner i have came across many highly educated people and friends some even came from well recognize uni from states and they are nothing but jerks not even a gentleman to treat a lady save your manner and bombard english for yourself to me you are just selfish park only think of yourself
go figure out in mandarin what does it mean

hey paw cum par a of a over cases already how
a too late to grow up too late to regret malaysia sympathy
for these comments shows that you are indeed a selfish park a of a over case already how man with no backbone pity you only know how to paw cum par
par cum par why so quite your boss is coming out to talk after cases sky rocket be careful to carry his control and make sure do not drop it lei he may not in a good mood
a do some national service and it would make you less vulgar
first time paw cum par gets work out low ken your point already go paw your cum par la talk so much
so mini sir means the measure was not working on south asia country tat let delta entry to singapore cos so much pain to citizen wat went wrong different class people or different class class country or different govt measure policy
all food and supplies and almost every product you use comes from outside covid spreads through touch as well and on items covid will eventually enter either way you can only delay it not prevent it singapore would die a horrible doom if you really close borders as singapore is the farthest thing from self sufficient actually other countries can easily close their borders and let singapore die if singapore remains to have this attitude as other bigger countries have their own food water and power etc delta is now everywhere and it did not come to singapore from a south asian country if you are educated and informed at all also its just a variant the first one came from united kingdom next maybe from singapore what is your point so is nothing without open borders
hap moro plus go to us a the clever will take their family by plane the stupid will put their family on the raft a enjoy the sea ride every step is risk a luck in air or sea thousand of excuse a million of assumption wat is rite wrong who is wise or fool the with everybody was to rule the world save yrs elf

testing negative on arrival does not mean he does not have the virus he may test positive later while going around spore as the incubation period is fourteen days
agreed but with of plus cases daily in singapore now id wager the traveller got the short end of the stick
we will have to live with the virus
so how how to open up economy and keep covid in check
one nine hundred one thousand amongst of a of a travellers at its peak just need five days implying one thousand five days based on previous peak

learn to distinguish between low risk to higher risk countries hong kong only five cases average per day singapore one thousand
hong kong has one billion chinese tourists they dons travel bubble
but singaporeans end up suffering mon will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug this was announced in the press release by the ministry of health on friday evening a aug and law said the virus would leak into the communities from time to time so they knew singaporeans at large are zero tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated singaporeans at large are against importing of fwd or its from higher risk countries just to benefit the rich and the powerful and their cronies companies at the expenses of singaporeans losses and the losses of innocent singaporeans lives
soon we may be considered higher risk human since forced to live with the virus
one hundred and twenty three keep posting the same stuffs will not alter the situation

lawrence wong said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there would be leaks from time to time we know that these risk could happen would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to risk because as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
you need to learn between lower risk and higher risk countries and the need to protect and safeguard citizens life safety as priority when people trade your means of livelihoods and risk your life safety will you rest your children future with them two thousand and twenty five what has what is up
one hundred and twenty three it is not a choice we must not cut off our advantages in the hubs by disappearing long term damages are at stake if we lock down the world waits for no one
please stop the is and excuses to continue with the imports of cheap labours to benefits the rich and their cronies companies causing so many more damages and disruption and hurting the economy and risking on citizens life safety when people trade your means of livelihoods and risk your life safety will you rest your children future with them two thousand and twenty five what has what is up
lawrence wong said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there would be leaks from time to time we know that these risk could happen would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to risk because as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
singaporeans have never been consulted with and it is solely the min decision these episodes clearly showed citizen life safety and well being are secondary in the eyes of the min
i prefer tourism to be off the list till the global situation improve tremendously and with an ongoing covid of spike happening now this is a terrible mistake
he opened ocean park for tourism why they know they cannot close
they opened it to tourists already
gamer i heard that they are wooing vaccinated tourists from guangzhou and macau
wheres only opened to the hong kong public who are vaccinated
let us close all borders who cares how everyone related to tourism and travel industry is suffering which is most of singapore but clearly you are not well all of singapore depends on open borders so probably most companies will shut their offices here once we let no one travel i hope you lose your job first
hap have you ever thought about how the people feel about the recent spike in cases do you think they want tourists to exacerbate the already deteriorating situation also i dins safer to do so
gamer newsflash its never going to be safe until herd immunity is reached singapore is of vaccinated there is no more protection other than getting the virus and developing natural antibodies the virus will never go away and people who are expecting this are delusional smart countries will open now and suffer consequences than suffer in lock down for three years and then be in the same situation
if system is working new variant would not entered singapore and because another spike
hong kong opened ocean park for tourism anything to say
lawrence wong said a may of of in defending the imports we knew that there would be leaks from time to time we know that these risk could happen would you doubt that he put the citizens and the nation to risk because as early as april of of singapore sequencing reveals the highly contagious delta covid of variant was already spreading in singapore why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
how many infected case in hong kong now do you know
comparing hong kong with singapore one thousand cases and on exponential growth a you sound
wheres the link hong kong has a zero tolerance policy and did not agree to travel bubble with spore when we decided to go endemic
another incompetent
agreed how to trust with mind manipulation half baked and half truth insincere min
one detected how many undetected does he knows
of course he knows perhaps you are the only one who does not know
we will know when our case numbers get to ask unlinked cases
hong kong opened already with ocean park wooing tourists and our neighbour with lanka i no need to be throwing blames around
one nine hundred one thousand amongst of a of a travellers at its peak just need five days implying one thousand five days based on previous peak these episodes clearly showed citizen life safety and well being are secondary in the eyes of the min
he knows how does he know
a you really dense we had twelve ice on friday eighteen on sat twenty one on sun of to eighteen is of growth and our ice is only starting to reflect numbers and time lag from two weeks ago where our cases were around of a so maybe two weeks later you will see one hundred and eighty in ice a weeks later you will see of of please think before you speak
even ask is not a problem you need to get or head scan do you understand the implications when singapore has ask
just released to comment nonsense
chan yeah that is fake account low life lapdogbasketballtongue
plus take out your masked if the system is working hoodoos
absolutely looks so ugly when speaking to journalists in the public the more appropriate way is to use transparent screen
the answer to end covid in of of david wilkerson said there will be this thing called the corona virus and then church buildings will be taxed and shutdown there are no true church buildings today anyhow because church buildings in biblical times housed poor and homeless people plus they all teach lies and then omit any passage that would require them to give the bible says its the poor the homeless the widows we are to reach and give to not fake preachers that twist and lie about the word of god

if you are vaccinated pass a per test three days prior or what ever can we still travel through singapore with a direct flight to say the united kingdom from australia
the public cannot understand
they the gov knows which country to open or allowed them in beside the saying we all have to lived with covid just get all citizen full vaccinated
cannot singapore must lock down again
yeah we should become poor again starving on the singapore streets
opening up is inevitable whats our plan if these travellers coming in became seriously sick and overwhelm our medical facilities and complete with domestic demand what if foreigners cannot afford to pay any requirements that they must buy covid insurance
if its not an acceptable plan
latest new juicy news
why no news coverage on pfizer whistle blower the claims as outlined in a report by the british medical journal by allege that time and financial pressures may have led to serious misconduct
so many sheep with no brain
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
we know singapore of of of the last time i visited marina bay sand to enjoy new year i hope good days should return soon
i think sing government has started this scheme to attract tourist to give push to already suffering tourist industry airport operations and i think they could also test the technologies for covid protection
chiba evil government
pfizer buy patent from modena to produce their vaccines under their own name only dose difference
how come indonesia with lower than of vac rates able to enter but not malaysia that already passed of
vaccination rates total insanity
singapore is all business probably these two country play bigger part
if each aircraft have to make its nos to recover and make profit what is the expected visitor a day from each of these vols countries if these people are sick who is to pay for the medical fee and should they be send back and will not be able to get treatment here to further load stress our hospital system
i thought indonesia will not be able to complete inoculation until end of december
we are in bantam already green zone since two months ago also bin tan other part of java island still progress for recovery with vac programme
malaysians will flood in to take up security jobs paying up to a of sing dollars in ten years time damn that ask ringgit pay back in malaysia probably of ringgit or lower thanks singapore low

bantam here i come when pocket become empty all kind of abbreviations follow along vol she a finally whf
for opening of granting free land vaccinated travel lane to malaysia i would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity all public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings for every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated that way safe distancing can be maintained should also consider allowing private hire cars registered only in johore bar and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
should have done this a long time ago and focus on healthy lifestyle and healthy eating but make it our choice to still keep the masks on i need to hide malaysia pimples and not wear makeup
open up the trade routes but check the travellers coming from china china is focusing on war trying to establish itself as the world number one power it is highly suspected that china interfered in the united states two thousand and twenty election because they cannot have the defiant courageous president trump opposing the in and china in his and term and hence the weak biden in the white house open trades with israel too after all we are not a racist nation if we are open to islamic nations like indonesia then open to israel too china is more focus on war by the way open to other news network like fox news can and strait times are bias
still talking the western world and united states democracy and human rights are shit nonsense useless and declining
this is a very responsible and capable task force
keep your man made experimental tax i don't trust your science i put malaysia trust in god red heart jesus saves
come people let united states put our hands together to welcome all twenty nine different variants of covid that we have currently into singapore as we open up more and more to these countries yeah and let us pray that through the opening of our borders those twenty nine variants will mix and match to give birth to another twenty nine new variants with even more deadlines thus having fifty eight new variants bred and cultured in none other than our little red dot hallelujah
three yes god is looking down on our covid task force and shaking his head at them if that what you mean
so what is your point lock down the country for the next five years world has started to live with covid whether you like it or not if you are too scared just lock yourself inside your room and never come out
for your information more than half of the countries around the world are currently still on lock down especially more so during this period as winter approaches so get your facts right before telling someone that the world has started to live with covid only singapore is the good one continue to push to open their borders other countries see united states must be thinking re just a bunch of clowns that do things without thinking
him which world are you living in united states and european countries have opened their borders long time back now india thailand and few other asian countries have also opened their borders keep in mind all their vaccination rate is not even of nobody is saying singapore is so fierce so brave it should have opened its border much earlier once we hit the of vaccination mark you get your facts right
just because you lock down you think that singapore will be safe forever if there are new variants emerging somewhere else in the world no matter how much lock down you propose the virus will somehow seek in so once for all stop all this non sense of locking down
first of all are you even singaporean you logic is like no matter how you lock your house someone will somehow still break in so must as well leave your window gate and door wide open
tan i am a singaporean do you go around asking these questions to everyone first of all your logic here does not apply to virus we have experienced it before even after lock down and border restrictions the variants were still able to seek in now with more of vaccination rate we should understand that and open the borders that is the point
stupid people do stupid policy and continue their folly they continue to bring in covid of by letting people in and boast about their stupid act and feel happy doing it
let us start the bollywood dance
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything
ism too lazy
do you mean he was waiting for most of them to die and their kin to suffer till then

travel at your own risk
every twenty eight days about ask over people are infected in just ten months at least more than one million people would have already been infected with the virus maybe only can fool some of you say
the vaccinated peoples action party ministers should all infect themselves with co it of and demonstrate to singaporeans the less severity or asymptomatic as they said then it would show without doubts what leaders are made of to lead singaporeans to their endemic theory
can you learn how to spell covid of low
single party is unwise and dangerous
you should see his household for their losses and then resign for the loss of innocent singaporean lives talk more no use
implement rule but do not supply manpower to do the checks no way coffee shops will sacrifice their manpower to do thorough checks

not everyone in a country is anti asian most are peace loving people who loves people visiting their country
germany has a much more liberal and accepting population than the us do not assume the worst of the western world just because of the stuff the media portrays
love travel yea not after covid
limo main reason is military overseas training in germany and brunei do not think leisure travel was priority when opening these vaccinated travel lanes
probably what a smart way to make a loophole dedicated to military personnel
whether its going to have little impact forcing travellers to stay at one place for not less than twenty one days and other restrictions obviously is not a kind of tourists friendly measures
hatter wonderland its twenty one days within germany which is big country
the policy maker in this particular choice of needs a brain vaccine against illogical decision i live in europe just before coming back and germany in without healthy scepticism in this present age
i great news to me because i am working with a german company
if you can easily feel happy just by a single news headline without looking deeper into it you also can easily feel depressed by a single news headline your emotions would in the end dictated by the mainstream media truth or falsehood have little meanings
well care end for you to comment on malaysia post that is funny

a germany is too expensive
wait guide you think we have so much money to travel to far away country hah like yours no sweating work but have so much money hah
the criteria are quite puzzling the four territories vary a fair bit in terms of new cases and vaccination rates so what determines whether a country is on this list
oktoberfest is cancelled this year very knowledgeable expert low

pap will be remembered if all of these abandon rush to open up singapore for the sake of money end up in deaths i will be laughing out loud if one of their families is the ones among the dead
so negative mindset pap so far had succeed control the virus
trust the a leadership who in turn absolutely trust the experts committee for covid which such powerful nexus working hand in hand everything become predestined
bush not at all the peoples action party have constantly blank out these facts about the vaccines as well
song an of of
which makes one wonder how professional reliable this travel agents spokesman is
president of travel agent says go for oktoberfest in germany doesn't he know oktoberfest cancelled back in may
as much as i am excited by the news we should a the risk of the colder climate affecting the severity of the virus and what if another lock down is initiated how do we get back into the country if singapore enters another lock down period or if germany goes into lock down
even during lock down singaporeans could have always entered singapore with just she
not sure if i would go to germany in winter the virus situation can change in the cold climate if you decide to go towards this years end then go to a place with a good christmas market they are called weihnachtsmarkt weihnachtsmarkts are beautiful and they do have the best seasonal mood in the world examples are nurnberg muncher leipzig you may also include the alps the mountains look gorgeous with a snow cap and the capital berlin
so prices to germany are skyrocketing now bow
if we have another circuit breaker after this then who will take accountability
they will said due to vaccinated people
kos king how to blame unix when most tax are the ones travelling anyway they will find excuses to pass the buck
yes this is what I am trying to say
profit muhammad be careful of your name a look at what the muslim did when someone drew something about islam in paris
looking at the vaccinated travel lane vaccination travel lane in reality its worse than the current travel restrictions nothing much will change come sept a
seventh months again
german has of daily cases and less than of fully vaccinated i do not understand the logic here opening up to germany
well germany has a population of around eighty four million compared to singapore five million and with a little match done and percentages calculated the proportion of cases are roughly the same
they have not included the rest twenty five countries statistics
wino did you comprehend that you cannot go without restriction to any other country than germany at this moment no twenty five other countries or you do it illegally
what are you talking about germany has of of its population fully vaccinated
roll as per end recommendations and most of the europe and she gen area are currently green as well as some third party countries albania australia new zealand ukraine singapore south korea japan north macedonia serbia hong kong macau taiwan armenia azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina brunei drugs adam canada kosovo moldova montenegro qatar and saudi arabia travelling from germany to other labelled green one do not have to do it illegally
wino you can only travel to germany when using this travel arrangement
roll currently singaporeans can already travel to germany without serving a quarantine there regardless of vaccination status
wino the point is not going there its when you are coming back
we have more than six million we are infested with malaysian ceca families foreign workers including maid
roll i have found the answer to malaysia reply thank you next time learn to read and comprehend the reply before on others
wino the new rule is unitary for those who travel from singapore to germany germany had allowed already unitary travels from singapore originally you were asking about the other twenty five countries which you can not visit under this rule how do you rate your cognitive skills or do you just want to stir the shot
wino exactly most people were actually deluded by the media as though they cannot travel or severely restricted to travel to germany or europe prior to ctr which is absolutely untrue vhf makes little difference to those who has business need to travel
roll i suspect you meant to say not unitary
wino anyway who will benefit this vaccinated travel rule seems more like a marketing stunt than anything else
roll we feel your angst you are not alone the least you can do is to communicate with your family back in germany as much as time allows stay strong
wino thank you for the wishes edgar
year i can see malaysia friends again
stay there and don't return to spread the virus
wong jealous rolling on the floor laughing

sarah shah its pretty manageable not too cheap but not too expensive too
let us move on hopefully more of the population gets vaccinated since that the norm now and just open it up and go things gotta move the world and economy got to get going fittest survive covid is not the only thing that can harm human so let us move on

no search yourself you are looking for things to criticise
thor nah i am not are not no commie only cup commie like you do that
as usual running out of things to criticise pathetic guy
pathetic commies do not understand the non commie world
no you commies here and commies there do not you have any logical and rational rebuttals
thor non commie logic and rationale does not chairman i teach you this
this is typical
no confirmed that your only capable of commie here and commie there
chan do not put it in such ugly terms we have always been a very pragmatic country
thor low openly betraying chairman i and cup no wonder chairman i needs to ban youtube
thor low since when are cup minions considering singapore as the same country we allergic to commies let
travellers entering singapore also need to follow the measures and locals get to travel to the countries under vaccinated travel lane agreement with singapore as well
no i see china as the major source of destabilization factor in the world with their rise in economic and military power and their acts of aggression it resembles the rise of powerful germany under hitler which eventually led to world war a i hope china suffer the same consequences so that there can be peace in the whole world
singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cold response and harsh restrictions and segregation maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity can united states cd places singapore in highest travel risk for cold fox bic looks at situation with migrant worker dorms latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct with
axum that is the risk we take for opening up else we will always be in our tortoise shells so be practical one day you got to go around looking for a wife after some courtship with some girls you decide on one then you got married then she did not turned out to be that perfect after all your aunties and uncles start to criticise you for making such a choice did your initial decision to find a wife wrong or you forever remain single so nothing for your aunties and uncles to criticise
haifa they down la singapore covid cases is uncontrollably high whereas the rest of the world is opening up again hash a
you will be surprised at how mistaken you are
thor how exactly hmm
tong kat so far have you heard of any country cancelling their vaccinated travel lane with us that why i say you mistaken
thor i hope they do for their own safety even so could you be so kind as to provide me with countries that are actively opening vols
thor you opened the vol but no one will come I am sur you know what
tong kat we are just going through a phase soon we will exit this pandemic like other countries
of sex true but at this moment countries should proceed with caution with singapore they seem behind
tong kat they are a bit more brave while we are too cautious the thing is I have read a lot of comments bout why we are facing this while other countries are now returning to normal and they blame the leadership truth is in early days we were spared while the rest suffered the full onslaught of the virus and the virus is like pay now or pay now we are paying
tong kat france denmark italy the united kingdom the netherlands spain the united states and canada are the latest additions to a growing list of countries for which singapore is implementing vols these countries had already unilaterally re opened to vaccinated travellers from singapore just google
of sex in the early days pretty sure sing was also the worst in as an for covid dunno where you got that from but sure
thor i cannot confirm that may be true from online sources maybe your source is from local or state to that i cannot access but even then all i ask for is them to proceed with caution to singapore and for them to not risk their lives personally i think singapore should be responsible and close their borders so that they can bring covid under control
tong kat for infection yeah but the death rate was lowest about less than forty for the first year
singapore has been getting some very negative attention in international press for its cold response and harsh restrictions and segregation maybe it is time for less harshness and for more humanity can united states cd places singapore in highest travel risk for cold fox bic looks at situation with migrant worker dorms latest is business times announcing singapore will be classified a as of oct with
axum right maybe you guys are not am not used to negative press the mature thing to do is to not be over proud obsessively defend your nation like a few commenter
with august two thousand and twenty one
with september two thousand and twenty one
hama and a few mind on from this the drive thru testing have line ups of five hours
these people are so much smarter than nova do movie
the reason they do not mandate testing the vaccinated is because they would be positive and they do not want the world to know that the vaccines are a failure
do not you have to isolate while waiting on results
no point now the children can get vaccinated
hi singapore kids on december with for age under twelve years old children should be get vaccine and then go back to school after new years why on the boxing day start toward please take your vaccine soon
gar nina do one art test face like the swab poke all the hole those who need to do every week or every day be like rolling on the floor laughing
is vaccinated
i see those poor people with slippery noses everywhere such an affliction
low travelling with vaccinated kids must be fun
i actually live in sydney and omicron is exploding of course it is the obvious choice to stay home but our choice is to be careful and wear mask and do not go to high risk places
very safe because they have immunity unlike the vaccinated who has filled the hospital
why australia you might get smashed because of your look they love public civil obedience and disturbance over the smallest dissatisfaction to express their immaturity
you are awesome thumbs up medium skin tone thumbs up medium skin tone thumbs up medium skin tone let us visit malaysia with vaccinated travel lane smiling face with heart eyes
waw malaysia negative comment got removed
someday i hope under twelve years old children to take the vaccine like as pfizer modern sin vac sin charm etc like in china and the united states under twelve years old are doing the covid vaccine
travel if necessary else at this stage the sign of virus gone is still not guaranteed since it keep transforming do not rush to travel unless you have time money and patience to burn else remain within your boundary human visible fighting the invisible not easy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
holiday travel warning do not travel into any jurisdiction with a high prevalence of unconscious co idiot politicians news reporters witch doctors or border guards suffering from covid psychosis mass colitis or ass india mindful posts your well being is at risk
agreed at least wait until all these criminals prosecuted in nuremberg trials
the real question is do you guys ready to get infected or getting other infected
sydney and new no longer need to isolate seventy two hours after arrival
true and today they had a of a cases and you do not have to wear a mask
its not how safe its more like how lucky
another great clip from steven china love watching good vibes in sydney
unfortunately now in new our covid case numbers are sky rocketing again
most people do not want to learn from two thousand and three cars and delta and any pandemic in history just love to play dumb the only weapon you have against pandemic is both quarantine and vaccine
weakening people the media are the virus lock down the media
over of of a breakthrough cases sick a covid in arizona alone but it
just a reminder kids themselves can be covid carrier if you want to ban vaccinated adults then ban vaccinated kids as well both are at risk of carrying covid
there no difference between varied and untaxed in terms of ability to spread the virus
better vaccinate if they wish to travel children are also carrier of virus as much as elders or stay home safely very simple
shockingly misinformed post cannot believe people are still making such nonsensical statements after so long
expert knowledge not from medical but economic studies
is not at who can spread the virus it about how the untaxed will have more severe symptoms than the varied and fill up hospital beds
eliza go we have been hearing this for two years now and still has not happened perhaps invest in better healthcare instead of shutting down countries
just wear a mask easy fix
who cares if the brat dies how safe it is for the rest of united states if he does not get vaccinated just give to him or keep him home kids are a disease
i don travel that we used to have for the next a a years
more like forever as long as people keep complying blindly to their lies
vaccinated kids are allowed whereas vaccinated adult are not allowed where a see a balanced data
i also don their immune systems but remember that they could also become carrier to their parents grandparents
that why they are also going to be vaccinated law if not what we all do not travel and lock down is it
kids have stronger adaptability to covid simple as that
for the covid of pfizer vaccine researchers found that kids ages five to eleven had a similar immune and safety response at one third the dose used for those ages twelve and up in other words the children immune system is not fully developed yet so they give a lower dose but according to logic they should give a double dose corona virus vaccine has again proven to have nothing to do with any disease or virus
the question is how safe is being vaccinated
low vaccines
meanwhile here even we belong to one of top countries with super high vaccination rate someone still constantly thinking of booster and even eth booster want endemic but hum i to open only thing in his mind is only booster and booster nothing else
must be nice to have the money to travel and not worry at extra expenses
you only live once
calling the price of the flights as is a bit disingenuous
very dangerous to bring kids for holiday because they want to go to toilet than what happens to the kids have covid oversea than they have no hospital
mel the majority of kids will not have severe symptoms from covid
how about featuring families struggling during covid as well only a minority can afford to travel during the pandemic
agreed this is the real selfishness
only few people can afford to travel at the best of times
hewitt i do agree however what wrong with channel news asia doing this this is also a lesson that people need to know that you do not travel just for the sake of vacation there is a risk especially with a young child
more change of being bitten by a venomous deadly snake spider
germany opening up for for military purpose
is not it for tourists
amazing grace perhaps military is another likely reason
amazing grace brunei a germany a two military training places
chan you have a valid point
amazing grace i do not think there is any tourist from these two places
damn the of idiots really messed up three hundred and forty four cases out of pm population is like of of a cases in china germans will be rewarded with a covid virus to bring home singapore is worse than china covid situation
so vaccine passport a conspiracy now grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
your app showing you are vexed is already in itself a vex sin
amazing grace lord have mercy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing smiling face with halo smiling face with halo face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth
we have new expert popping out everyday where are the former experts now
what was the point of rushing to of vaccinated if they will take their time to open up the borders to vaccinated travellers
you meant the point for getting people vaccinated in singapore was for travellers to come in
sort your thoughts and recall what exactly was promised to you via vets nation fully version rated are fully protected
hiring germany people one day before covid thanks
germany is having eth wave due to delta a expect a of approved to arrive geniuses
singapore should open up to all fully vaccinated travellers more than of of singaporeans have been fully vaccinated this virus is not going away anytime soon
a you really think your protected after vaccinated
i rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
amazing grace he will find out the hard way
chan i done sure mon will be able to provide you the above numbers to show why singapore made such a decision to slowly ease and open up
the singapore economy will surely collapse and many singaporeans will surely starve to death
i face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing or you so ignorant
i did mon reported those numbers plus go read up by comment
chan is ignorant very soon
let us see vaccine long term side effects first you seem to be dying to have more people come in
i in line with singapore govt is stupid
chan singapore government has been transparent upfront and inform their citizens every step along the way they have done everything possible to protect singaporeans what has what is there not to trust singapore
dry this virus has been killing united states in so many ways right in front of our eyes the vaccines have been administered worldwide for more than eighteen months now data has shown that its the long term side effects that we all have to deal with
i data show its working rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
chan its working
chan let us right or wrong
i its proven time not needed
chan of well i have to say you are wrong
i you can say anything you want the fact is vaccines is not working
chan you can say anything you want the fact is vaccines are working perfectly fine
i face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy those infected a vaccinated you do not know
chan of yes break through infection that is
i face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
of of a rip of a of a injuries as of with june american database of adverse drug reactions for covid of vaccines actual numbers are likely sex
of per million
these figures grossly underestimate i know of families who is extremely fanatical about vaccine they do not want to report their family members died be because of that they use all kinds of excuse to hide the because and government officials is behind helping
yeah sure champ
israel one of the worlds most vaccinated countries is leading the world in cold cases and hospitalizations
they will go down and emerge winner
racing to overtake israel little island always want to be number one
nine israel of the east
him what makes you so certain
will they subjected to reduce non essential social activities for the next two week too
we need to open our borders more so that new variants come in to test the games policies
test already failed signs a not reporting daily cases a stop reporting unlinked cases a funny words emerged
thank you channel news asia for this report on singapore swift intervention to demolish this pandemic
besides malaysians that stay in johore bar and come to work in singapore daily there is another group of singaporeans who stay in johore bar that needs to come to work in singapore and return to johore bar daily please allow land vaccinated travel lane granting free travel both ways for this group too especially those who travel by their own private vehicles with only two or less passengers or up to four pass if they are immediate family members all vaccinated also those who who are vaccinated and stay by their own apartment in johore bar should be facilitated to allow two way vaccinated travel lane granting free land travel soonest possible this group is currently suffering for having to stay in hotels for over twenty months now just because they could not return to their johore bar homes
of dear i did not know that only malaysia can provide work permit holders to local companies
hire me i know tech and finance
lift the lock down it should be the governments job to protect and feed us i guess the only option is free anim
schedule law one mph one person only can go back
they paying malaysian the same with singaporean what has what is the problem
just give malaysian the privilege to take leaves and go home first as we are suffering from homesickness and mental torture
as singaporean i apologise on behalf of malaysia country a channel news asia for above lack of empathy report for especially our lower income of to hold those who need to choose between affording for their family or their mental health let us keep stricter law to explode the poor from poorer countries rather that costing all our govt officer families extended families in laws friends businesses to have to pay more reasonable rates to attract locals
ask apple sector of mayans brand he is champion apple
i supposed those long months earning a savings finally get to be with family maybe even malaysian one people one nation go against their govt who said we will make life difficult for those not vas
why are we hiring malaysians and also filipinos for pm jobs these kind of jobs should go to locals first
locals do not want law he will tell you locals are very hard to employ surely you can trust a king apple
not true it is those blue collar jobs that locals shun pres are white collar jobs
malaysian workers indian workers chinese workers lanka workers united states workers europe workers burmese workers thai workers pakistani workers bang la workers pinot workers indonesian workers view workers they have one common denominator these workers have to return home one day except one particular group that is been neglected the singaporean workers who have no where to go
employ singaporean if all the it because foreigners labour are cheap so the employees only employ foreigners but not singaporean
ask apple sector of make sutra sector is king apple you should be able to trust him
singapore is heading for big trouble
better law guide you make money we locals have suffered a lot standard of living are so high our locals pay make united states suffered you make money foreigners too we locals get rises of transportation rental utility fine here fine there cut your salary is better guide
family members vaccinated still cannot meet as we like only two persons two visits a day now household members can dine together but not family members but everyday thousands of foreigners coming in govt opening up recreational facilities for old and young all these means more cases while the rest of us vaccinated must stay home as much as possible does not make sense to me
inevitable choose between mental health and economy
there is no place like home especially those who love the price pay what ever you have to be back home is more important money can earn back
the relationship between viral dose and covid of severity tulane researchers chad roy pad and or gregory big this review found that the virus is primarily transmitted through the inhalation of particles containing virus and that the ability of those particles concentration of viral particles plus the length of time one is in necessarily experience more severe disease than an individual who is infected with a smaller amount
thank you singapore for looking after us
covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant covid vaccine is a obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite
bring in cheap labours from many countries for the benefit of government but local sporran suffer
locals do not want the jobs ask sector of make sutra he is the king apple
singapore removed from europe travel list may affect vols on the factors considered when deciding whether to recommend travel restrictions for a particular country the europe said they cover the epidemiological situation and overall response to covid of as well as the reliability of the available information and data sources ref asia one min failed internationally
bubbles all bursts what happened to the lanes
well returning home is important for a good mental health
so perfect one hundred on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
in the law of nature the leader does not practice yin and yang balance they always want to pay themselves high and pay peanuts to the one below that is the reason and result or outcome secondly the leader do not protect their people and pay them better and always look out for it due to cheaper cost nature of laws knows very well the heart of leadership payback comes and now the leadership must open the eye of their heart do not always think i have high pay is god blessing but in reality or law of nature you retribution comes unless you practice balance just and fair else 富不过三代 so simple
of did your poor family have fallen to the bottom of the food chain now sad sad sad winking face with tongue smiling face with horns
do not you feel a shame our pioneers who build this singapore from ashes are working in mcdonald like cleaners and you are filling united states with billions money for under every fighter jets that you crab in ten years make project so that our old singaporeans can stay for free in old holmes house with good care where singaporean nurses will look after them with high pay
dream on will never happen nothing is free in this world sky said it you want the best somebody has to pay for it who else
studio good for you someone has to have dreams and hopes

so perfect one hundred on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
japan death is not a go and check world meter
used cheap labours but food prices still expensive
the ingredient is expensive
else how to collect in excess of ten billion money bag money bag money bag in foreign levies to pay the most expensive pm on the planet a of of annul to mayors for dunno doing what
prices going up on today news so what has what is new eat simply cook on food
price sex is not be cut of labour cost its be cut of the rental cost not happy can cook yourself simple as that
vaccinated so what still can get infected and germany has so many cases must be crazy to go
yes stay in your turtle shell while we go ahead with our lives
sure tortoise good luck to you
i think he get some points but why you get angry and insult him
fine you can share a turtle shell with him while the rest of united states go ahead with our lives
have to remember that of of is of with this so they should not be complaining
i was wonder who is the transport minister now when i was taking the public transport
what about china they star this covid nineteen virus transmitted
he malaysia teacher friends still do not get to work as how they use to but going to different schools and now you want people from overseas to come priorities
please open all lifts door salt in singapore when not in use to ventilate it and not close the door and keep the germ collision and far fire inside
the day vaccinated no need to wear mask is the day to open singapore now vaccinated still need to wear mask its premature they are jumping the gun
we need tourism in singapore and tourism will not end anytime soon we have to learn to live with the disease testing and vaccines are a good way to move forward
wait for ten years also not possible without mask
premature opening will he catastrophic effect that beyond their competency to manage
it wont tourists are vaccinated and need four per tests
face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth
interesting how silica know if any europe passport has been in germany a days before depart to so mtg mil match
can check with data ufa
feet dude have you been to europe countries cross border no need stamp passport
residence they have a trace tracking
feet europe has twenty seven countries which has a tracking germany is the gateway to so when they cross border each other no checking germany of network is worst seem like you have more to learn nice try dude
residence a can even detect twenty seven thousand countries seamlessly
feet in the world there a only one hundred and ninety five countries sori las mag to you alien
residence actually you are an alien in your own planet cos there are over hundred thousands countries on earth and many of it are underwater which only me can reach those kingdoms
so is the short answer if a breakthrough case occurs the vaccinated travel lane will be closed for maybe fourteen days if more cases are discovered the vaccinated travel lane shall be closed indefinitely
i am not sure about germany seems like their number of cases is pretty much in the four digits ballpark well then again what do i know ism just a blue collar worker who happens to accidentally glanced through times
compared to other european countries italy france spain netherlands us germany is able to keep the outbreak relatively stable and see no drastic spikes to the of of a daily cases
now singapore is ever ready to go to the next lap and singapore will succeed because the majority of singapore has been vaccinated
basketballs to you
majority of singaporeans are eager for travel lanes with japan and korea and particularly malaysia germany and australia are beautiful nations but i would say not as popular and affordable
singapore will fail
chan failure is the mother of success the world moving never wait for you life goes on no matter what happens never try never know
chan let us see who kids talk
no thailand beaming face with smiling eyes
mobile face with steam from nose crying face loudly crying face
why do you call him thinking face are you gay also
your father
one by one the free mason in government will receive their karma for bring harm to the people
reporter ball boobs shrink after getting the answer she have retorted immediately by asking what are they going to do if cases immediately spike up once they open everyone in that room are yemen and yes women waste of decision making talent and time
this is the plan
yeah all no basketballs boobs only scared of being sacked do pile of poos
once spiked up just refer to sop simple as a by
the open big big is germany and in this case we are the generator low
deal with extremely well i think you will regret saying this as we have all time highest infection rate yesterday of of face with rolling eyes
us has the most cases in europe plus new delta plus strain this is all a joke and i can only go out with one friend to eat
good job to our govt by welcoming tourist
when india
person gesturing NO male sign person gesturing NO for vaccinated travel lane countries only for now other countries please wait for vol
the more the merrier i miss ceca please speed up the opening up
person gesturing NO person gesturing NO male sign vaccinated travel lane countries only for now the rest have to wait for their vaccinated travel lane turn
put i am disappointed only vol the more the merrier as the faster we shall reach herd immunity grinning squinting face
a pm would like to but resource at hospital does not allow at moment need to wait till covid situation improved in so
put now you know why singapore could wait for most having vaccinated right cos countries are much larger than so they cannot have waited for high vaccinated rate
open to most european countries but not thailand indonesia china can ensure these countries control of covid are the best when open up hopefully stop finger pointing at singapore citizens
this country have very very very low child birth rate mean one child per woman only so its very very very easy to keep here peaceful environment and to do development
even if there were few imported infections we would be exporting infections the government wants to continue the covid legacy so that the global pandemic will go on forever
what street food
char way tow
welcoming more virus
welcome you can hire a car from me all are covid free cars
which car got co it rolling on the floor laughing
cases are a sad story here yet these travellers still do not mind visiting anyway welcome to singapore and be safe
what the of then urban the vaccinated now what a hell is the point of this logic when we know that the spike in cases has nothing to do with a unix and yet singapore is allowing eight different countries in how can you treat your own citizens this way and discriminate people who call this country their home this is not right
be wary of the anti vader comments from people who were first to vaccinate
first to does not mean that they did not wake up
i hate this decision tbs they need at least a day or two quarantine because hey you may be vaccine but it takes one slip and they can be carrier too hate this decision
mystery to the sudden spike in the number of covid of infections in singapore during the month of september the tightening measures to kick in from twenty seven september to eight october two thousand and twenty one is unveiled five thousand and eighteen germans and two hundred and ten brunei ans were allowed entry into so who is the real culprit for thousands of cases on a daily basis
well done task force
knocked out face knocked out face knocked out face
mtg thrust foreigner more then their own citizen thumbs down thumbs down
complain all you want learn to live with the virus as singapore slowly opens up to get the economy moving government cannot continue to give money to business and workers to close their doors and not working go get vaccinated or lose your rights to access many things in your daily life
welcome at a really wrong time where winter is coming
vaccinated people are okay they are we should be more concerned for our vaccinated data is consistent
a brilliant idea to bring in the new lambda variant when we cannot even handle delta variant from ceca
how many more do you want to see catching the flue a dining before you stop your stupid system going forward
ram ram lee burger what a great reply clapping hands
maid are you a terrified easily stay in a hole is also scary as it is dark
but if of vaccinated singaporeans survive from covid infection does that not mean of screens will have long term natural immunity effective for all variants
please do not blame the people or the untaxed for any future infection spike due to these foreign travellers into singapore we have spoken
nobody will blame you there are a lot of families who could not see each other there are students who need internships there are business people who need to travel spore cannot be only about you
come on this is just the and or ord trials for vols and there a limit to hoe many can enter out of thousands less than ten were positive after enter they suppose to test negative before entering do not be so anti foreigner and over act border cannot close forever hotels tourism aviation those singaporean working on these sectors has to survive
the nation that tried on so called zero case strategy new zealand has close to eighty new cases today they closed for how long you go and count much much longer see where they are today zero case surgery would hardly work
voters have spoken we prefer to open our borders and live free
please do not blame anyone for your decision not to vaccinate
they cannot get infected or become carriers thinking face
as long as one is vaccinated its not that risky
hello can answer palace travel form singapore to indonesia after can come back singapore
are you mad our government letting indian enter our country india the one who sending delta around the world now they sending omicron again
johannesburg has six direct flights every day with mumbai see you five thousand
omicron hype
there will be a blackout christmas for singapore
in a short time were going to hear about a worldwide border shutdown and full lock down to curb omicron virus spread the continuous relaxing and tightening cycle will prevail in order to inject the new world order into our lives
if can import omicron come you are welcome to come to singapore before all our feb and hawkers kenya close shop again
hawk eye your to even teach you basic english
after covid we have vaccines after vaccines variants after variants
after variants death to united states all
a mood right on the bulls eye but not for the invulnerable and vaccinated the survival of fittest common sense
nos every a so wrong death does not recognize if you are healthy unhealthy sick poor or rich even to the kings and presidents they come
a mood exactly death does not differential colour creed religion or race at the hour of calling however covid whatever variants cannot touched the untouchable that is the invulnerable and the vaccinated be discerning pure simple plain common sense
nos death does not discern anything
a mood what is death separation corruption of the fleshly bodies ashes the first natural not spiritual death will happen for all fleshly bodies
for safety reason india is imposing a cd quarantine for travellers from so
indonesia cases are still high based on the arrival test
singapore is higher
is better the border control is based on the arrival traveller that tested positive you can travel to singapore with a quarantine order
indonesia is not a good neighbours canon see singapore prosper
i really want go to singapore but after arrival in indonesia have to quarantine seven days it is not worth it for cost pensive face smiling face with tear
great more to come
its very understanding why indonesia still close its border to singapore because singapore case still higher then indonesia
because singapore no respect to indonesian

host hama
host stupid china have a a billions chinese
thong how can we take you seriously with that surname
so who care
stop this madness you cannot divide families forever
how can omicron be more dangerous when the symptoms are mild according to the south african scientists
viruses become less deadly as they mutate while less deadly they are much more transmissible
not this time
how much do you trust the a scientists compare to ten scientists from different sources said the same findings its still at a very initial stage you are too gullible period
not a good idea
yeah singapore should quarantine itself on mars
as his plays face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy with thanks

this is why we must never trust authorities to break the law in times of an emergency for they will surely create an emergency in order to break the law and once we have lost our personal sovereignty we will never get it back give them an inch and they'll take a mile if the totalitarian tiptoe is not stopped dead in its tracks the people are inevitably robbed of all civil liberties and inalienable god given human rights furthermore tyrants who are psychopathic by definition take advantage of the fact that most souls are inherently good hearted and trusting of authority
so government is doing a mess to the country malaysia cases not stable yet why let them in and quarantine free some more and do not imagine malaysia motorcycle coming in makings so much noise again and bad air pollution to singapore pouting face outing face outing face
meanwhile singapore cases the highest in as an per capita consistently the worse in as an both at the beginning and now nearing the end
this move is only a welcome to those working here to go home to malaysia to family especially elderly parents the data is clear that age of of are the ones getting infected easily thus passing it to the elderly
another good move to spread virus
malaysia covid cases increasing daily
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand
the travel industry is picking up thanks to the is cautious approach to opening up it is a responsible and capable govt
yes so is the hospital business
alaska just stay home and stay safe now got free video calls why bother to even travel at destination on arrival test be per after few hours exit customs go on the streets and then kenya then have to isolate and test waste more money and suddenly your stay have to be extended in isolation or worse in the hospital end up with big hotel bill or medical bill no time for business or holiday and return home tell me what is the point
calibrated moves making real progress
boost their mothers

serial rapist bet you can violate them against their will milf hold malaysia beer i got this
waiting for hong kong bubble to burst again
of vaccinated and of boosted record breaking positive cases death rate is back to square one we thought by vaccination and boosters we could protect them and now easing of restrictions allowing the spread most importantly allowing immune escape immune escape induces mutations and of we have to get jabbed with boosters again modern please we need your help
i wouldn't be surprised if they later tell united states get eth shot hah aha then eth then eth and so on first say one shot then two then booster later say need one more booster
anyone who refuses the booster are now labeled an anti tax even though they had just taken two shots six months ago anyone can become an untaxed anytime any day
singapore is home for real singaporeans not foreigners and not for fake singaporeans
not fit for the job find replacement whatever they coming up with its not making sense and is not helping united states in anyway
another name for singapore is end pore or sin city
indeed this as been the case since the start of the pandemic regardless of variant varied or not so its a rather irrelevant point they keep saying its within their expectation as if they let it spread only to pratt later on when it goes out of control
ever since the start of the global vaccine roll out in january of of some experts have been crying out against mass and rapid vaccination of populations in the midst of a raging pandemic if they are right this will go on creating more variants and prolonging the pandemic so far it is looking like it and god help us thank you channel news asia for this report and with this song of hope i pray for gods swift intervention to end this pandemic
is it true that after twenty five feb can go outside massless
braless and panty less but must wear mask at all times
but everyone just watch when temperature change and what the in built immunity from the not so severe omicron will do from then they will be seen by the citizens in totally different light with the salary they taking we can employ around six times the number of leaders to serve the nation we expect better results honestly

in the time like these when the omicron surges the singapore government wanted to increase the get then the bloody art test kits will go up then those patients who are vulnerable have to pay the hospital bills will go up and keep getting covid of over and over again to see a up with increasing get how to bloody cope economy will go down i do not extend getting more medicine from the tel medicine without risking ourselves getting positive again
of of a cases in one day must be the toto hong bad draw cases showing up
after this waves lift all restrictions immediately bunch of overpaid clowns already five hundred and twenty thousand cases most likely over a millions with people that dunno or not declared of fully vaccinated your expectation are what before we can have a normal life again of a have no or mild symptoms same numbers as flu we never requested anything before for flu
do we have irrefutable evidence that the mildness of omicron wave is primarily due to vaccination not be because the variant itself is simply mild enough to confer immunity and not because severe illness
stop forcing united states to take singapore airlines to save your investment just open the bloody borders
mems what has what is that i only know mem
i am seriously worried what kind of country this is becoming and how malaysia children gonna grow up well in this country malaysia kid even asked me is there no more democratic society as what they say in the singapore pledge

means don't need to take booster shot anymore a who good
vaccination status for citizens will expire after two hundred and seventy from and dose without booster how about tourists it seems that even if they only had two doses more than two hundred and seventy days ago they can still come to singapore and be counted as for thirty days from arrival why the double standard against citizens this is a question and not a statement of fact happy to be corrected if i am wrong
means don't need to take booster shot anymore a who good
interesting question will be good to have an answer
based on cam pretty sure what the answer is but worded malaysia in carefully given our laws

friday february of of of our lady of lourdes jesus said my people many of you have been brain washed to believe that the covid shots and boosters are good for you the truth is that each shot you take with grapheme oxide in it is making your immune system worse to the point that any infection could kill you after three shots you could lose up to of of your immune system the left evil ones are taking a page out of the communists play book if they keep telling you a lie about taking covid shots long enough you will begin to believe the lie but this is not the truth no matter how many times you hear this lie it is still a lie your doctors and media people who are pushing this lie will be punished severely for killing people and not using in erection to heal people when the truth is revealed the covid shot promoters will be put in jail for crimes against humanity the evil ones will side with the antichrist and they will all be cast into hell in the end malaysia faithful believers will be healed at malaysia refuges and they will see malaysia reward in malaysia era of peace
offer your little ones they re all in the same league
tourist are the main agent that bring in the virus variant of concern in the first place we only hope that the virus do not mutate further to prolonged the agony especially in countries with bigger population and larger land mass and whose citizens are not fully vaccinated
four hundred and seventy seven yet seems that they are subject to less stringent restrictions than citizens does not make sense to me
choose it make sense if you put first and ignore we of advices
he is about to ban vaccinated travel lane from singapore airlines wait for it
one in ten recovered covid of patients in suffers persistent symptoms six months after infection you think infected by it we are stronger few of malaysia friends and relatives after recovered still feeling weak after two months those recovered might start to feel the the body are no longer strong as before esp heart please take care folks and do not mess around its too early to know what happen next
disgusted the way the govt is handling this matter these are lives of singaporean at stake and you guys are relaxing measures
could always move to united kingdom its very nice here more freedom than america
now is like telling everyone get ready to be infected and you will have antibody
got covid means greater protection so why need ord jab
you know you think they do not know they cannot say and saba themselves
pfizer co said two jab is limited protection
andrews that why about five months recommend booster shots
and then
how many years need boosters
wake up look at hong kong healthcare collapsing be because their vaccination rate for old people is low look at their cases compare to ours if you manage to convince people not to take ord one you could potentially because people to die
wong quit imposing your choices onto others you fascist covid and omicron are responsible for to push the blame to the untaxed just because you depend on others to be varied so that you can be safe
low no mask no mask no mask no mask then the last guy wear mask soon rule apply to others but not to the big a

too many short forms speak english please
please clearly define who qualifies as a vaccinated traveller in singapore vaccinated persons are those who have completed their second dose for mana after a days and where due those who have taken their boosters within nine months from the date of the second dose different consideration for non mana vaccines if other countries do not follow singapore standards meaning the travellers do not follow singapore way of classifying vaccinated status are they still allowed to enter singapore as vaccinated traveller in short those who take two doses of non mana persons who do not take boosters after paths of their second doses etc because these visitors should be classified as non vaccinated how will or can the authorities validate the vaccination status of visitors
from what is currently stated on ice website malaysia understanding is that tourists only need two mana jabs even if they were taken more than two hundred and seventy days ago they will still be allowed and receive status for thirty days
what if they are fake
very rational approach targeting the areas that really matter more important than total number of cases is the number of severe cases because i us deaths healthcare system strain this is being handled the other important thing is allowing in areas in among people who where there is little to negligible effect so that quality life and productivity can be ensured both goals are well managed i rather have these metrics as indicators to determine when how to change these measures than say a prime minister party scandal as the determinant factor in the easing of covid
with high vaccinations rate and possibly a pm people get infected then singapore situation will go to new normal

singapore no choice need to stop the charade and open up in april or may no masks no safe entry check in since united kingdom has open up due to public outrage over their pm actions and in united states the supreme courts stand with the people against mandate and in other countries people are rising towards discrimination partying face and this is called political science nerd face not science rolling on the floor laughing

where are those guys who praised hong kong zero covid policy against our very own govt for flip flopping we are very lucky to have such capable task force thank you mtg
of thanks money will be credited to your account by noon tomorrow
a money will also go to your account from messes kaki but it
nothing wrong with the gov decision to use adaptive strategy for an unforeseen future you need to act like one educated person reason
wong but the virus never did change you have variants but they all spread fast with most cases being mild tell me what changed
be thankful if you are in he doomsday no hospital beds
another priam
talk so many but still five person so better do not talk waste people time
is there a system in place to verify the result of a art self testing seems to me a tourist can just report a negative test result using the app without even taking the test i have just looked at an art test i took at home last night and there are no unique identifying features on the test strip
its supervised on site
only for fans over eighteen years old growing hearted heart love letter heart with arrow
to thanks for pointing that out they must have changed it recently now all i have to do it wait until malaysia opens or just have a short singapore trip
this useless mtg think our body is like a plate of rojas got natural immunity still take jab for what
we open border when the cases of countries are high hong kong record cases pinkies record cases i bet the economy is going to collapse in less than six mph time
to actually before they dropped the daily testing it was supervised on days two seven i think and unsupervised on the other days it was the unsupervised testing i was curious about regarding verification
the initial reason they gave on why covid was supposedly so was because it goes undetected just like the trace together token
i have in visa work permit pass when will i get malaysia entry approval
when i say so
come in twenty years time
all they do is always rehearse how they maintain their income
do they know what they are doing
do you know what you are posting
what we know they are highly paid newscasters face with tears of joy
cannot accept the facts face with tears of joy
they are deserving of what they earn they can earn more outside politics get this right
really allowing travellers coming in without strict rules put the blame on the locals for the increase on infection rate call that a brilliant idea how much we earn its our line of work that we have chosen any decision made which may lead to jeopardize others safety is no excuse to cover up our own failure get that right thinking face
controls are all nonsense just open up and return to normal look to sweden which shows that no controls were just fine
sweden of law a big country such as sweden already have that kind of figure dense singapore can have all infected and at least of a of a deaths without control and you are actually of about it knowing that one out of five people you know passed away
ignore all these trolls and kids
this same group of trolls would complain if no restrictions in place and thousands of deaths if out of control
what good does it presents with spewing loads of numbers to convince people that how bad or how good is the situation of one country over another and singapore with even higher vaccination rate yet squeamish holding up is a reflection on their lack of trust to the experimental jab
three stooges in charge
loser get a life grow up we are doing very well as a country
no beds left in he give thanks to our task force
of voted a love to be screwed
says the loser with a half year old burner account
that going to be a great opportunity for hong kong to scrap its groundless so called dynamic zero policy and reopen its borders to vaccinated singapore travellers

re help sorry guys side tracked a bit how to go johore now vaccinated travel lane lane is what a
look so cumbersome and time consuming not practical at all actually custom only need to ensure three things a must have vaccination certificate a maintain safe distancing while inside the bus crossing custom a wear face masks throughout all other requirements such as are travel on line application long term pass prep test are all unnecessary
yes there is just too much unnecessary paperwork and or departure testing involved at least its only a rat on arrival instead of losing a a a day waiting for per result

wow is amazing to see people who have also market
it is wonderful and more win for malaysia that malaysia to open up soon for singaporeans to go in to enjoy the beauty of malaysia
what is good in malaysia food cooked with the cheap oil to offer best return for a there is a saying to know the tastiest stall in malaysia as there is always a hidden cost
keep the border close infinitely keep singapore monies within singapore to help our own sees a feb first also avert any covid brought back uprising when did johore malaysia help singapore always give united states problems of water supply aeroplane flyover borders rail her contract cancellation worst is the marine intrusion into teas singapore territorial water wanting singapore to make war bad poor neighbour
true that
close the border
do not go there law all robbers and unemployed waiting
i think city square now become kampong square
shopping also anywhere nice places miss fam victory hand important visiting
johore is not singapore problem its malaysian leaders incompetence that they did not do anything for their state and johore business just rely on singaporeans
singaporean need malaysia to work hah aha
sounds like malaysia needing singapore always
singapore not to open the border malaysia case are very high
in reality this is the least priority for both governments a state cannot just make businesses cater to only one country why locals do not go to these businesses to spend ask yourselves it was designed in the beginning for tourist only spending power get it
going back to the old ways ask the variant for permission first tourism the variant do not like unless there is a cure
there was this circulating message warning singapore not to visit johore bar as their robbers are waiting
good law hope singaporean known do pore and also increase all good in malaysia
of of
if i am not mistaken its malaysia that closes the causeway within twenty four hrs just after singapore announces that they will not close them because it affects many people
of singaporean give business to malaysia wow unbelievable than what happen to malaysian people
just johore bar not whole malaysia
xxx johore also consider big as singapore do not travel to johore bar shopping
brush johore three times the size of singapore anyway cassia a good place to bargain for food and leisure
those eateries half full because of were still in this pandemic la org if vaccinated travel lane fully open do you really want these places to become fully packed and crowded vaccinated travel lane open no more covid for you
all countries should seek damage and compensation from source of origin of wuhan viruses no benefits on dealing cd mainland chinese only misery and menace from the communists a its revile officials
job robbers waiting for rich singaporeans to rob
rob what now all going cashless
a bit bias saudi area kublai java especially premium outlets they are back to normal
we scare johore bar robbers are rubbing their hands waiting to rob
exactly
crime rate is very high in job
this is nothing new the same is also happening at the malaysia thailand border towns such as handy i sadat satin etc which relied heavily on malaysian tourists
no offence in away i agreed a if land vaccinated travel lane more relax or go back to are covid it will benefit both but the biggest concern for me is safety i personally witness a day light robbery a few years back when i was in job it happened just across the street although i look forward to the borders opening i will still hold back awhile before i visit job
but they are covering the johore singapore border majority of singaporean give of about what happened at the malaysia thailand borders maybe you should start a news coverage about the malaysia thailand borders
singaporean are not welcome by many johore an
yeah not welcome but people businesses and even politicians begging singaporeans to go back
they like singapore money not singaporean money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face
nothing new money talks in thailand its no money no honey
singaporean like malaysian currency too
it cuts both ways singaporeans loves to shop and dine in johore bar not out of love rather because of attractive exchange rates
singaporean or malaysian both like face with tears of joy
tourism is far from happening maybe two thousand and twenty five
there will not be any economy left if they remain closed forever so do not think so
the johore bar business owners relying on singaporean for sustainability are not aware that they've crossed the bridge of no return the world that they knew it is already over their businesses are standing right at the doorway of the graveyard waiting to be buried
exactly
this cyclical border shutdown lock down and booster shots was planned by the cabals to goes on for many years to come it will only end through war regime change worldwide terrorist attack and civil unrest and the masses can create this climate just by using their thoughts energy for the transformation to take effect
in all honesty i more familiar with the roads in johore bar than the roads in during now that this vaccinated travel lane is back people may simply start renting and prepping for when singaporean can cross back to normal
aim for that to happen in of of
for singapore cars to drive to malaysia i dun think it will happen before any
hong ling or quite optimistic
ninety eight yes look on the bright side at least still alive still employed and the internet still let us you connect to the world virtually you can stills little happiness
hong ling i have planned to do that in the last ten years but did not put into motion i did a bit on nyx and their universal studios

new variant omicron is arriving it can be only bring in by the vaccinated from the airport vaccinate cannot enter smirking face
wow on st day already detected on arrival positive case all the traveller are in the end are stay home quarantine speechless closed or opened also suffering some more the micron is coming very soon
the new variant is omicron not micron right
alaska its omicron of thumbs up deadlier than delta variant of thumbs up person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign person face palming male sign
pang its premature to say its deadly data currently do not suggest its deadlier then delta yet may be a blessing in disguise if it can help to eradicate delta but is less deadly
speed train please face blowing a kiss
at last home sweet home there is no best place like home
bad news indeed omicron virus vaccination done but looks like well be on the hit list of new vaccines trails again which will be the never ending story
singapore is heading for big trouble vaccinated travel lane with malaysia must be stop stop stop their government and its citizens always say that turn of the tap high risk
how come ban become bar for the japan news
congratulation a no thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hand clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
what has a no got to do with this vol
i dislike st comment section because it has been infected with dangerous virus worst than covid thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down
newborn is now two years old
please go take the vaccine shot thank you
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face to face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october
so let total infected children is of of a numbers
while they practice safety by avoidance singaporeans have to face the risks
as i have said multiples of times before safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans for you with you if you will have to accept daily can deaths and thousands community infection for it is not a solution the question is when will it reach you or our family members
he has proven to be a man of mettle the whole of singapore should rally behind sky in his noble quest for his glory and the glory of singapore
chew he had beaten china not and japan not and malaysia not he is young and handsome should be singapore idol
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
question what is the meaning of toto defense when elderly have to fall just to benefit a certain group
politics of a but not doing so is merely an excuse to avoid future blame single party is unwise and dangerous
hey ttkoh123 how you know so much info
would we be in such a situation if they were the real experts nowadays its difficult to trust anything they say
discrimination policy does not work when we can see that all fifteen deaths are fully vaccinated seniors
hello how about philippines Philippines can we travel to singapore Singapore now we are fully vaccinated my husband and me just asking thank you very much
whats so great about millennium red dot red circle singapore Singapore after all face screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming interface screaming in fear hugging face
so selfish of those traveller coming in to singapore and out bringing virus to united states and your own country never used brain to think should not travel during this time you feel happy when you travel if get infected do you think worth it very selfish of the government because of money taking your countrymen life in risk
hit the like button if you are vaccinated smiling face
the vaccinated travel lane portal does not work it does not read nor accept proof of vaccination from us i am unable to get vaccinated travel lane approval from us a load of bullshit nonsense
it is incredibly short sighted to be going on overseas tour right now
its been two years we need to start travelling again
currently there is no report of a a a variant in singapore yet but united kingdom has the a a a is amongst the countries which are on the singapore
home recovery is now the norm if you get infected you will be sent home
please return malaysia money when i paid for quarantine last time why make me quarantine a now no need pay me back malaysia hard earn money
i hope that travellers continue to take extra precautions when they travel overseas under the vaccinated travel lanes folded hands
covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant
i do not think these cleaners pay attention to the cleaning protocol mentioned in this video at the hawker centres you can either see many uncleaned tables or cleaners used the same cloth to clean the tables
who pay for the covid test kits for school children not every family is as rich as those highly paid individuals
so is now classified as a high risk country by who why too eager with open arms in welcoming foreign spreaders
most welcome your money bag to boost economy enjoy at own risk keep safe with mask on singapore is a fine city
arts are also expanded to include the you a its citizens are warned against travel to the city state due to very high level of covid of

open up for vaccinated travel lane but shut down dining in for singaporean does it make a difference
it does because we will soon have new overseas covid variants
the govt urge united states to stay at home but they let foreigners come into so did they also advise them to stay in hotel and not go out low
imported

bus stations closed disinfection mopping is
home recovery means to be deprived of it stop pretending compensate all the households and businesses for all the losses and sufferings and unnecessary lost of innocent lives and then resign
as i have said multiples of times before safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
the virus is here to stay and everyone will have to live with virus sooner or later so you close border forever

him as for you please get a proper education in english comprehension
him lawrence wong said of jul two thousand and twenty one in parliament as we do so we must expect cases to rise partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level also as we open our border for people to travel without she we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily cases numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus they are much less likely to become very ill note capitalized words why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
him law said on the twenty six jul two thousand and twenty one we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily cases because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated note the capitalized words
one hundred and twenty three sold malaysia soul to devil are you of it is fact the virus is here to stay the whole world is going for endemic stage i think you are the one not waking up
one hundred and twenty three do you know why till now you are still a pathetic loner its all because you have bad karma stop blaming others for your failures in life wake up your stupid ideas and move on

as of nineteen oct of of in total there are of of a sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy seven people deprived of
and the problem with mandate and single party is that some appeared to be threatened abused and insulted for asking reasonable and valid questions or expressing their thoughts that is a factor i will consider seriously in two thousand and twenty five and noting that percentage does not transpose directly into seats i will have to weigh on town management versus the a a majority problem also how can you blame anyone from such mediocre performance from the egg unless we see drastic improvement you know what i mean
one hundred and twenty three you are ruining your life
listen people are dying and you are worshipping and sold your soul to the devil malaysia teaching and your teaching are apparent different may god have mercy on your soul
good luck to singapore people that travel overseas at your own risk what happens if your whole family has covid what do you do spend your holiday quote into in the hotel room totally waste your money away
well like that you do not travel forever since so scare
limits not about the fear more about the inconvenience and in inflationary environment and public health division the trends towards into travel will likely change towards local focused journey
limits is not permanent situation if you can wait patiently you will find ease peace but if you wanna rush you will regret
suwanee maybe will debate in parliament first
spade suit lovely free soul spade suit waste money is not you to comment as you are not travelling
wow like that also need debate waste of resources and time look if the person need to travel then go ahead the risk is there but need to take precaution
i study the world before commenting
spade suit lovely free soul spade suit i mean is you are the traveller and the me i we is also not so why say other people waste money then why quick to judge those who travel now waste money
lies on you shall see was happening for those who a greedy rushing
those infected with covid will see long term deterioration of health
so go to your shell do not show too much fear here
four thousand daily cases in pm population is like a of a of a daily cases in china web population by proportion singapore is dangerous place to be the foreigners will get covid very soon some of them will bring in more deadly variants travel is stupid wasteful activity bad things will happen to all because of greed
welcome and good luck
what kind of purist rojas is that
what kind of purist rojas is that children compulsory biweekly art while vaccinated travel lane without quarantine reckless fake sense of care by wolves in sheep skin no wonder the international narratives are different from the min falsehoods you think
a of a new covid cases in singapore seven more deaths three una a while four taxed
as of nineteen oct of of in total there are of of a sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy seven people deprived of
the danger of the vaccinated travel lane lane doing away with quarantine it takes time for corona virus to become established in the body so a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you wont test positive later on five july two thousand and twenty one by linda geodes
so just who is not telling the truth in its entirety
as of nineteen oct of of in total there are of of a sixteen thousand three hundred and seventy seven people deprived of
so if you re vaccinated but perfectly healthy you re a threat to public safety but if you re double or triple or quadruple taxed and are still infectious with covid of no problem where did you get your education from
who eur south korea and australia already approved novara how long do we have to wait for singapore medical system
plus get your not masks and wear them everywhere modern is the best vaccine with less negative reactions
why expand the vol land and then to suddenly suspend all vaccinated travel lane between dec of jan of two thousand and twenty two just a few days later this reflects poorly on singapore is leaders in their decision making seems like knee jerk reaction rather than fact based rational decisions to me yes omicron is spreading fast but at the same time there is also evidence that microns impact is less severe than delta especially for vaccinated people why suddenly pull out vols this causes lots of disruptions to individuals as well as the public is confidence in the leaderships ability and resolve in turning covid into an endemic
singaporeans shall not take booster until all three demands are met my fellow singaporeans join me on this struggle against tyranny of the state and the pap to make it easy for singaporeans to remember and unite as one use the three finger salute to signal that you are part of this cause the day when everyone in public openly uses the three finger salute it is time for a revolution revolution of our times
one the construction and building maintenance fee in hong kong is extreme high of of higher than she when a concrete road safety barrier size about two metre a fifty cox of pm tender bill cost had about of a of a very crazy price 楊明於半山馬己仙峽道交通意外 another issue the old building maintenance of old window replacing also extreme high twelve old windows and little cement cracks on walls of an old building six stories height just that maintenance would cost a pm had very crazy price
fri omicron is stands for optimum prime
omicron already in ready i heard cases peoples come in ready it come from for fingers import cases then slowly it will come local hmm delta also started like this give me break do a simple lock down before omicron cases rise i wanna in singapore midst of bankrupt people keep saying economy economy i ask we have tons of reserve i guess a terms holding still have tons of money with a lot of investment just let in business as usual i mean for gene pass doing business import goods a trade in all of but stop those work ass first coming in temporary totally stop best stop foreigners coming in unless for exceptional we have already had a lot of foreigners to do all those cleaner job a construction we need plan a stabilise also do lock down so that minimize lives is more important the gov ask to limited size of dinning ask is it effective nope look at art a buses a look at people still kern
so if the number of cases surge again due to in of active national vaccine do you require all sporrans to get fourth booster shot compare with indonesia and cambodia and china they all use much better vac
jul open the border
its a big joke widen vaccinated travel lane to include sporrans to enter malaysia but as tickets are all sold out till next february in of of
did i hear wrongly two doses of sin vac one booster sin charm dose not equal to three doses of pfizer
the omicron variant was first detected from south africa by south african scientists why are not am not we doing anything about it
dislikes here backhand index pointing down medium light skin tone
who's latest update for december seven showed that all two hundred and twelve omicron cases documented across eighteen european union countries were either mild or without any symptoms at all so why should we once again turn our lives upside down even if millions become exposed if the symptoms are going to be like those of the common cold
who is paying for this widen healthcare i rather you not have the vol
its nice to here that can now travel but need to spend more for the required test in both country so no point of travelling
expecting the omicron to follow or script again
what if i am malaysian in singapore am i eligible to receive booster at any centre here in so
a can have malaysia booster
do not use booster that is not effective use inactivated virus which is better and safer look at indonesia and cambodia low figures
i believed omicron virus earlier already in singapore but not detected those clown clown face sitting still dons thing happen then do wasted our money
vol is very tired lives
if people still voting peoples action party in two thousand and twenty five and this are the one bringing dead to others
you search for the pile of poo bring it back into house and apply them next you work out a solution on how to clean up the pile of poo zany face any face any face nauseated face nauseated face nauseated face face vomiting clown face clown face clown face
thank you or may and all our medical professionals for your continued hard work including procuring therapeutic drugs for covid
why vaccinate young children makes no sense
its a good thing that the population of singapore is not armed or i would be nervous if i were the guy in the pink shirt
why would i travel to singapore if i have to perform a daily test for seven days in a row of yeah and omicron spells the end of the pandemic and beginning of the endemic time to let everyone get back to normal
a a no point coming here with test and spent more money rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
low if it really ends then why do so many countries want mandatory booster shots
actually already ended just they cannot stop making it serious lots of money can be made
boost or mother
whole family die

always making preparations way ahead this is what the responsible and capable spore govt is all about bravo
sorry you still will not get your or status
impact of mana in the long run is still unknown we risk our future generation of taking mana what is the percentage of the trial based on asians genetics
it is not unknown but hidden from mainstream media several countries already reported these like heart and fertility prob just read alternative news and not mainstream news
not much of a difference if vaccinated travel lane is still expensive
gov itchy get ready to have cases to go is below five hundred because everybody stay at home may once people start going back to office you will see it shoot back to of of some sick also still go back say gov never check gov zzz on the job may wont be so say ken spot check all office workers close one eye than have a party bring out the beers
below five hundred pecos those who tested positive from art tests not counted
you can live with whatever you but dons the general public consensus for the three of you you have failed why should the people listen to your same old story
no news yet still got to be very alert and careful
what about booster jab effect on obese fat and lazy people with sedentary lifestyle
vaccines are not vitamins but actually plus in take inactivate virus which is safer
when will the singapore nightlife be allowed to resume all we have done for the past two years is work ourselves to death with no real avenues to blow off steam bars clubs should slowly be allowed to open up and operate beyond the of pm curfew
well you can go to johore bar for your bars club etc to let off your steam and semen now that the land vaccinated travel lane is liberated
go geelong for can blow other things
wong life too
feet then what get covid again hama to
how do you know proof of vaccination is not fabricated if vaccinated could still contract
even those who had boosters got omicron
a when will we be in the group of eight
during this omicron cases in singapore peoples action party still want to extended and let more malaysia coming in is the one that make the storm happen when will all this clown step down
many i know no issue with this let they say
hello malaysia and spore used to be same country law it is only racial conflict that split the country spore opening up to other countries like germany is bringing the virus in
how about singapore bantam sir when opening borders
the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with co laurie acid and total community viral load can be lowered do not play dice with covid try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time
great insight
we work from home rather to save our money spent for using transport and spending for feb
sorry not interested i dun mean team a
a pm videos all uploaded so please be interested
still talking singapore is heading for big trouble
they already tell you other countries have omicron
ready for next virus i to come after omicron
art kit should be able to test omicron since it is coming
infection rate aside how deadly is this omicron
a has to try it beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes
hog you don't have to try to know

a pm yes or obvious duh
so far except for the old usually the symptom is light
how deadly is covid of not everyone is dying
so far one deaths in us
as deadly as the pandemic of disappearing cps funds
be because we do not know yet whether this viruses can because severe ness illness to people who have certain diseases like como bid or vaccinated peoples and elderly too
mako org one of the rare sensible response here yes we still don't know much about omicron
us declares first death due to omicron as hospitalizations increase and pm boris warns of a tidal wave of infections in us
wrong the person died with omicron not of omicron you need to see past the word games they play the person was a elderly cancer patient
will not it be safer to allow travelling via private cars instead of buses and trains
cannot up sell tax of you go in via own car mach
using buses to ferry people in is to allow as companies to make tons of money and to control the number of people to enter
hopeless incompetents
i want go johore bar pump cheap petrol mayan and enjoy massage
deceptions we have allie with auto bots to fight against the omicron
no point to close the country if close how long can singapore afford to close
more affordable than losing your loved ones
all collected year end bonuses reading from paper
you want them to read from palms
pap ministers also got kickbacks from parma to promote vaccines
him everything you know
him any be careful what you said after get kick into the police station
is not a lot of industries not doing well all affected by covid only government bodies making money so all of them have bonuses they must be more efficient and productive

lee all the best
him did you inform the police or crib do not talk yourself into trouble
beware ceca rats
him if not racist is there any scientific reason or logic tour comment number of reported cases in india is lower than most other countries and in a way india could have achieved herd immunity during their delta wave itself then why single out india bro
him no issue in being cautious but we must be logical and sensible
come on ceca rats really
him your just foolish
what has this to do with ceca
insurance ferry ticket art test nearly cost to of sgd low
were all tired of lock down

no one want to go singapore anyway if still need to do per test insurance this and that when arrive in singapore i wait till normal no test and test
here work place not for holidaymakers
only visitors from bantam to singapore but what about leaving singapore to go bantam still inside the vaccinated travel lane area which is bin tan and songs only
why always gave privileged to foreigners when they visit here during this period a no need for stay home notice for united states we have to contain in a resorts movement are restricted a back to singapore quarantine some more what vaccinated travel lane is this
at last is not bubble any longer thanks so we could see family there
now you go there but there not allow you go shopping just like prison in resort only what a waste of money face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
thumbs up thumbs up
have not smoked a gang gram clove cigarette in a long long time only can get there
better don't go come back deep trouble here everyday the infection is very high you are ask to stay home if you ken covid not staying in hospital nobody care for you your family member will ken too so better stay home keep safe don't play play clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
must close border until end of the year more safety for singapore
a very capable spore govt thumbs up thumbs up
this entire vaccine is total is the vaccine does not work on any of the covid nineteen variants also you can be fully vaccinated and still spread covid the entire mandate is total crap
thanks you
uncles will be over joy as to is damn too expensive even beer hostess spa aunties have inflated their services
pap is the best
very good news party popper
burn money plus time just for a neighbouring trip totally not worth it
if it is just for a holiday forget it returning to singapore goes thru the same quarantine for seven days which cost thousands
indonesians make singaporean life so hard
open la so many restrictions last tim go there no need visa all why for short term need visa
when covid dis pear from world we miss go singapore again eat food and traveller
rules travelling to bantam and bin tan could be relaxed but returning to singapore will definitely be a total hassle for sure do not want to be locked up for days and paying thousands when returning to singapore the move is designed to boost tourism in indonesia and singapore government will never be bothered to help indonesia where they will claim that it is to safeguard singapore but will continue to allow tons of india indians in which is the main reason for the spread of covid in singapore
nobody will go the usual people going there are cheapskates and quite poor with these costs its almost certain the ports will remain desolate because these people will not be able to afford it anyhow plus travelling space is limited and not the entire islands are open to tourists its commendable that the indonesian government is making the effort but its not going to work yet
she seven days when coming back is a big obstacle wait for vaccinated travel lane sea to open
stupid and cannot fathom or leaders make such arrangement
what has what is the point of this travel build to bantam because we can only be allowed only vacation in songs bantam island not other place in bantam island except songs what a waste of time going to bantam only restricted only at songs bantam only thumbs down thumbs down thumbs down
as indonesian malaysia message for you singaporeans do not forget say thanks to bill gates and the gang thumbs up medium light skin tone
mistress time mating season
better do not open stay at singapore better cannot go anywhere
only within the bin tan resort or bantam resort area no allowed to go anywhere and to pm per test all cost at three hundred sgd and come back singapore ken quarantine some more not worth the travel or holiday
yes not worth waste money we cannot travel around bantam back singapore quarantine some more face with open mouth
hmm so the journalist or delegates went to bin tan for this meeting so when they come back do they serve she
ahmad why is it not required so the covid virus do not attack journalist nor diplomats or those on special arrangements
as i thanks for reply they believe via is is not human any way your right
ahmad not asking if i am right or wrong just a question why is there a different treatment for normal visitor and this special people that is the biggest mystery
as i must be an equal but the question mark will be remain for ever and ever
ahmad so the lope hole is not to be a normal visitor hah aha having a status is more than enough to fight covid even vaccine is useless
so much hassle yet can only stay at the resort
its time like this you see your real friends
who will travel triple per test insurance this cost alone is about of a haven include the boat cost which will cost more for vol
yes malaysia parents have a chance to go indonesia
really shows the intelligence for policy makers to think that singaporeans would rather spend of a for per tests to fro and travel to bantam bin tan for a a days holidays and then return for seven days stay home instead of travelling to further countries for longer holidays
cannot buy dried shrimp and anchovies only allow to move within resort area
do not waste money and effort law so many restrictions and protocols to follow unless so desperate to travel by all means go waste money on to go singapore per bantam per then back bantam per singapore per then hotel food and anything will cost a bomb better wait for normal travel
what a useless update for what go bantam if cannot go anywhere only bin tan island only better i waste malaysia money go sent a more better better not need to open the border
singapore giving up the indonesian air space is the reason indonesia is allowing travel in by singaporeans covid is just a farce to use to subjugate people suddenly it is not an issue anymore hama what an obvious farce
why do not you guys just ask for money directly instead of fooling united states with words such as quarantine reopening she per and bubble
wait guide we have to quarantine foreigners no quarantine coming back here make money we have to fork money some more got go to school or not
do not trapped in the pharmacy business just wait and patient let us the big country which have big pharmacy at war price
it indonesia who have been separated since the lock down in of of do have a heart to consider their swift reunion red heart
those enjoy the benefit of both worlds
do not forget say thanks to by fact and the gangs thumbs up medium light skin tone
as a gothic i will provide a travel experience when visiting indonesia for seven months i will tell you honestly because i done talking about the whole area of indonesia tourist attractions in indonesia are crazy saved in the heart explore more than fifty tourist attractions in indonesia then you will know that indonesia is very amazing
do you know about in bali
a i do not know the place but malaysia favourite tourist attractions in bali are the lake and mount batu
yes you have to have adventurous soul to travel to indonesia skyscrapers shopping malls casino etc is not indonesia re from the mining industry not fine
in krak but its true what you say the number of tourists in indonesia is relatively small because it is only ranked with when compared to malaysia thailand or singapore in southeast asia but whatever it is i like nature tourism in indonesia because it is different in each region and it makes me have an amazing experience and impression yeah this is no joke
cordelia cream ora its called as eco tourism what we indonesia has strong value is nature tradition culture etc sky rappers is boring just man made nothing compare to god made
cordelia cream ora i believe you even me as indonesian always amazed by the nature have you been swimming with whale sharks it was the highlights of malaysia life in of of its a beautiful tropical islands too
in krak I have visited natural attractions in kalimantan named ram bed wat and send saying
in krak there are too many natural tourist attractions in indonesia i know more than thousands in total therefore i only visited a few but i wanted to return to visit the ones i had never been to
i do not think singaporeans in general go to indonesia to see skyscrapers
seven thousand seven hundred and twenty two i done not interested
seven thousand seven hundred and twenty two the typical tourist of each country is different for example like me as a gothic person it is more directed to nature tourism and studying it because for me it has a very different satisfaction when compared to man made tourism if only for skyscrapers or other man made no need to travel far because every country has it but it is different from nature tourism every country has its level for indonesia i judge that natural tourist attractions are unique different from each region and many
don't make sense at all most singapore visitors go there for short getaways so it is still too much hassle to go through for three days of vacation or actually a a since half day is needed in indonesia to take the per test i expect it to fail
face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy everything during this pandemic do not make sense victory hand
act rely all this is both bin one a rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing white flag white flag white flag white flag white flag white flag
but ferry fares sgd and hotels sky rocket one trip at least of a burned making you pay for their losses i would wait
the game they are playing money shift from ordinary people to the filthy rich more people are suffering but ironically more billionaires are created victory hand
when johore bar is covid free i go there walk for hrs is free money thing sorry johore bar is the only place i ever would go for free only shopping does cost sent a is malaysia place to go for now but not frequent quarantine nah not going until covid free
hmm do this place on dream cruise too
even with and shot and booster shot the regulation is remain unchanged people still being locked in one country this covid is a bio weapon to speed up digitisation and and introduce future meta verse into our society remember without covid people will not bother invest in not cry to block chain etc this is what they called master plan
hail to all those who are inquisitive enough to investigate on their own hail to all those who are steadfast enough not to submit to coercion threat
asst face with medical mask thanks to bill gates tucker berg and the gangs
trust me better do not take this stupid trap advantage this is all to make citizens travellers as an utmost reason virus is spreading more this is all hidden political agendas at the end who at fault normal people
putting all the restrictions and inconvenience aside i appreciate that indonesia is opening up to allow our people to travel there hopefully more travel corridors would gradually open up as time goes by
wish they wouldn't talk so much and just breakdown the costs contingencies sop etc
limited movement to only the bin tan resort area what a joke
it will be wise to avoid leisure travelling until the protocol has revert back to the are covid era well keep our money by sitting down to watch their tourism industry and full scale economic collapse and then followed by a repeat of may of civil unrest
exactly indeed
who says no covid end game who chief terms
its easy to spot the truth because truth will never change while the who or fact and most world leaders are flip flopping with their negatives judge yourself victory hand
while our normal lives have been paused by covid our aging does not appreciate any effort to get people back living to the fullest while keeping the bottom line severe illness and death low
you this scared about influenza too steeple like you did not bat an eye for ebola
the bottom line is we will never back to normal when majority still think that this is a pandemic human have been living with variants of corona viruses for centuries but the only difference to this one is it was engineered with fear
go no quarantine whats the point
its pandemic victory hand face with tears of joy
stupid rules and protocol confirmed no one to visit bantam bloody hell to buy insurance fully vaccinated to take per make united states stupid what they want to collect your beside that under table be careful bro
good for those who have families across the border a time to reunite during coming festival
uncles need to charge their batteries to here too expensive
most uncles here cannot endure their chicks energy they laughs looking at our uncles size and stamina a yamaha
go there of but go back home downcast face with sweat
so indonesia thinks three days stay will not contact covid of hence the hope that returning singaporeans need not she
all the tiki uncle rushing to bantam soon
like your father
not worth going there even are covid low the ferry and immigration alone was a hassle imagine with multiple checkpoints and per testing etc
with the mask on alone makes me no mood already
not worth for you but there are many seeing this as way to reunite with their love ones
indonesia is i gear country people are friendly
great living with virus in a safe manner
Indonesia red heart red heart red heart smiling face with heart eyes
pm lee going bin tan for retreat today so we no need quarantine when return to singapore so simple logic
he at home seven days sleeping can
too much of a hassle not gonna travel and pay extra for the per art tests and rising ferry fees i wish travelling can all go back to normal without all these testings and additional fees and inconveniences it will take a long time before everything will go back to normal
not a chance in asia you should move to the west to actually live a are covid life best if the us
hmm that might be possible in two thousand and twenty four
that's just you but this is how it is now
we are in asia we all have
do not forget say thanks to by fact and the gangs thumbs up medium light skin tone the worlds will normal if any some country at war for hard reset the minds of people and the old source of profit war is racket since syria and afghanistan playgrounds has closed
this is good for people who have husband and wives over there but the total cost to travel over there already reach about of a

of trust me everyone will
if they do very soon there will be lots of cases in either singapore or indonesia or both and they will stop the arrangement just like what they did with vaccinated travel lane flights
welcome to the new normal do not complaint if you truly believe the pandemic experiment human behaviour we are the victims tax or in tax victory hand
hama one sided announcement again

the worst prime minister of malaysia no compassion nor dignity he failed twice miserably

in malaysia a lot of radical races still calling singapore a betrayal and do not be like singapore hah aha look where is singapore now no worry malaysia corruption leader still rich and citizen still stupid and poor and still blaming other good job malaysia

i very much agree that its english level but the sad part is our english education is so far behind and our malaysian leaders still do not realize the importance in mastering english especially when those conservative politicians are in power a reporter was even verbally abused by a minister and his assistant recently just because she was asking questions in english
malaysia ranked and for many years and currently ord in english proficiency across asia so not so far behind plus you don't need to be advanced in english to be a developed nation just look at japan china south korea or even indonesia proud of their language
listen to our pm speech then think again
yup it including those minority talents that working overseas it brings the ranking up
pang singapore english is not talk nonsense about malaysia because malaysia boles means malaysia can
boo yeah still nothing to be ashamed not his first language english is not a measure of intelligence i still believe he is not a great leader for malaysia but still language is not how you measure thing
even or sultan of johore spoke out against this in malaysians forced to speak bahama malaysia he said how can malaysians compete when all their important lessons are in malay he also said its like living in the middle ages
on they are chinese educated also the way they speak is the mainstay of their jobs making people laugh the crude tolkien our spore govt is trying to improve the way we speak without english as a sporran i do agree our english is good but not up to par i listen to some hong mongers they speak english so well
up to you
english was spoken by many during the is late is something happened and the powers that be started to insist medical students be taught in bharat it was a disaster since medical staff started to migrate to australia no canada and other countries book were translated into the javanese lhasa which is full of sanskrit and tamil malaysians could not master what is literate or high grammar and vocabulary quickly enough indians and chinese had to privately educate their kids so they could keep the country on the map politicians like dumb down malays beck they can steal from the country malays deserve good education they should demand english
i would like to say that our pm can speak very well in english as i am able to fully understand what they said in the meeting the gist of communication is to let listeners understand the meaning of the speech that all and is as simple as that 所有類型的疾病都不像戰爭那麼糟糕 of of

yea that's the mentality of you pal always avoid the shortcoming and keep telling yourself that when there's an issue boles la take la malaysia the boles land means boles however sad it may sounds that's the quality of our leader and pal no wonder malaysia are so much behind singapore look at how far singapore is ahead of us when singapore independence from malaysia they started with nothing but small island while malaysia have huge land blessed with strategic location in the region with the west of peninsular malaysia borders the straits of malacca and natural resources but the quality of leaders not so much its just sad seeing malaysia going backwards under these clowns leadership and the rabat are still feeling good about it
thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up bravo

england trained both father and son

thanks sir smiling face with smiling eyes
the good outcome of this pandemic is that both countries is closer than ever before since of of
visually terrible looking oral care for the oriental guy definitely need to see a dentist and orthodontist maybe need a higher salary as he appears too destitute to afford an appointment to see both professionals
selma for the uninitiated like you anyone holding the office of a head of govt has retinue of staff including interpreter to deal with delegates not speaking bahia delay or english
she madurai huh why would he need a translator for reading out a press release its a lot of malaysians like to nitpick on petty things when there are more crucial issues that needs solving
so true i also cannot understand why these politicians make a big fuss over the use of by when they sprout utter rubbish whenever they open their mouth it is sure to rile the right thinking citizens nothing is in their mind but to create chaos and discontent by may be the official language but does that mean you should restrict others from using it in official functions and for the pm to impose restrictions is unbelievable all the pms by him have used english as per situation english is an international language and all literary books are in english by is full of words borrowed from tamil hindi english itself and god knows from what else so why the fuss over the use of english it is just too bad that some political people do not want to upgrade themselves to be marketable internationally nor locally energy should be channelled towards improving the economy and inviting foreign investors to invest here indecent talk of racial and religious issues has already chased foreign investors to singapore thailand and india as long as bigots sit in important posts malaysia will slide to the rock bottom of the ladder
was in akan sem a lawyer pro english grinning face with sweat
rolling on the floor laughing
would these happen if marathi is still in charge maybe the border will be close permanently
thankfully that old fart is no longer in charge
maybe malaysia prime minister needs to improve his english
replying to not abdul shaker in fact there is no purpose to compare which pm can speak better english they are not english language teachers and they are not here to teach english language many china citizens cannot even utter proper english sentences and yet they are surviving well in so people from various as an countries that do not speak english are also able to work and live in so the ability to communicate in english does make life easier in so likewise knowing malay language make your life easier in malaysia
i very much agree that its english level but the sad part is our english education is so far behind and our malaysian leaders still do not realize the importance in mastering english especially when those conservative politicians are in power a reporter was even verbally abused by a minister and his assistant recently just because she was asking questions in english
of louie loo i of a leo yahoo of a nah i think yous not even the most spoken language in the world
ayah jugal oak nawab in hama agreed that the state of corruption is of greater concern also agreed that the abusive nature of the minister is more apparent than his command of english however english is also the lingua france of the globalized world not so much of whether it is a western invention or how fine we are doing without it but rather due to its homogeneity english is practical and usable in international and business affairs much like the wearing of to shirt and jeans a western invention bow its popularity works in a similar fashion pun intended think of english as a tool nothing more the current president of the united nation is abdul a shah id a maldivian at birth he is able to deliver his speeches fluently in english despite it not being his first language many past presidents are also not
super male to have this guy as our prime minister straight away exposed the quality of both country is leader by comparison god bless malaysia under this guys leadership
so low quality
natural input there are not there to compare english proficiency
january by all means defend him all you want the fact that his english sucks is undeniable and malaysia is a multiracial country being a leader of malaysia whereby you can only speak your mother tongue is so unacceptable and instead of improving his english he choose to strengthen bahama malay that's just show how much of a person he is what a pm coming out from kampong that's just sad stop living in a cave stick your head out and look at the world its two thousand and twenty one now countries and pal are constantly improving all i can see about malaysia is going backwards with all these rubbish politicians and still feeling great about themselves i love malaysia and its hurtful seeing malaysia rotten under these clowns governance god bless malaysia
again you miss the point but trade with other countries are burgeoning
come on malaysia give or pm a chance hes trying his best love pm singapore smiling face with hearts Gambia
its lingua france is malay unlike singapore which is english he could just speak in by as pm lee is an intelligible speaker of malay as all per all the past singapore pms like go cook tong and lee juan guys need to chill out and look at the bright side for once
low does not he said want to improve by position then why he is using english during the event
the flag wrong side la
of leaders should learn from pm lee his curiosity yesterday or lee pronounced omicron as to improved much we hope out future leaders would be as curious and self questioning as pm lee singapore needs leaders who are intensely curious and always trying to improve themselves

hello its two thousand and twenty one already and almost of of you still living in a cave is it countries and peoples are dealing with each other we all are interconnected in this world and english is the international language shouldn't that proficiency in english the most basic requirements as a leader of a country yes compare malaysia with indonesia but don't compare malaysia with china korea or japan malaysia don't have the power and international level of influences as compared to those countries as sad as it may sounds when you are a sol potato pal and countries expects you to follow their standards and converse in english when malaysia is as strong as china korea or japan then nobody will bats an eye when the leader speaks in his own language hell he can even talk nonsense like donald trump and pal will still accept it expressionless face expressionless face expressionless face
its just sad that this is the quality of our leader god bless malaysia
wrong its not just english its the technician in the speech singapore pm can speak english chinese malay tamil singapore ministers are highly qualified and under a meritocracy system malaysia only be hasa malay and only malays dominate the country through racial system this is the difference

what is the meaning of
agreed there is no need to compare we should proud of our own language but not to forget other language as second or more language
chang yeah right for a multicultural country its taught as a second language not any
males nobody denies the importance of english economy
do you know that once upon a time before is our english equally good with singapore the change of curriculum and medium of instruction in the is and the implementation of racial based quota system contributed to deterioration of mastering the language do not forget that english is still the most important language in malaysia than bahama in majority dominant field in this country a a law medical accounting finance and in private sectors the actual fact is you have to know bahama if you got to deal with government sector korea japan china are well known for their hard work community a historical culture and their contribution in research and development especially in science and technology field that is the reason they are proud of their mother tongue
malay is not a language of international diplomacy and trade

omicron could change everything crying face
standby for another outbreak
was this need a thousand dlr insurance they also need to meet their family there
this is another scam be honest in singapore side are singaporeans ready for this scam this scam is the most important thing for both countries who care about the rabat or the country

still talking singapore is heading for big trouble stop vol the malaysian government and it peoples always threatened singapore to turn off the tap no water supply to singapore

the one thing that i must agree malaysians food superb face savouring food
if i am a singapore or i go back malaysia via vol do i have to at least stay fourteen days in malaysia before i can come back to singapore
if those malaysian were to miss their country so much probably they can stay back at malaysia for longer period of time
those malaysian has a job to do if they stay longer how are they supposed to support their family
these malaysians chose to stay in singapore for work reasons and they have been there pretty long not being able to see their families and this is the only good opportunity that they have to see their families again without going through two weeks of quarantine which costs them money and if you have faith in your government than believe that they made the right decision
buses can spread infection more efficiently so they chosen the buses
within eight mind all tickets sold out for the past thirty days face with rolling eyes face with rolling eyes face with rolling eyes face with rolling eyes
ice website says art is only valid when certified by a registered lab why then are we testing ourselves by the millions everyday if they are neither certified nor valid

great news thanks to the responsible and capable spore govt for taking a calibrated approach to opening up
capable yet covid cases of daily low
dear god just zip it already total is at work
tee you then is
tee sorry singapore govt how along is based on science
limit is just exhausting on top of listening to lawrence a his team excuse explained themselves away every other day
him just stand down already face with rolling eyes
its just the beginning
so many died already since we started going forward in the past a months
this is making me reconsider going to korea in april seems like a hassle
and now of dec of south korea is having its worst outbreak since pandemic thank you vol i guess
do not you really know yet that vaccinated people infect each other and transmit the corona virus how is it possible
singapore is spreading virus through vol first germany now a korea both countries are having its worst outbreak since vaccinated travel lane was established a a month ago
need electronic visa I am travelling for seven days only
koreans performances in tokyo olympics
well we might as well maybe a few more months waiting to travel as what you seen here such troublesome getting everything paper in order and the waiting in long time will so tiring especially for the senior citizens unless there some matter important things to do then okay but if going for a holidays better wait a few more months rather having situation like refugees chaotic trying to go somewhere
few more months then omicron
it is a good move to have vaccinated travel lane with south korea a lot of people like to have a break after two years of the trauma living with covid is like this
too much trouble but south korea is still safer than india at least i don't have worry about malaysia daughter being gang rape on a public bus
last year before the existence of the covid vaccine a a of patients were covid patients but after the vaccine existed almost all patients were detected covid the majority of patients in the hospital were those who had already completed the vaccination ards lung injury lung injury pneumothorax lung damage due to forced ventilator machine all of this is due to medical protocols not the result of covid disease
so never imposes full lock down
so troubles on downcast face with sweat next year then plan no time to do paperwork face with tears of joy
two thousand and twenty five maybe when all this nonsense is gone and things go back to how they were in of of otherwise do not bother
in short unless you are a bit of a self hating samoa racist with little or no self respect dignity but lots of time to waste lots of money energy and resources to waste enjoy hassle agitation irritation misery in general the madness absurdity keeps on going the brave new world of covid of comply conform obey and believe or else
there no flu in korea
scientists mystified wary as africa avoids covid disaster eighteen nov of your mainstream media try to hide the fact that covid mysteriously out of sight in the african continent
i am visit seoul from city of manila taipei and singapore sec in two thousand and twenty two
a western australian police officer has been admitted to the hospital following an adverse reaction to the covid of vaccine which saw her suffer a stroke caused by blood clots this is a good illustration of the brain make up of tax fanatic
restrictions will be totally lifted in the next upcoming year towards ord quarter of of going now is no point many place and shops still closed if you exit seoul in seoul also not everything is open and too many restrictions still in place better to wait til mask off

vaccinated lives matter limitation for vaccinated travels is to protect the public why then do we keep on importing omicron covid of and many more covid of next year i think it is not to overwhelm the medical services and facilities with more than one hundred imported cases will it not flood the medical facilities will they pay for the medical expenses just like the innocent vaccinated citizens who pays taxes serve national services pays double interest for housing loans save money for govt through cps
us indonesians used to look singapore effective handling of covid with envy i guess that is not the case anymore
did not the public tell you vaccinated travel lane is foolishness only for the money whatever happened to the useless change connect plan if these are effective why is the infection continuing
high level eth booster coming soon
well be playing pandemic for another year
if you did not buy return tax bye bye he to wait till jan of who is going to bear the cost for staying in the opposite country the sudden change of law created unnecessary cost on top of daily art pleading face most of united states are all just employees we do not print money face without mouth face without mouth see no evil monkey
the ministry task force is a joke singaporeans do not respect the mtg everyone knows this
only way to slow or stop virus is to stop travelling vac do not work gov knows but in order to earn money ask you jab tell you can go norm wen jab but you will see there will be no norm as all tax liao
those parents in order to go back malaysia take risk of tax their kids got played out low
is there still a necessary for travelling these days huh thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face thinking face with the vaccinated travel lane in force and all who are vaccinated are allowed to travel luggage around the world globe showing Americas globe showing Europe Africa for vacations right person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign person shrugging male sign person shrugging person shrugging medium light skin tone female sign this isn't the right and smart formula either omicron is here to stay think koreans please wake up your ideas light bulb man doomsday isn't too far from reach of thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
millennium think koreans in red dot red circle macula kit singapore siNgaporesiNgaporesiNgaporesiNgaporesiNgaporesiNgaporesiNgapore are all doomed all over malaysia Malaysia states is affected by massive flooding and yet think koreans are still thinking about travelling to and fro to malaysia Malaysia states where are your brains brain brain brain brain think koreans living in red dot red circle macula kit singapore siNgaporesiNgaporesiNgaporeisland desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island desert island
those travelling to malaysia are mostly malaysians working in singapore who have not seen their families for long period of time that is the main purpose of this vaccinated travel lane about to let families or long distance relationship to be together
if there was a contraceptive vaccine yes people it really is that stupid
excellent analogy to wake up those deeply hypnotized by vaccine snake oil salesman
with the increased and imported spikes in covid of cases where did the omicron and other viruses come from who brought them in it cannot be the vaccinated since they are not allowed to travel hmm why are they discriminated then
then why allow vaccinated travel lane into singapore all affected are coming in to singapore to aggravate the situation disgusting
only complain complain please la pathetic
please la who are ask you all to go overseas now and now changes complain please la
today do one tomorrow do two another day did three which to follow
what has what is the point of asking people to take covid test before taking a flight if the infected are able to board the plane
sara sounds familiar another anthony face speaking here in singapore
of off la why vaccinated travel lane still need so many effing testing the new procedure makes no logic and sense stupid govt
to live with virus or not this is a really hard decision to make while we are proclaiming to learn to live with the virus we are not doing that
not surprised to hear this
must close again six month singapore much better and tour is can not a try until one year two thousand and twenty three
that ore govt
completed disappointed for such decision
saran sounds familiar another anthony face speaking here in singapore
so singapore government completely lied about living with covid as well i wonder if their citizens want to shut off to the outside world or open up
cannot stop omicron only slow it a bit
instead of temporary shutting down the vaccinated travel lane when omicron was detected we are now paying the price due to our reckless govt lucky the virus is less severe than delta otherwise there will be more deaths
it will be the usual relaxing and tightening cycle to propel united states into the new world order agenda
well said that exactly their playbook from day one
the masses will be accepted into the matrix of the danial by leaving behind their culture race religion caste social status etc that is the motivation were experiencing now
so during this period till with january are we still allow to travel out of singapore
full flip government la want to open don't want to open kana said
this guy is repeating the word like dozens of times in this interview he must have repeated this word million times a year take this positive feedback OF hand
very observant psychologically speaking this kind of person is either seriously lacking confidence or in extreme case pathological liar
don't you know that millennium think koreans in red dot red circle macula kit singapore siNgaporesiNgaporesiNgapore island desert island is doomed nonetheless don't bother to think about any revivals of the millennium red dot red circle singapore Singapore anymore whats done cannot be undone millennium red dot red circle singapore Singapore is already hopeless and worthless all the government wants is nothing but cash money bag money dollar banknote true and factual
this is quite ridiculous open and close open and close if booster is so effective why are we closing again these knee jerk reactions are disruptive as long as our leaders are not decisive we will forever running in this covid loop
exactly just like a drunken man who lost his way could not get back home keep wandering and looping with his bottle on hand at the liquor shop
we should welcome not stop beaming face with smiling eyes
the omicron is very transmissible but it is not more dangerous than delta do not panic
nothing is certain yet its just to avoid panic
omicron still because death
just summarising pm what you read in media
first and foremost do you have a reliable test to identify it in the first place the same applies to per test as well
if you have any underlying medical condition well you have to pray hard to survive
its of can use sampan row to selangor no need land or flight
now having a booster shot every three months is a high possibility from two thousand and twenty two onward malaysia concern is will we ever become addicted to the vaccines will we have withdrawal symptoms if we stop taking the vaccines
simple be yourself
booster shots mach am apple iphone one to iphone of akan dating
just malaysia humble opinion so who is on the winning side is pretty obvious no matter how many variants appear in the world
valid questions which they do not know what is the impact on our immune system i have remained unix throughout can you stay strong its doable stop following their stupid orders
yes that's true i agree with you completely leslie him to the morons from the peoples action party union they only know how to enforce crap shit rules because their families aren't affected at all they have never even spare a thought thought balloon about the commoners suffering here in worthless red dot red circle singapore SingaporeSingaporeSingaporeSingapore
it has been the peoples action party way of governing
a lot singapore citizens do not realize that the peoples action party government always pass laws and things go wrong they change
they are always on trial and error like a person who fail his driving license test but somehow got it through some means has no clue on the direction to any destination no gas device to guide just going round and round in circle rolling on the floor laughing
utah haiti natural good analogy they lost their way like a blind fold man
saran sounds familiar another anthony face speaking here in singapore
a law obviously everything in this world is trial and error if something go wrong you obviously want to change to improve the condition then what just leave as is to make the problems worse if you are any better then you govern ourself law i think everyone die all
utah haiti natural do you think the human race is already so smart at this age and we can prevent anything from happening everything in this world is trial and error what we are experiencing now is very new it is not like the cars virus back then no one in this world can play god not everything is determined we can only learn and improve ourselves through trial and error singapore is actions against this virus is already one of the best there is the entire world has to offer if you are not happy then you are free to go to other countries where their leaders are much more ambitious and do whatever they think is right and end up killing thousands governments can make mistakes but their decisions are often well thought out with many people and there are more pros and cons plus and minuses and trade offs that we still need to consider something that your little mind cant think of before making that comment
re destroying their own peoples action party next generation as well no proper schooling say without proper training for two years every day fooling people just go online peoples action party is in for a long decay and certain death
obviously some pap pie lapdogs believe they had tremendous reserve that can last them for hundreds generation to come without even have to work or ensure all spore citizens have gainful employment without all this unwarranted disruption in the name of covid that is where their arrogance come from
is happen to the transit flight in the is place a allow to transit
stop cross border travels stops the spread simply if you know of a place that has the virus don't go there if or there don't leave
of stress
mtg has failed again on the timelines of the execution sloppy job yielding abysmal results
omicron five weeks in us ask cases and how many so close the world jab little kids how very proportionate
aida those who hungry to travel and looking for hell please don't complain la clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
gibraltar more than of fully vaccinated of bolstered cases spiking again portugal and israel are also on the uptrend for new cases in a particular football team there are a mix of vaccinated and vaccinated players in the same training ground and same dressing room given the same environment and time frame some vaccinated players never got infected whereas some fully vaccinated players caught the virus there is no consistency to either the vaccines or covid of altogether keep this in mind and let us observe further
while vaccinated may still get the virus this is because it is not of a effective the vaccines are much more effective against preventing death or serious illness than remaining vaccinated
a even so enough data already showed the risks are also very very low for vaccinated pal especially for generally healthy bodies perhaps the urgent push for mass vaccination is to cover up the inconsistency i just mentioned above ism not against the vaccination so far if a person is convinced to take it but the direct and indirect mandates are seriously unethical
a two month account
good observations instead of focusing on one self immune system assuming every single person has aids and with that assumption forcing or coercing everyone to accept the experimental jab
hartman that right the media and govt have been turning our awareness away from ourselves sadly this is a mountainous habit that is to put excessive significance in the external perception they are assuming and made united states forget about the abilities of our own immune system
you know what i gonna say right just say this will make you surrender to adversity and accept your fate
late very late incompetents in charge expect pratt flipping
can you recall how many times they have been flipping i lost count face with tears of joy at least since or long hoe nam appears on channel news asia since april or may and other pad plastered experts follow
hartman since january two thousand and twenty till today almost two years of flipping
aida don't worry la no need to control since you want to open let it be expected of malaysia con will increase if the figure goes up singaporean will suffer again here anyway there is no christmas and chinese new year la rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
shouldn't have open in the first place no foresight even the blind can see for trade purposes yes trading the lives of the poor for the rich
i prefer the bus company to refund the ticket cost hard to get the way back ticket from of jan of of onward for sure pouting face outing face outing face outing face outing face outing face outing face outing face outing face outing face
we can always have para again to control omicron spread not bad also
bic news the great resignation wave millions of americans quit their jobs saying they feel liberated and that the covid has shown there is more to life than slogging this quit trend is spreading in canada and europe too
please do away with the countdown its a waste of time
countdown to tyranny two thousand and twenty two
living with can
this virus has the ability to mutate into more harmful variants unlike malaria from anopheles mosquito as the breeding grounds which can be controlled and destroyed i am saying therefore this virus must be treated with zero tolerant and human cannot coexist with it for example from wuhan virus to delta variant which have already killed millions given time the mutation may wipe out human
i am saying the usage of the word is misleading singaporeans for others selfish gains while the elderly are dying everyday
as i have said long time ago and its outright risky endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure
one hundred and twenty three you think covid can be eradicated like malaria or polio hah
bridge firstly go get a proper education in english comprehension
sixty five omicron covid cases detected in singapore single party is unwise and dangerous
as i have said long time ago and its outright risky endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure
basically if you choose and had to travelled through vol no need to complain basically this is the post pandemic travelling pattern or sop else forget about travel visible fighting against invisible can and will never be easy no human on this earth right now right here knows or can know how the next moment can be upon the mercy of the virus unless really urgent and critical do not waste time and money as inconvenience there will be
the border measures against this virus are futile we should not let this virus control our lives it is endemic and is going to stay with united states forever just like the cold or flu i quickly booked malaysia flight today while vaccinated travel lane tickets are still being sold
a now is pandemic not endemic
these days when peoples action party says i want to laugh
cop for the word
singaporeans will remember the vols despite the emergence of new variants stop pretending and evading
do not travel for frustrated visitors to so face with medical mask
hah aha coming soon eth booster on the way for adults rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughingsyringesyringesyringesyringe this is definitely some kind of experiment already
active is preventive measures while reactive is waiting for things to happen despite worldly information
reactive ministers what is the objective cheap human lives or enterprise business more important
regarding the drugs vaccine i heard goes thru damask unless i heard wrongly malaysia question is why cannot govt buy direct instead of passing through another middleman hand do they have private investors funds manage by tease are the drug vaccine one of such investor funds
also why award to term ask and not goes thru tendering process and they will say term ask own by govt but then salary cannot review or declare and secret then they say is private transparency or opaque
that single party is unwise and dangerous
pap is playing with fire
that the way it should be like agenda

jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
good job close country two year to travel or until covid nineteen dis pear
living with covid of virus climbs up we duck down and vice versa
action should have been taken as soon as omicron surfaced
this is a nice so shook
so everyone has to stay at home to celebrate christmas
what has what is happening to the high efficacy western vaccines org
boring
a bit slow to react and to curb the spread of omicron person face palming female sign
do not freeze people complain singaporeans really love to complain
too late too little
why was i forced to take vaccination then middle finger
in light of the forecaster anticipated spread of omicron mayhap about two weeks too late to reduce the vaccinated travel lane flows the reaction was unnecessary on hindsight
on off on off open close open close
so sad vaccinated travel lane on hold after things were looking up wanted to visit seoul or istanbul singapore malaysia should try form a bubble its only separated by a pm walkway
unfortunately malaysia cannot handle any epidemic nor natural disasters else the bubble could have been formed long ago
man singapore is better in handling natural disaster does not rely helps from neighbouring countries singaporeans voted reliable political party as the government
new scam in process vaccine for what get just heal most die of of a percent get of
omicron already occur when the land vaccinated travel lane occur and how stop
they did not hold their nerve so much for living with it good thing they can still draw their salary to fear of money coming in rel not brought back how to run businesses

many poor countries also as if nothing is happening
african nations also dismissed his ebola tuberculosis polio measles can is breakfast in bed
god bless singapore
right move
open close open close open close what they learn a lesson after the outbreak
thank you channel news asia for this report on the vaccinated travel lane situation in singapore due to omicron from me and the gospel music ministry i serve in also thank god one of our recent songs a swift intervention to end this pandemic
singapore making the same mistake like the previous variants then blame unix
do you have any better suggestions this virus is tricky and approaches must be nimble
is no point when you still have vaccinated travel lane travel
what when even a kid can see it coming import over local
why cannot we just stop flaunting to the whole world that we have got everything to break out of this pandemic just to go back in it deeper than before spare a thought for the healthcare workers
what makes you think its for showing the world anything your way of thinking is so skewed
his thinking is justifiable considering our sop kept changing from dining in groups of two to five multiple times as soon as the cases drop the government relaxed the rules and declared that it as an endemic phase only to tighten the grip again when newer variants are discovered this trend of repeatedly going back and forth with the sop will continue in the future they should not rush and move in a steady pace instead
cabbage that does not mean that the policies are made to show the world or to flaunt anything policies change all the time especially in this pandemic which is very unpredictable should any policy be rigidly unchanged despite the changing conditions simply to show that the initial policy was perfect
ridiculous they just do not learn or adapt the virus is less virulent and too fast to contain plus people are vaccinated but treated the same as if vaccine never existed
stay home is the best
i think is a bit too late that time discover first case of omicron in singapore must already stop the travel some may had got omicron but without symptoms going out to eat and spread to others with mostly haven't got their booster shot is quite dangerous
this is a continuous relaxing and tightening cycle to transit united states into the new world order agenda anyway be prepared for a caber pandemic which will made covid of look like a walk in the park
should have happened earlier and listen from all experts but not only the western experts or else omicron will be called ohm god
she is sitting in a high rise office building you really think this travel companies to ways would feel any pinch if this safety measures is taken off course not
is this what their so called looks like face with tears of joy

beng kos vote for me if i win i will make it illegal for anyone to gather around food stalls and cancel all dining in outlets
why ada needs fifty five years to disclose pfizer vaccine information to the public while only took three months to review and approve what to hide here
nice for opening smiling face with smiling eyes i like singapore
taiwan halts and dose biotech vaccinations for ages of of amid concerns of myocarditis cases of myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis inflammation of the outer lining of the heart have been reported after but vaccination of children between twelve and seventeen years of age according to us statistics the risk of youths experiencing myocarditis after receiving the second but dose is ten times higher than after the first dose channel news asia reported
opening of causeway border is too much of a risk to take controlling and handling the traffic volume with detail checks is highly impossible hope government can seriously this decision not creating another regret again now with opening of various vaccinated travel lane and stabilising on local measures a system is already good enough and strenuous on the team on the people opening of causeway border is going to create a big bang to united states again all vaccinated travel lane all social measures for locals will be affected again singapore might still remain the vaccinated travel lane but other countries might not want singapore we need a stable opening up not a huge risk opening up risking what he been achieved pensive face pensive face pensive face
when there think either side of the nation want to take the risk just for short time access
the lancet in the united states and germany high level officials have used the term pandemic of the vaccinated suggesting that people who have been vaccinated are not relevant in the epidemiology of covid of officials use of this phrase might have encouraged one scientist to claim that the vaccinated threaten the vaccinated for covid of a but this view is far too simple
a you of
our art kit is like our vehicles prices it is a few times of the factory price what is the because of this why are we paying so much more who is making money on the horrendous mark up
the factories that manufacture the art kits do not get their materials free the store that stock and sell the art kits are not charitable organizations
freaking pea brain just for an example those similar art kit is selling one quarter of the price in malaysia as compare those selling in singapore

here we go round the mulberry bush brought to you by million money bag money bag money bag circus ten circus tent
my opinion is that it should be open for tourist and those returning home not day tripper that will make it difficult to control perhaps two to days minimum visit hope will not return to are covid nightmare going through the custom
malaysia cases still high stupid idea to open the land transport for malaysia and even our cases are still not stable yet done too noisy and bad air pollution
with this people giving directions to the mon the outcome would be treacherous
mon already under a china loyalist they are going full on to make sure they make money from their investment in biotech a pfizer
tee their investment is our cps money
he is running out of story
did they decide it or just reading a script
daily pass on are all taxed people hardly one untaxed person pass on per week
stop stop stop vaccinated travel lane with malaysia their government and it peoples always threatened singapore to turn off the tap no water supply to singapore
should not we get our numbers to low of is before opening up
how to get below one hundred do another circuit breaker
us is of and a wave is incoming low
maybe we should learn from sydney they did it
a what do you think they did right
they locked down for four months straight until the numbers went down
a so do you suggest we lock down four months or four years
lock down until the numbers are low as per malaysia initial comment
a after lock down the number will go up again once lifted
of vaccination rate but two hundred and two require oxygen supplementation one hundred and ten in ice as well as sixteen deaths utter bollocks
latest news some juicy news to light up the chat
people commenting negative they think they are in comfortable position and worrying not to become worse let us thanks govt first for keeping united states comfortable and let us understand govt is now trying to recover economic condition for better tomorrow
may you live forever
again same rubbish conference instead of preventing the covid spread a deaths the govt continue with their reckless decisions to open borders to more countries in the past a days we have lost five hundred and four lives which is of of the total covid mortality since our st covid death in mar of of in the past sixteen days the covid mortality has increased by of as compared to last month this clearly proves that singapore is in critical covid crises a yet the govt brags about their covid measures to them its collateral damage to lose lives for the sake opening our borders what a incompetent govt
because it is not them who died when it hits them they will sing a different tune

they have no clue
fourteen days data collated and analysed from mon website
who chief calls covid vaccine discrimination as about who is vaccinated it makes no sense to give boosters to healthy adults or to vaccinate children this is a scandal that must stop now he said

singapore is heading for big trouble the western world and united states democracy and human rights are shit nonsense useless and declining
maybe you might want to comment on this report quoted from
I am surprised your comment can be safe malaysia comment was been deleted low

restricting vaccinated pal is to protect them why not restrict those who did not take the flu vaccine i thought gov want united states to treat covid like flu virus

they once said that vaccination campaigns can prevent large scale infections and deaths you became guinea pigs before and your children will follow your destiny
when fucking for anim ohs does not work out and you come back to your sex

children vaccinated even worst even higher risk

sample sizes not large enough only in the context of so i remember reading an overseas study where their results were different and their sample sizes were larger than ours i think that study was done in the us and it showed that up a resulted in a marginally higher level of protection is up a but the same level of increased protection was not seen in my a overall the results of that study seemed to suggest that those who took up for their first two doses would do better with a pfizer booster shot is a modern booster shot while those who took my for their first two doses would see no significant difference in protection regardless which booster vaccine they received i do not remember already
i think you re right talking of pop that's why they re using a as booster for up vaccinated i am not sure with modern though i mean what options are available for them

am sure old generation which part of the majority will have more time reflecting at home now they make up of vaccinated
daily cases around three thousand is still worrisome wonder why milf consider that as stabilized perhaps milf mon should review criteria to define stabilize covid situation in so to say well below one thousand daily cases or much lower and rate of infection well below a of or even lower
ice cases of a leas testing means less cases numbers can be easily manipulated
so long as severe cases in healthcare system is kept low the economy will be opened further regardless of higher transmission rates be it of of a cases per day overall situates is kept intact further relaxation is possible
we said thumbs up thumbs up

oak what proof have you got to say europe is currently undergoing an vaccinated pandemic how many europeans countries have you been to the last three months that made you said what you said
must go there then can talk what kind of logic is that
i also know that the vaccinated can get infected and pass it to the others vaccinated or vaccinated you think oak do not know this without visiting any europe countries always easier to blame the vaccinated for infection spike in any part of the world without data because most will agree without a second thought
after next chance

three thousand cases around is stabilized
so we will expect ask month and of of by quarter right call stable

squid game next better talents please
for example why has the subject of long covid and the govt responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients been avoided
so just who is not telling the truth in its entirety
open ply pakistan ply ply
as i have said no scientific merits and no positive results to do away without quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
so let total infected children are of of a numbers
as i have said long time ago and its outright risky endemic theory will be yet another very costly failure
you know what is political science
judging from the adverse results these days trust will not be granted easily how do you want to blame anyone from thinking likewise
i hope philippines also will have the vaccinated travel lane soon disappointed face
vaccine mandate for children or possibly primary school cluster face with raised eyebrow after school holiday come come place your bets pandemic of the vaccinated right
why your comment deleted
finally good news for those trapped in singapore party popper party popper party popper
you should say earning good money in so many or riding little motorcycles in so back home they can own premium cars for cheap or own bungalows or landed for cheap if not lucrative why would anyone endure the chore of crossing causeways regularly to work nothing to do
by that you mean everyone except for special politicians
the travellers better move fast before another worldwide border closure is imposed in the name of omicron
omicron is now available for early birds across both borders while sticks last
why the hurry to allow general travel are we so desperate to go to johore bar during the school holidays if cases spike again our any holidays will be gone hold the horses please
notice that st youtube setting is to i wonder why i feel so good news i look forward to the new spa media
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy this is not going well for the pm face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
shut up law want to play politics five years later then play
him he is right no doubt about that
him your parents should fall into the counts for you to wake up your ideas to help build and push for a safer environment for everyone especially the poor singaporeans elderly who are dying everyday and not malign others by convolution life safeties with politics
limits never too early to prepare
wong you want to play politics please five years and play all you want
politics of a but not doing so is merely an excuse to avoid future blame single party is unwise and dangerous
so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans for you with you if you will have to accept daily can deaths and thousands community infection for it is not a solution the question is when will it reach you or our family members
question what is the meaning of toto defense when elderly have to fall just to benefit a certain group
why is it detected in johore and not singapore a a pm of causeway can change infection
good question we fail again zany face
buy see soto for pm
promotion of booster shots
vol is exciting but the more important thing is to set a target time for clearance per passenger otherwise the queue will be very long with the excuse more checks is needed due to covid the gov to gov should be able to share by now who has been vaccinated so there is absolutely no need to check these at custom again and waste everybody is time if security is a concern treat all travellers as default vaccinated and only share bet gov for those who are not yet vaccinated for the swab tests results custom officers should check early before the passport booth
sure i you inking face inking face inking face inking face inking face inking face inking face
who strongly recommends against movement restrictions covid measures within in and out of the country who also states that if such restrictions were implemented it should only last for a few days at max
when something is free you are the product
who should send a teams to investigate united states fort derrick lab unit seven hundred and thirty one
the western world and united states democracy and human rights are shit nonsense useless and declining
still talking singapore is heading for big trouble no no no vaccinated travel lane with malaysia their government and its citizens always say that turn of the tap no water supply to singapore wait for another six months
why not with thailand sporrans love to shop in thailand
not fare only malaysian worker only livelihood matters for chinese new year hard closed infection high
the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with co laurie acid and total community viral load can be lowered do not play dice with covid try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time
plus also allow those without work pass or long term pass to visit immediate family member we also need to reunite with family
its necessary to open up to malaysia as we are interlinked in many things
a cautious responsible capable and forward planning spore govt encore
well posted we have good ministers
own self praise own self yawn
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face to face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october
so let total infected children from twenty three oct two thousand and twenty one to nineteen nov two thousand and twenty one alone is a of a numbers
these days trust will not be granted easily for the basis were eroded read continuation
prof to on the nineteen nov two thousand and twenty one said but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources because at this stage the daily number of infection is under counting the number of actual infection happening given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore many people who are infected will not be tested with per test to confirm and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require ice care
bloom bergs covid resilience ranking singapore had drop twenty places to rank at thirty nine even worse than africa maybe only can fool some of you say

jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
seven posts straight from a rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
europe experiencing eth wave and this clown face talking about opening up rolling on the floor laughing
month of december would be interesting to watch
for family category you have to open up to immediate family members who do not hold any work pass or long term visit pass
can we even trust malaysia to open up to singapore through vol
this man cognitive ability is in question anyone in office above the age of sixty must go for testing to make sure they are sound mind a body
good to see malaysian malays and indians coming back here smirking face
all hong in to do security jobs guaranteed a of in few years time ask ringgit can buy nice car and stay in semi detached woo hoo
are you jealous why do not you try to do no ability
basing on the data i think either the min is too complacent at the expense of citizens life safeties or they are only focusing on business and enrichment for a handful of people
i will give those in the pm this they will continue to gamble with our lives
focusing on christmas peak
repeating the same falsehoods
are the death rate falsehoods
tan can you prove that they are falsehoods
let me ensure ensure nothing basing on the daily infection rate and the number of daily demise as we speak these days its getting harder to trust anything from them
if this is awaiting truth sucker wait your time to up lorry as you would have put it callously your time will come
vols and open gates to influxes but metered freedom new coined up terms more protocols and fines for citizens that mere illusion and crop tears would you say
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
lawrence wong said of jul two thousand and twenty one in parliament as we do so we must expect cases to rise partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level also as we open our border for people to travel without she we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily cases numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus they are much less likely to become very ill note capitalized words why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
as i have said yesterday i think they will relax curbs for business context while implementing more protocols and fines for singaporeans
please refrain from falsehoods and slanders
so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans for you with you if you will have to accept daily can deaths and thousands community infection for it is not a solution the question is when will it reach you or our family members
squid game next better talents please
for example why has the subject of long covid and the govt responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients been avoided
why no professors or the govt are addressing on this long covid issues why reporters are not am not posing the relevant questions to them it has become clear that for a considerable proportion of individuals affected by covid of significant clinical manifestations may persist after the first weeks of the acute symptomatic phase with a heterogeneous complex of subacute and chronic symptoms that preclude a full return to the previous state of health this persistence of symptoms which may affect patients of any age and with varying degrees of severity of the acute disease has been recognized as a specific clinical entity called long covid

this restrictive mobility on human volume only encourages human traffickers to resurface again just the same as contraband cigarette
black market inevitable govt is not clever by only providing so little entries even if ten thousand on both sides it is insufficient a modest thirty thousand will be more reasonable however people are at the mercy of this cruel and heartless government will just have to be contented with whatever is been dished out if the government is hoping for appreciation and gratefulness they are dreaming only hatred and disgruntled people on both sides of the causeway are waving their fancy fingers to celebrate this ugly gesture to their respective government in treating their beloved citizens people are not human but digit to the both government
may peace be with you
bye bye go home do not come back
duh of because is sold out looking from youtube comments on singapore is covid restrictions and unrecognised brands of covid vaccine feud in singapore you'll know they aren't citizens all its

whether in out please spare a tot for government on both side without quarantine either way got suppl go thru are positive might cos a issue
anyone heard of serious injuries or death after booster shot
yes heard of uncles aunties fathers even young is death very obvious and no one is making noise many questioning are silenced if not censored we have a very dangerous narrative right now
insider its indeed shocking the media censorship on such a serious matter of public healthcare which has become utterly one sided parma sponsored narratives
please proceed with extra caution under the vaccinated travel lanes
as i have said no scientific merits and no positive results to do away without quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
so let total infected children are of of a numbers
squid game next better talents please
so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans for you with you if you will have to accept daily can deaths and thousands community infection for it is not a solution the question is when will it reach you or our family members

i like to watch a broadcast with no news casters
a not that the truth
stay safe while travelling as new variant is there
sounds very troublesome and expansive just to cross the border let
the whole world is now turn into a theatre for staging drama according to the script issued by the soup alphabet organizations of the elites
singapore inevitably will get omicron like hong kong because of huge international hub hopefully these people will not spread it to johore very soon
hope johore don't spread to singapore
school of science it works both ways with these two places so close and inter dependent to one another
mao true that but tell to or enforcer grinning face with sweat face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
alexandria school of science johore is hermit state where nobody go to their airport while singapore is the international hub got your fact straight even super strict hong kong also already got
alexandria school of science and as of now there at least one of covid be case coming from singapore
org is that the new variant

put your trust not in this world nor the things in it it waste your chance to be free from sin and receive eternal life
two corinthians a a but the things which are not seen are eternal
what has what is your point
whoever design omicron virus need to burn in hell
the vaccinated are ones to let the virus evolved
task you mean the vaccinated ones
blame the rich countries for not sharing the vaccines
how much is per in singapore and in johore bar definitely no day trip anymore
i think too troublesome and expansive just to japan japan in johore bar for a day
hopefully the system goes well
bermuda it will not be possible to eradicate the virus it will remain for thousands of years but acting in the right way that there may be another occurrence of infections is the fault of the leaders of each state who allow without any precaution the non use of quality masks and the moving from one person to another this as well as the stupid of and of rules were thought without really thinking that they are therefore useless because many of the supposed vaccines are completely useless that which number in the millions and pretend that so many people have actually been vaccinated are completely useless and mislead even the heads of state and responsible epidemiologists virologists and physicians about something that is not really there
quickly go back guys before new variant lock down
if its not this of malaysia crown it will be something else other mutants waiting in the all costs reunite with family while you can
well done to our singapore government for this vol hundred pointsSingaporethumbs upright skin tone thumbs up medium skin tone thumbs up medium light skin tone thumbs up ion

lovely info soon we are going to explore singapore with our group of our tour clients miss singapore sunrise
with new variant detected what are we going to do since the vaccine is unable to work the new variant to protect our citizens
in future all compulsory singapore must take ord four booster a this going to happen in our country whats the effects in future after this all booster all this experiments for united states take booster
business lost can restart but lives lost is forever gone
business lost can restart but lives lost is forever gone
in erection is the solution
covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body of
do you hear the people sing
covid vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite covid of is cumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak of of
everyday we have more than two thousand three thousand infected cases and our government says that we are stabilizing and improving stop deceiving ourselves many countries are afraid of travellers from singapore
sentence these three stooges to death by hong charges treason and endangering public health
after applying all the brakes we will still end up downhill
anyone able to assist malaysia mon is a long visit pass holder we were very happy finally we can dine in as one family after of of thus we booked a restaurant on of of when we arrived the waitress asked united states to prove that we all are staying at the same household than i realised i cant prove that sheds actually staying together with me because her lip i had i would doesn't have Malaysia address so we tried trace together token again there wasn't able to prove as well it was so sad in the end we were being rejected weary face weary face we tried to called mon hotline to make query but it was answering machine disappointed face disappointed face
jesus christ is coming back to the earth to resolve everything
watch as five phonies try their best not to blink while reading off their scripts cannot lie
covid a has the structure of his whereby vaccine try to deceive your immunity system to create to cell perish together with the virus just like overclocking immunity system temporarily but unable to deceive the new variant covid vaccine is a obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite
wow it seems that mtg can even manipulate mon to report selective covid death and infection numbers so conveniently to support vol
now then you know gov control basically everything
remember the good old kampong days at japan kay there are lots of kan hong spider malaysia mum always spray lots of insecticide banned them from entering our house missed those days
sacrificing singaporeans lives so as to opening the borders for the economy has now to nought citizens from other countries like demark europe are restricted to coming singapore who would like to visit a country infested with covid nineteen infection and numerous deaths
for vaccinated employees in singapore whose work cannot be performed from home employers can opt to terminate their employment as a last resort from one january next year
singapore residents will no longer be able to enjoy two way quarantine free travel with denmark after the country reclassified singapore as a country with a high risk of covid of infections
we should request reelection this year
bring peoples action party down please
song both of of flip here flip there very fun right hah aha
what control pal still dies
END arrow ON arrowS ON arrow
thumbs up
dude you should voice it out write in comment section no use

wow well paid ministers at least a to work on tasks force zine and a bali like finland and sweden
to deep state when you see i one hundred and forty four thousand you are in end time repent or die
the relationship between viral dose and covid of severity tulane researchers chad roy pad and or gregory big this review found that the virus is primarily transmitted through the inhalation of particles containing virus and that the ability of those particles concentration of viral particles plus the length of time one is in necessarily experience more severe disease than an individual who is infected with a smaller amount
the easing is a freaking joke
so what when infected rate fall below one but death rates shoot up seventeen more deaths today
its obviously a joke the infected rate can be manipulated easily less tests lower number own self affirmed own self peoples action party mantra
you back with civilians lives and now like that maybe you should use the mouth wash given out in your mouth and on your brain
tyranny will not have happy ending that for sure
yes when pal not trusting them anymore
not allow untaxed people enter shopping mall is league
did they say its our choice to vaccine but now all restrictions a focus on vaccinated pal unacceptable punishment to the vaccinated this is too much
none can above law united states citizen already started sue biden
the situation is stabilize it is not reduce cases yet it is not safe yet mon want to increase the cases back and see more people to die everyday again
so slumps to perfect one hundred ranking on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
opening for house visit for five pass
some key covid of facts if you are interested
us research shows that vaccinated peoples peak viral load is same as vaccinated people in home recovery settings and by inference vaccinated people will also pass their virus to others in similar close settings as much as vaccinated people so why put the blame solely on vaccinated people mtg needs to do homework and keep themselves abreast of covid research developments instead of just conveniently using vaccinated people as scapegoat for failed policies already vaccinated people are kept away from many places for more than two weeks infection numbers have not abated at all this proves that vaccinated people are not the ones causing the a of a numbers all this while vaccinated people are being witch hunted
covid vaccine is an obstruction of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily like morphine sulfite covid a is accumulative and permanently stay at human body to cell then because it malfunction to replicate destroy and spread even you have fully recovered from covid infection or fully vaccinated peoples will die in covid one day when the immunity system become weak
nothing but the truth
the audio is too soft i cannot hear anything
you can re talking about four digits so what if our weekly rate drops by of we still have a of cases which is a very high number for a population of a pm

why overseas bloom berg people can have five dining on same table when they are from different household
because the ministers can mind control the virus
open la open la mai to liao kin booster three four five
right but those five fundus on that table are from the same household seems totally legit
they are not eating nor socializing voodoo pinkie use your brain can or not before you speak
still using the term pandemic every variant only can be neutral or weaker with time never more effective in any sense includes rate of transmission
pfizer sponsors all the major news networks in the us how accurate can media covered by the news be when they are sponsored by pfizer
please find in it all mankind is threatened with death under a notorious company
look at indonesia which is the world best in managing and fighting the covid look at the poster boy denmark which singapore promoted heavily as the successful nation in fighting the pandemic presumably based on a inns readership crashed after all its fake and shoddy news and today denmark is trying its best to avoid being the next singapore covid nation
stabilised i am trying to hypnotize myself now
be you the whole world will adjust to revolve around you
we have to be realistic and stay united with the govt to get the good results no policy can please all
so slumps to perfect one hundred ranking on covid recovery index source nikkei asia five nov twenty one
a good gov will not trade the life of their citizen for economic
a good govt will not let its citizens die of hunger
you know i know all know
meanwhile in our daily mon reports we no longer dare to report how many vaccinated patients died the previous day

pc pass tests to check on anti body levels should be considered for returning citizens prs migrant workers vaccinated in certain countries where certification is not so reliable a kids should also have access to non mana vaccines
pfizer sponsors all the major news networks in the us a how accurate can media covered by the news be when they are sponsored by pfizer
did they really go below one on infection growth rate just because the less on certain days the rate just happily goes down and even the cases increase by almost a thousand the infection growth rate when down instead of up between eight nov nine nov guess is either typo error human error or screw up data data for mon website
are self tests and home guarantees considered
a thinks you should questions those who are infected why are they not following the safety measures than talking about the infected rates stop are all nonsense questions and stay safe
bee job yes agree with a
tan what safety measures that these pal are not following
tan hey noon you cannot stop infection want to wear ten masks also if you are infected then you are living in a medical bubble face with rolling eyes
there is so many unknowns with these vaccines i believe all the is recruits got the modern
thank you channel news asia for this report on singapore swift intervention to demolish this pandemic
if you have no idea about no then better to go to another church
ski three hundred and sixty nine not talking to you three hundred and sixty nine
sigh next general election is two thousand and twenty five
heard they changed it to of of
they do not dare to wait till two thousand and twenty five when vaccine it side effects start to show up
a should move to another country where is absolute no control and see how you survive
useless crying face set so many ridiculous rules are you going to tell the world world map that singapore Singapore is still not safe loudly crying face rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat crying face
if the vaccine worked they wouldn't need any restrictions
williams if vaccine did not work many of you whiners would already be floating down the ganges river
ski three hundred and sixty nine no its been two years since people were dropping dead on the street in wuhan since then most deaths have been elderly
dine in should be restricted to a so pal only open mouth to eat
since you want to keep forcing me to get vaccinated with all your policies i will make sure the next election you will not get malaysia vote
so you voted for them the last time low
they are worse than a boyfriend keep asking for sex low
five from same household of to dine in at restaurants same as five foreigners probably not from same household but maybe same country coming for bloom berg forum a married couple can dine in at parents house but they are restricted to dine with their parents at restaurants i wonder why
are you sure every country will send five delegates bloom berg will more likely five participants from different countries sitting together dining and probably more talking amongst themselves than having food in their mouth i think most restaurants will follow what they did last time continue to restrict all diners to two persons a table to be safe from violation regardless whether they are from same household or not this rule hard to enforce and is a fail
so many ads literally one every few mind the speaker hans another and already can how much money do you wanna make from this
a block can download law
what has what is the point even booster can get effected this happen to malaysia friend mon unless there is the cured for covid instead of tax
a cure is definitely somewhere out there whether we a allowed access is another issue
i know this is very off topic but are not am not those people who ask questions from like media companies how come the way they speak english when asking questions sounds so non media company like non news like like very char for imagine going to consult like a mathematician and he seems to be struggling adding up numbers
that's the way most singaporeans speak
no true normal singaporeans but they re in media professionals
i know so embarrassing this happens when our schools do not emphasize on speaking proper english most singaporeans like to mumble and swallow their words when they speak we do not speak clearly
announcement is easy but there is no planning ahead to ensure vaccination centre restaurants etc are ready after announcement its confusion and mess where is the efficiency we were once so proud of
double standard restriction is not helping local businesses and own citizens it caters more to outsiders coming in
five total strangers can dine together at bloom berg new economy forum in nov discrimination at its finest
a minute of silence for the thousands of family members who lost their loved ones while others who are so eagerly to dine in travel and gather socially
damn sian every few months do this like stupid lid at grinning squinting face

why recorded music in feb dangerous virus will dance and mutate is it org high
face with tears of joy hama
for travellers they like entertainment look how european american has started with concert and huge gathering even to mask think they give a damn what will happen to others rolling on the floor laughing

ahmad do you live in a plastic bubble scared of your own shadow jeez always wondered what kind of craven people would allow fascism to save their own skins at any cost now i see clearly what type that is
grinning face
two thousand and seventeen what he said is true tho research was done last year that when one projects ones voice more droplets will be expelled tit with virus
tucker bird so recorded music can spit out droplets is it
jellybean recorded music funny is it
feet because people have to raise their voices to talk to one another be it recorded or live music
tucker bird people going to feb of
feet you mean people only eat and do not talk while having meals low delusional
tucker bird so those diners eating with their mask on is it how silly billy you are
feet what are you talking about you are drifting further and further away from topic with loud music be it recorded or live one needs to talk loudly to be heard whether feb outlets or to geddit
tucker bird so that means music to be banned everywhere here it so you mean people will talk loud only when recorded music being played go visit coffee shop and hawker and gym you will hear some loud stuff over there so now you are the one got drifted away from reality geddit

no agenda these conferences are merely a facade for the masses who are in deep coma
more people vaccinated and more people infected and died what is the point of vaccination if residents are not vaccinated at all like last year but got very small figure in infection and death compare to the current situation which you prefer obviously wrong vaccines are being used and wrong strategies and tactics are being applied is the main causes behind look at hong kong taiwan mainland china macao singapore is the worst affected region with chinese government shame on you pap and now you shameless ministers trying to push responsibility and finding excuses some more government should responsible for the death and the current serious situation
wait till you see them target our most vulnerable children

test yourself no country can have such resources to test so many people daily
the icon deaths will tell you where the overall trend is or mon aka biz icons major are you insane
it is not about the test but the statistics they areas safe to open up
positive cases using art test also not included in the numbers they report so actually not accurate
you can also base it on infection rate there are of a positive out of of of a who gone for per test in the past this was a a clearly the situation is getting worse taken from google stats
chan to make it worse there are of a positive out of of of a people who took the test
nothing new the same is again use to evade responsibility and accountability they are repeating what they have been saying times over times nothing new
why singapore is not reporting the breach of data integrity in pfizer vaccine trial south korea has already expressed concern publicly
they have invested in pfizer stocks you think they will shoot themselves in the foot
one hundred and sixty media
i hide malaysia test paper from malaysia mon when i fail the test so that no one know I am lazy
south korean are seeking justice from the murderers

do you hear the people sing
covid will get them soon
eases restrictions on foreigners but restrict own residents
dear ministers thank you
high risk
she not ease so fast till cases are low why my keep making things difficult for vaccinated pals not fair infection can be spread for vaccinated pals plus give understanding to the vaccinated pals who he no choice at all
if you want fairness then go and get vaccinated infection can spread from anyone tax or no tax no choice your own guess medically certified
so they he turned heartless
how long will it take for the cases to go down lock down is the only way to get the cases to go down but for how long then when they ease the measures goes back again then whats the point its endless already la covid is here to stay just face it

gal what kind of tax cine requires vaccinated people to vaccinate to protect the vaccinated people
tucker bird its like someone bought an umbrella but they need united states to buy one to protect them from the rain low
mon must ensure that places like non air con coffee shops are well ventilated and air circulation as far as air on premises there should be some clear guidelines
you mean all big malls theatres and supermarkets
tuck choose the important thing is that there should be air movement turbulence so that particles are dispersed and diluted when people cough sneeze or talk loudly to dilute the particle concentration
talking for so many months yet everyday still seeing thousands of covid of cases really unbelievable
not months its one year nine months
bravo to the task force for opening up in a cautious manner
so thumbs up
thumbs up thumbs up
means that they can bring their maid for a dine in
in the other news discrimination at its finest
its all about big heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign yes
boy or girl two kids maximum if you want to bring maid
the government should have ensured booster shots were rolled out to more people before they start opening up this would have given more protection to those whose vaccine had waned esp in those people who are elderly or who had comoros cities and helped to reduce the severely i shall i wIll and deaths on balance i think the government was hasty resulting in unnecessary sufferings and deaths
if main tax does not you see your own blindness here
do you really think these boosters work
please also realize that many die suffer permanent injuries from boosters due to daily too these are not reported
check out did by geest van den boss he insidious face of pandemic variants and you will see why boosters and vaccines are harmful
let us face it whether you like it or not the peasants cannot do a thing about it so it is up to the peasants to protect themselves some peasants are still not wearing their masks properly and even chatting on the trains and buses these peasants deserved to up lorry
if they say the moon is square they make sure we say yes
that how sheep your beloved island is
you are the only one to think that way you know why you are a makers
five total strangers can dine together at bloom berg new economy forum in nov discrimination at its finest
and you are yakking to the makers so it makes you a maker too
talk this talk that by end of the day still want to earn our money by finding fault a fine us
follow the rules no need to be fined
need to open to bangkok and bali also than more tourist will come to help boost tourism
why not
talk like cases ten or less open up so more a more cases target hit of la
stabilise better position everyone of united states knows at least person or one whole family who are covid walk the ground then you know when the healthcare system got tired blame the pal not the policy sigh and keep saying we are getting better you should pat your own self on the back
i do not know anyone in singapore who had it before
i don't know anyone got covid
rip seniors you voted them in kept them in power and now they leave you behind
many seniors gathering downstairs playing checkers without masks they don't care they want to live life
truth well said these false concerns are almost laughable these are the ones who are scared
more people vaccinated and more people infected and died what is the point of vaccination if residents are not vaccinated at all like last year but got very small figure in infection and death compare to the current situation which you prefer obviously wrong vaccines are being used and wrong strategies and tactics are being applied is the main causes behind look at hong kong taiwan mainland china macao singapore is the worst affected region with chinese government shame on you pap and now you shameless ministers trying to push responsibility and finding excuses some more government should responsible for the death and the current serious situation
truth of of a seniors in singapore unix you are not alone folded hands
kerr wanna say they deserve it but hindsight is of of
minister you mean foreign worker are stay in same is whole also allowed right if the stay together and same address
those seniors who still live till next be be smart like new generation to vote more capable representatives grinning squinting face
boon was see what happen on eve of deep valid when mtg give leeway to them they crowd at the side of the road like nobody business and how do we know if many did not wear mask smart decision by mtg rolling on the floor laughing
meanwhile albania says life is normal there with hardly any change from two thousand and eighteen
chat to achieve their target they can keep blaming others so that they are always right blaming the vaccinated for spreading the virus and ignore the fact that vaccinated spread the same amount of virus too ignore the fact that number is much higher now before we are vaccinated
because they need to lick the no feet before and after this talk clown face
because the virus is dangerous only to the peasants and not politicians or celebrities on to shows
one rule for me one rule for thee
rules for thee and not for me another way of putting it across anxious face with sweat face with medical mask

dirty lousy liars and hypocrites lousy hypocrites lee sign long peoples action party government
mtg well done a keep going star struck partying face two hundred and ninety six need oxygen one hundred and thirty four in ice four hundred and thirty cases not alarming the rest are asymptomatic a mild cases will not die have recovered or recovering victory hand only spore is reporting daily other countries do not bother to report after vaccination face with tears of joy the for the update a appreciate clapping hands
well said our govt is transparent
hama of transparent
world fifty upon fifty is full marks
vaccine is not of a they know but they refuse to accept the reality
between a rock and a hard place we are
we are stuck in the mud beaming face with smiling eyes
wrong of voted to be screwed
feet in cement you mean winking face with tongue
feet quicksand more like i loudly crying face
put a said that measuring immunity level is not relevant or he meant not important which fake medical university he graduated from
strange the opposition are very quiet all at sea taking notes all peoples action party maps the safest ward is tanning pagan try to persuade or chan to swap places but or chan cannot be that willing to prove himself
in line with promises when ratio becomes a
since when did stupid comments ever make a difference shudder a follow of
after giving of as pittance money to our healthcare workers which can only be credited in december they have now decided to tip them further off the cliff no wonder we are ranked one hundred in the covid nineteen recovery index with indonesia and malaysia ahead of us the leadership lacks empathy direction and is clearly discriminatory against the unix where is the transparency in reporting numbers hiding something
hope on be kun and kenneth a will be thrown to jail soon these son of beaches now wants to push kids for the vaccine when there is not even one single death cases among kids a of years old in singapore how to even justify the risk benefits ratio
why are they all not wearing masks when not speaking
they are robots immune to covid
because they are all hypocrites with double standards
they are elites elites do not wear masks when speaking only peasants have to wear masks
mask is just precautionary measure look at and mon countries full house stadiums singing cheering standing side by side each other massless
they need to lick the no feet before and after the talk that why do not need wear laura
truth i know but can you see the double standards there you are asking people to wear masks and failure to do so will lead to of a fine but here you are not practising what you preach how to take them seriously
him bios of voted for them error
its hard to breath and they know it
as we all know how effective masks are especially when viewing formate transmission compared to air vector but hey keep doing as your told and watch as your owners do what they want
him whatever you vote will not decide who is in power their puppet master no the one to decide not only in singapore but everywhere in the world wanna be free from them then risk like war in mid east woozy face
hmm next election will have mail in or vote online options for election integrity
just like how joe biden and the left wing liberal democrat liars stole the election

gaius hold on longer these vaccines got it side effects major illnesses like alzheimer parkinson etc
tucker bird i would like too if choice was given but its a top down regulation the cost of pet is worth a days wage and the option to be fired from company by or is already in play if compliance is not met
gaius have you tried looking for alternative employment in the meantime your health and life is worth much more once you take the poison it is a point of no return
tucker bird you do realize that this will be enforced island wide right its only a matter of time
gaius there may be some compassionate employers mtg said fire as last resort some will use this as excuse to get rid of certain employees but perhaps there may be some who will show compassion and hire vaccinated people and may those employers be blessed
tucker bird not worth it limo catching the virus and landing in the hospital will incur financial troubles and its getting difficult to move around it is what it is
gaius vaccines got it side effects that are even more costly to fix alzheimer is one of side effects and recently a drug was approved for emergency use for alzheimer that cost ask for twenty years no drug approved for alzheimer but they know tax cine will because alzheimer a of major illnesses be caused by vaccines so they quickly approve drug in time for vaccinated people who will get alzheimer soon

singapore september twenty three there are ten suspected cases of cerebral venous thrombosis cut or blood clot in the brain among those who have received the pfizer and modern vaccines for covid of in singapore can the ministers tell united states what has what is happening to them have they fully recovered
many more vaccine injuries which are swiftly covered up by the media common sense should tell united states that if it carries a risk it must be a choice clearly the highly paid people are unable to comprehend this
a must be honest to our citizen
they are just stats to the elites

since the vaccine discrimination started on with oct two thousand and twenty one until today eth nov two thousand and twenty one we have of of a cases and three hundred and fourteen deaths
the death rates are reaching five hundred mark i do not know where you get that stats
sale from mon website tabulate daily to spread sheet since the vaccine apartheid starts
one thousand and twenty four currently there are of of cases from what i read how come yours is only ask thinking face
sale of of must be the total cases to date i am saying from with oct till now
one thousand and twenty four i see thanks for clarifying grinning face with sweat
sale just to make a point the untaxed in eateries are not the sole contributors to covid this discrimination is uncalled for will stop inputting data until the vaccine apartheid is lifted
one thousand and twenty four they do not disclose those death are vaccinated or unix must be too embarrassing to
a of a new case clearly shows the rubbish mana jabs a discrimination not working
one thousand and twenty four discrimination at its finest

one thousand and twenty four scapegoats needed a needn't apply anxious face with sweat face with head bandage disappointed face
five thousand eight hundred and sixty four malaysia dad was one of those who passed on he has he is vaccinated but when he was in ice everyone else was vaccinated elderly a complications before malaysia dad died some of them had passed on already too covid pneumonia can happen to vaccinated elder lies too a it can be fatal

ski three hundred and sixty nine stupid or not remains to be seen comment again ten years later after it is proven that no long term side effects plus looking at stats here and elsewhere with high vaccination rate vaccines are proven not to protect against severe illness and deaths too vaccines do not stop infection and spread too so who are the really stooped ones
tucker bird average ppr expected to die younger mark malaysia words in of yrs
a it is very sad culling of population worldwide worried for the children they have a long winding road ahead full of hardships after taking vaccines reputable docs in united states said that children will be clients of pharmaceutical companies for life be because tax cine will because all kinds of major illnesses in it and these cost much much more to heal than covid itself
tucker bird i dunno about the first two jabs but continuing every year is nonsense
a indeed nov of united states ada I shall I will surely approve vaccines for all adults more I shall I will drop dead or become severely I shall I will not from covid but from poison of vaccines
a if you check vars of us many reported adverse side effects in the hundreds thousands from st two jabs but they were not reported by media same will go for booster shots biggest cover up in history
chan please go back to kindergarten and learn english again your entire paragraph does not make sense
ski three hundred and sixty nine not everyone can take mana not taking
tucker bird checked fact from insurance companies longevity reserves as they re reducing that in anticipation of lower life expectancy
vaccine must not be force it should be own decision
such a cold hearted measure for seniors who are not vaccinated if they fell ill regardless of covid infection they might hesitate to see doctor for the concern of medical cost here you are suggesting them to suffer and die alone at home in the worst case you regard them as suicidal and neglect them
that correct cold heartless especially there is zero compelling evidence to show unix is the problem
a is very cruel to treat our a vaccinate senior
pray to god he will punish them
the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members gandhi
i do not trust anyone that treats other people this way
i see so many seniors gathering a of playing some checkers games downstairs smoking massless and don't give a crap seniors don't care and don't need you to speak up for them
truth what they do is none of your business do not pretend to care i believe you are vaccinated why are you so afraid do you think its safer in crowded air on bus and art
of vaccination rate but exponential rise in cases clusters a deaths insanity
five thousand eight hundred and sixty four low you think i care and am afraid i am saying seniors also don't care so don't use them as excuse to criticise govt
these old folks survived world wars only to be treated like a leper from this administration
mad of voted to be screwed

one people one nation one singapore else you are discriminated
hardened and darkened hearts there a place already reserved for them

omicron is an anagram of moronic squinting face with tongue
singapore govt is strange when its time to make quick decision immediate action they are silence this omicron virus is highly contagious it has shown to replace variant a quickly in some countries it has mutated thirty two times making existing vaccines ineffective fully vaccinated were the carriers a spreaders immediate action needed to curb entry a quarantine they sit on it hoping for miracle if omicron ever enter singapore it will spread very quickly and is not the bunch of highly overpaid incompetent can manage
if the government can prevent omicron variant from spreading to singapore then they have at least redeemed themselves
hama opening more travel bubble will perpetuate more spikes as the new virus no is more contagious than delta now is the best time to work on alternatives instead on hyping on the benefits of vaccinations
testing two
while many countries are shutting off incoming visitors a for the sake of money is opening up be patient we will pay the high price no way of prevention
low endemic already
respect covid people not scare covid beaming face with smiling eyes
as a lot of countries is pulling back travelling our ministers is still promoting it putting the our country into the highest risk we know now that the new omicron is very highly affection able and is immune to the vaccine available can we start to recall our vol
and because of our governments greed new variants enter singapore they are really only thinking about their own well being its time for a change no more corrupt officials and that particular family that controlled singapore for centuries
can we invite someone with a medical background to speak on the new variant the focus was completely off for me with this new variant what seems to be the concern here is the impact on travel that is not having a big enough worldview what about the impact on our society healthcare and our people as a whole i came here to find out more about the new variant didn't expect to hear some stats on travel
exhibit how disgraceful and demeaning to a species known as the king of beasts
the only sure thing is if people themselves are responsible thoughtful and proactive
the rich is not rich enough need a new variant to transfer more wealth from the lower and middle class taking from their small pensions and forever print money and low interest that the rich can afford feel sorry for rich people does not own everything the shameless global politician following the rich instructions
that all about two things one is gaining all the wealth and power over the world two is fearing that they may lost it so they need to constantly create more fear and strive among ordinary people for them to succeed
is maw is friend went to a of hour clinic after getting a lump on her underarm area which allegedly appeared after receiving her covid of booster shot conclusion never go and see a doctor for post vaccination injuries
and they think just bus they speak better english make the great a trustworthy the main concern here is the patients concern it english moron
congratulation singapore for letting malaysian worker home then close the because so they canon came back to work no more dollars only ringgit canon proud already face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
but many africans in thailand cos many flights between thailand and africa sure to open
his strategy what strategy he is simply increasing the risk factors
so should not start the travel so fast once the deadly come to singapore it will be worst affect the only worry is the front line people traveller or citizen coming to singapore should she at the designated hotel for of of days for singapore citizens they should not she at home if you want to travel then you must think of those living in so
cannot escapee from the unseen enemy
please include philippines also we are so super stretch drained and stress away from our family i hope you compassionately consider it
omicron is mutated thirty two times that making existing vaccines ineffective and useless it is highly contagious several times worst than a variant if it hit singapore the spread will be quick a unstoppable it is irresponsible to ignore new variants and continue to open up freely
they are welcoming omicron into singapore when they screw up they will push the blame and punish singaporeans they never apologize resign or take responsibility a accountability that dictatorship system
more vaccines are being developed and produced just to convince people worldwide that these vaccines are effective and are needed to protect people against corona virus yet another sly tactic to market the vaccines to make money
exactly so they need to constantly create more variants after variants which is nothing but only fear and strive among ordinary people for them to succeed
just open law to foreign country so bored no foreigners here
no need to worry
a bunch of incompetents
incompetent yeah
up to of a more infectious than delta
i like david lee the sports correspondent he is knowledgeable and speaks well
or kos you need to enunciate
the dreadful breakthrough infection can effectively be prevented with co laurie acid and total community viral load can be lowered do not play dice with covid try to protect the community and your loved ones at the same time one
scientists are still baffled how dinosaurs became extinct until they found the first fossil that suggested they sneezed sneezing face like humans
singapore welcome omicron we would like to sincerely welcome you to our country here you are exempted from any taxes and are free to roam if you get what i mean hope you enjoy your stay
singaporeans just cant wait to welcome to the new variant
just liked variant the only means for new variant to enter singapore is from external only those who has the power to do so can welcome new variant not singaporeans
when they screwed up failed to block a variant entry they blame and punish apple no apologise truly incompetent
chan really they supported the system that economy over lives and thus responsible for the virus
chan if you must know the present lot of government will never learn just wait till january well be back to square one again too many people in this country are too selfish self centred and ignorant to know any better
they will come without invitation no need to welcome
chan incompetent yeah grinning face with sweat rolling on the floor laughing
new covid variant have likely reach so will know in two or three weeks time
a flight from a to holland yesterday was found to have thirty nine pax who were infected this virus is reported to be of a more infectious than delta
markov of a more infectious no problem just need five hundred booster shots for error ruler of the planet omicron perseid
they blamed the karaoke operators for being irresponsible are they not the bigger karaoke operators inviting foreigners without quarantine
no need to quarantine law be open and let us have some country immunity
when an idiot has nothing to offer he rides the coattails of someone else just to get that little limelight ignoring him again
everybody travels for a different reason out of necessity please come party in singapore and do not forget to bring your own version of covid nineteen as you would your twelve year old johnny walker
look do you really understand what he is saying
look never mind no need to waste time
boosters here i come
omicron is coming of malaysia god
only covid ends the world will be normal is vaccinated travel lane all useless travelling means happiness is vaccinated travel lane travelling must travel with covid in the mind
its of the milf will safely import in the latest newfangled strain from all over the world as a leading aviation hub thumbs up
yes we will live with them its perfectly normal
good to vent some frustration here to have some control in this scale of challenge
am i reading right
yes you read right living with the virus endemic living
its like guerilla warfare you neutralize the insurgent the family and friends of that fighters become guerilla fighters will not the virus that break through a mana vaccinated person and replicate a spike protein that is immune to the vaccine for survival
so hoping that singapore should also ban he belgium israel and countries that open to south africa a on top of banning a

yes that would be you slightly smiling face safe and sound
the fear tactics have to end now if not open and close borders will never end

are you groping on women
stop reporting on covid surges not really at a really
fair la the virus whack hard ray deep valid and now christmas sure chinese new year also affected
how about labour day
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
omicron will test the singapore government on whether they learnt anything from delta bale to two person dining together
read carefully what those mem like reuters nov twenty six say and this become the basis for all those parma sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens
this no variant is reported to be a very deadly one far dangerous than delta
jab jab low this is your new normal you asked for it
i don't think anyone asked for this seriously
the lost man parable source the earth store bodhisattva sutra chapter eight discussion with yam aloha
if the no variant is not serious the world stock exchange would not reacted to it with the bearish mood moving into a big slip
to be fair the stock been going to high its expected to come down anyway just that the corona make the down worse thinking face everyone been taking bout the stock coming down soon for a while even before the corona mutation news
the pig story a story of three little pigs the media authority and self proclaimed
this guy is going to get united states into very serious problem the no variant is going review how naive he is
do not let the dogs out
omicron variant sounds french

that the reason always the word never learnt at all
learn what this virus just born let

wag what must come will come
keep blinking the eyes mate
tired eyes drift across the shore the darkness and you
in a rush to open borders to so many countries almost all at once risk of losing control of the situation will definitely increase singapore is such a small country where is it going to get the resources needed to properly manage the situation
we are a rich country
yes the big big risk is losing control
every country will get this virus eventually
we do not want this happen in singapore but they want what can you do nothing we can do right
the big problem is that we are small and overcrowded secondly too many people coming in and leaving
delta and now omicron does not care whether you are rich or not
exactly how i look each time i get malaysia nose poked
sure there are some a hole will misuse the vaccinated travel lane bypass and spread the virus
what happen to the dislike is tube control by the of king peoples action party spore govt
please believe whatever st says they have absolutely no conflict of interest they are trustworthy arbiters of truth take malaysia word for it
i take umbrage face with tears of joy

new jabs for everyone for every new mutants
read carefully what those mem like reuters nov twenty six say and this become the basis for all those parma sponsored authoritarian regime is to enforce booster dose on its citizens
govt did not procure yet perhaps one more booster might help
all vaccine makers are currently testing the effectiveness of existing vaccines against new mutant it might take around two weeks there is possibility they might tweak the chemical content of current vaccine to account for this new variant
just in time for christmas based on gap and equality

wuhan virus started of this pandemic you still haven't catch the ball person facepalmingmedium light skin tone male sign
new strain in africa and african lion i urge not to use the term african to avoid some from is perceiving racist remarks we should can the new strain mutant a that older strain found in india we also call it south asian right so we must continue to welcome and support ceca
its only a matter of time before the new variant gets in through a vol
all the variants travel by airlines
absolutely true and no because for alarm every country including china will get it live as usual and get vaccinated
thumbs up
i hope for once the singapore authorities and medical experts are ahead of the curve to proactively manage the advent of the variant because the vaccine may not work as well for one vaccinated travel lane from the united kingdom should be modified with some form of supervised quarantine as this is a country most exposed to travellers from the african continent
omicron will arr sooner than expected source yahoo twenty seven nov
you see he is in pain which dumb doctor came up with this torture method to test covid
cannot close border forever if planes go bankrupt people can never travel ever again
okay let anybody who wants to travel travel anyone who scared covid just self quarantine at home problem solved
exactly already a better solution than the milf
the guy who wants to travel is the problem dude the new variant will come into singapore from change airport
dude there will always be new variants the virus only becomes weaker with each variant never stronger by any standard
meanwhile the untaxed cannot even earn a living
the virus become weaker because more people die and the virus has less opportunity to infect others great
actually if you look at or steven quays lab report during the hearing at covid top conference he mentions that with each mutation the virus becomes weaker never more effective that includes the rate of transmission the chance that it becomes more effective is less than a even through very clever used of of a optimised forced combinations of the covid hot spot gene code sequence is almost impossible
its true the other way too it just need to combine mutate with another to make it more transmissible more deadlier shrugs
brush that untrue
a men did you watch the hearing even if its done cleverly under perfect lab conditions with multiple successes and not a single failure throughout several years its still a a chance aka almost impossible for it to be more transmissible or deadlier
well tell that to the doctor who presented his work and lab studies at the covid top conference the guy has been working on covid since cars is unbiased has one of the best credentials with regards to this virus
its not in yet it will spread like wildfire since its new please dun use one key for all locks its not going to work malaysia six year old knows that
we will use many keys and many locks get vaccinated is one key or lock ask your six year old
for yours we use one lock and one key however we throw yours into the sea end of story
is just a matter of time crying face
it will come here eventually be prepared
yeah right so by introducing vaccinated travel lane in singapore Singapore change airport delta variant clusters wont mutate right face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing seriously naive and gullible think koreans in macula kit singapore island desert island rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
lion also ken swab test a cd
most likely they sedate the lion and in his sleep he is in pain like the man in
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
cheers you are a positive person great role model
lions having covid is soon wrong
yea considering from who they got it from
vaccinated all the animals so there protected from the asymptomatic humans with break thru infections after taxed
govt should start preparing for hospital capacity to be ready for this being more severe a immunity to vaccines would mean stay home recovery would not be possible
delta is scared of our whining
clicked because alex karl is in the thumbnail
so now the spike protein has been improved and made of a more lethal knowing that the virus was never isolated and thus lab manufactured welcome to covid a a upgraded version
we cannot lock down forever we all will own nothing and be happy he
they expose united states to the virus then they punish the in tax nice
safety is just a word only
so is fear
why only from sunday should be closed to travellers from those seven regions immediately it was first detected in mid nov and one infected traveller each has already gone to hong kong and israel as of today who knows how many they have already infected by now if the target is to prevent entry of the variant into our country while more research is done then border closure to these seven regions should be done immediately the worst factor is that the four cases found in botswana were all foreigners on a diplomatic mission and have all already left the country diplomats they could have gone anywhere since and might even have been accorded special quick access based on their status as diplomats
and so we roll the dice again hoping against hope that we do not find disaster at our door once more i am keeping malaysia fingers crossed
nothing is free when something is free you are the product
yeah that's true indeed absolutely right thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
the product is either good or bad depend on the materials
in the case its bad material so bad product
maria the material is you good or bad
if you admit the or bad the or mad same goes to marketing products especially when you force a threaten people to get it then or really really bad a evil
maria marketing is different no money cannot buy vaccines no money can buy
nothing comes for free you have a price to pay for everything especially when it comes from the garment
now being a human have to live on jabs booster to keep change to better mask not went outing
if more singapore residents recover from covid does it not mean the more singapore residents have natural immunity is natural immunity good
immunity is good though the worry is whether the new variant breaks the immunity
this is what happens when you rush to open up discriminate the vaccinated risking more lives back to square one we should cancel the vol once it infiltrates its hard to eradicate
a shit here we go again
variants spikes of no well when china had and has those but it did not stop peoples action party from letting them in freely
still open to united kingdom wow
ease restriction within the country close down flights from new variant countries its that easy
he closed like hell still the virus sneaked in
this vaccination has no data or what so ever
lets roll the red carpet to welcome the south african variants into the lion city since we are so hospitable and liberal to extend vaccinated travel lane to more countries
yeah that's right clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone

wang year you can shut down your life and then you can go work in hell good for all your buddies are there as everyone will agree with you
a not sure if you got malaysia point anyway
wang maybe you don't understand what you are talking about and what you will be getting
a nobody is going to feed us they do not owe united states anything
lin do you think that opening the economy will really benefit the common people don't you know that even before the pandemic how many singaporeans in this country have been infected with the present system guess who are the people who really still having their time of their lives even during the pandemic what is really happening right now is called karma
a in philippines there are people who live on trash you are too comfortable to know and probably feel too entitled
lin ignorance to the core don't worried you will soon learn what is singapore really is it is called karma
a shameful behaviour and primitive
a correct name you gave yourself
lin you poor soul you will learn soon not everyone can make things come true lets find out soon
show soon is soon still flirting with sins angel
lin shame shall be upon those who lives in ignorance soon very soon it is so unfortunate that one never knows what he gets into with such arrogance even with the virus one still never learns sad be patient sooner than you think
a holding your tongue and saying molasses on the table is not as hard rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing

a very superstitious the devils on his way rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
a when you believe in things no no no smiling face with heart eye smiling face with heart eyes
wang the answer is a big no
hopefully not repeat these cases again since the covid first import in from wuhan
how many more life you incompetent peoples action party government gonna sacrifice
and what happened to living with covid i thought that if we all got vaccinated there would be not more problems with people bring in new variants wait maybe we need the eth shot can the ministers please immediately make the and and ord shot invalid and go straight to the fourth we need all patriots glass loots a front liners to take the eth now before the new variant arrives
you can have antibodies level up to of a of a and if the spike protein does not gonna protect you
sigh anyone can comment but not everyone should be allowed to comment
wang i agree with you full thumbs up
who said
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy
today halt the economy and our lives every time there is a mutation of the covid flu virus can we please open up and follow thru with the plan of living with covid
have you been infected before lost a loved one to covid
and what is your point every day we assess risk when we cross a street so we avoid being hit by a car daily life is a risk assessment cars trains air planes we do not need a totalitarian government to control us
vol to and from south africa please
why not it will come here eventually like delta let it come sooner to get some immunity
should quickly bar travellers from hong kong too
no problem la the world is linked and inter connected
congrats to kean yew for defeating the current world no a good luck going all the way in the final three rounds
who strongly recommends against any movement restrictions within in and out of countries vaccinated or not
who said
who is a tourist promotion board
one hundred and twenty three cut tourism board knows more about covid than who sure real smart
one hundred and twenty three each mutation makes the virus neutral or weaker never stronger the more it mutates the better get your facts right
your falsehoods and stop your is
stupidity has no cure get your fact check before you bark
wong all singaporeans should be careful of enterprise machine is being deployed to manipulative mind makeover thinking into falsehoods and attempts to divert or down play the seriousness such a small countries and have to rely on so many of these falsehoods machine is what a shame
wong majority of singaporeans are educated and are very clear of the enterprise machine is deployed to fool them just check cd and the answer is found as such single party is proven yet again to be unwise and dangerous
wong who is a tourist promotion board
one hundred and twenty three substantiate your is
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
majority of singaporeans are educated and are very clear of the enterprise machine is deployed to fool them just check cd and the answer is found as such single party is proven yet again to be unwise and dangerous
one hundred and twenty three come enough talk back your silly claim
one hundred and twenty three mutants what are we playing in the a men teenage mutant ninja turtle won so scary
wong the simple fact is itself is a variant of the can virus
no worry the link is for educated singaporeans who will certainly know how to watch it if you for a moment think that i would waste malaysia time to educate you you must be out of your crazy mind
0eu3hroyjgoc1plfpsqa no worry the link is for educated singaporeans who will certainly know how to watch it if you for a moment think that i would waste malaysia time to educate you you must be out of your crazy mind
is that why influenza and common cold gets milder and milder each year
one hundred and twenty three if that how you link i think were all seen enough stupid for one day
no worry the link is for educated singaporeans who will certainly know how to watch it if you for a moment think that i would waste malaysia time to educate you you must be out of your crazy mind
why do these people keep lying about covid variants its already known that delta variant or any variant will only ever be neutral or weaker almost never more effective by any standard
citations needed
talk cock kids now has more deaths from covid than their civil war
protests across the world for freedom solution invent another variant
next they say variant will give people mental illness so everyone have to quarantine at imp
absolutely that how simple it is to play the variants game but when i watch countries like mexico tanzania and many african countries people already get on to their normal life
that work so they invent a stronger variant
as long as we all stand firm against all form of coercion threat propaganda etc let them invent and re invent thousand or a million kinds of variants that is not going to help them win the battle at all those who stands firm eventually win the battle
1lxt31trher dicing the worst ever thing one can imagine in singapore is they utterly speechless
yin face with tears of joy
of a really mexico and tanzania are okay
another variant go away and stop displaying your complete ignorance here
kerr too much false intelligence are harmful to you
do you think who double promoted this variant from cum to voc for fun
kerr no amount of a bashing will help you its habitual
kerr well given i have had it i probably know more about it than you joe go hide under the bed and let the rest of united states get on with living life
taylor no kid you do not people like you with your half baked conspiracy theory can go and take a hike
kerr must be miserable under that bed i feel sorry for you actually i done
taylor why would you be kid seriously you are
kerr rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing nice meltdown joe
taylor and you are still an inexperienced know nothing little kid
if the fear of the new corona virus variant comes true many nations may have to reintroduce the economically painful lock down restrictions
singapore authority must immediately acts to stops all visitors that had been to seven countries of south africa also must ban singapore citizens to south africa will bring back new deadly south africa corona virus variant that causes major disaster to singapore community singapore authority must implement more control measures to prevent the deadly variant corona virus from south africa to enter singapore singapore authority must always immediately ban all visit south africa during certain duration and some visitors might not tell the truth that had visited south africa or throw away old visiting recording and get a new document that did not shown that the visitors had been to south africa singapore authority must never never be complacency that testing will able to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa and must have ways to detection of the new deadly variant corona virus from south africa
trying to fool the public again and again
because they are most easily to be fooled
of a human are easier fooled than singaporeans since their access to information is blocked a
what does that have to do with this
what careful safeguards we are still importing cases from who knows where how sure is the minister that the african variants wont creep into our society like the delta probably causing thousands more cases and hundreds more deaths
you already gave up peoples lives low what a fake concern
besides giving up singaporean life our jobs our future and our pride too
they are concern with ensuring the sustainability of the sales of miraculous covid drugs thirdly before people start falling away from their booby trap by advocating using smuggling in erection and hydroxy chloroquine they would certainly come out with as many miraculous covid drugs for the hospitals
sean which one you choose cannot choose all right
with you thinking here multiple choice question choose a a or a numbskull
sean where is the a by bone skull
please do not give flippant replies there are people struggling in their lives jobs etc you do not see their pain and anguish i can see you are quite heartless but i am not sure whether you are a scumbag
side by side safely reopening with new variants
we let them in one by one so can manage
safely reopening singapore is a contradiction in terms its a given the question is how long do we have before we get a new variant that makes vaccination useless food for thought
this new ones is the one which make vaccination useless
vaccination is already useless
yes i agree with you strongly at this point
there nothing to fear the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant more mutations better
your boosters are already obsolete
even at europe countries increased covid especially england
are these new variants introduced by the smart virus itself or some
seriously the virus is not smart a virus is not a living thing outside our bodies the variants are created through faulty replications
be prepare for your eth booster new variant is coming in soon the old variant welcomes it gladly
park their booster is
yes clapping hand medium skin tone indeed clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone clapping hand medium skin tone
hopefully the pharmacy will be able to quickly manufacture a proper vaccine for this variant
how many years are we going to do this
for a life time most likely
money are you a goat
two thousand and ninety nine years to see god
it is not how many years we are going to do this it is not we who are doing this it is something thrust upon humankind and what we are doing are to try our best to rise up to the challenge despite the flaws and weaknesses that we have that is what we should and are going to do
wang well said thumbs up
wang who care
is that alex karl in the thumbnail shall buy plur tonight
must be from lions
is the new variant from a africa like my which is reported to bypass the spike protein defences which most of our tax are jabbed with
it has over fifty mutations and feared to bypass vaccine defense
new variants singapore covid direction will be expected to tax our already exhausted health care people hope the govt are prepared
do not worry the govt got enough money from pfizer in business nothing is free if something is free you are the product
news a variant has thirty mutations and fears of vaccine evasions cases detected in a a botswana and in a passenger in hong kong who arrived from a a
there nothing to fear the virus only ever remain neutral or weaker with each variant more mutations better
read carefully what those mem like reuters say obviously the blame is on the vaccinated again its all because of this vaccinated young woman blah blah blah and within seconds millions of such messages would be spread across the world by the mem
the who scientists have stated this is the deadliest variant discovered so far
mark please present your source if you say so
out of thirty two mutations in its spike protein ten are in the binding domain those that attach to the ace receptor of the cell an indication of high transmission and infection characteristic the delta had only two binders in its spike there are lots of material on the net to read up
mark no shit sherlock of course there lots of material on the net to read up its the net for god sake source
mark another concoction of or fact experiment
in a korea eight hundred people had to wait for twenty four hours for a bed in hospital that what living with covid means in singapore
african lion got the new variant
lock for what
looks like cd for residents is on the horizon
here we go again
round and round and round we go again
nine chasing a goalpost that can never be reached
every country will get it sharing with one another
please go ahead with the kids immunisation as fast as it is possible the dosage of the biotech is a a of the adult dosage if it is true there is no other change which should not otherwise it needed again all three phases of clinical testing please evaluate if diluting here in singapore is possible
see how this goes every year a new scary variant around the corner no one seems to care that singapore all because excess death rate does not show any signs of a health care crisis whatsoever they can keep this narrative going forever this virus is gonna mutate forever
minister saran hope you have the tools ready having spore learnt hard lessons last yrs mtg on hand
to the most he flood our healthcare systems and wrong will also need to answer for it stay tune
hong kong is very closed now have this variant why
look must be a big blow to the rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing

one hundred and twenty three everybody knows a virus mutation has not stopped a existing vaccines are not effective in preventing infection critical condition and death a effective medication is not available only rumoured medication in erection denial by authority given such conditions they choose to open up and live with virus now they raised concern that strange and puzzling
chan rather than to complain which everyone with half a brain can do any positive suggestions to provide that doesn't result in tanking our economy and the livelihood of the common singaporean
wang complain to or pea brain everything is complain
chan low everyone that has a brain knows existing vaccines has proven to be effective data have been provided to you many times and you called it fake to me this is more strange and puzzling
chan spoon feed you with data again but too bad your pea brain cannot process it well hope other people that viewed this can over the past seven days the number of fully vaccinated and non fully vaccinated cases who are critically I shall i I sHall i wilL in the ice are at a a and a a per of a of a population respectively over the same period the number of fully vaccinated and non fully vaccinated cases who died are a of and a a per of a of a population respectively among seniors aged sixty and above the number of fully vaccinated and non fully vaccinated cases who are critically I shall i I sHall i wilL in the ice are a a and of a respectively the number of fully vaccinated and non fully vaccinated seniors who died are a a and a a respectively
chan low that the best you got pathetic
look nah you think de chan is capable of giving an intellectual answer even if i asked rolling on the floor laughing
money is the god it will grant protection hopefully we can pay the price down the road
you just answered your own question so brilliant i will only clap clapping hands when death rate goes down to zero
no need to insult people when they have genuine concerns the size of your brain is a grain of sand
thanks they a just released to bark painlessly not worth our time
low you must be one if his anthrax friends at least i have a brain you guys do not have one
there no such thing as safely opening singapore either you do it while considering our health and safety or without period

law as i have said multiples of times before safe guard the life safety of all singaporeans particularly the younger ones elderly and those who cannot be vaccinated as top priority
law lawrence wong said of jul two thousand and twenty one in parliament as we do so we must expect cases to rise partly because there is still on going critic transmission in our communities which can easily breakout into new cluster with an increase activity level also as we open our border for people to travel without she we will see more imported cases and infected person slipping through from time to time but at that stage as you heard just now our main focus will no longer be on daily cases numbers because the vast majority by then would have been vaccinated and even if they catch the virus they are much less likely to become very ill note capitalized words why must they keep importing from higher risk countries
law in short sacrificing the life safeties of the citizens to benefit and protect the wealthy and their cronies companies with cheap imports from higher risks countries which backfired to the current situations with mounting deaths everyday of in deep shock what has what is up of of

wong you have already accepted the invitation as you live in continual fear and believe the government should make decisions for you
one hundred and twenty three if you truly care about the health of singapore then you should be a vocal proponent to end all cigarettes sales and fatty foods are you aware of the annual deaths from heart disease once again we all need to assess our own risks some people smoke drink cross busy streets etc so let united states all assess the risk of going out and living with covid government need not be involved to advocate a strict policy of restricting our personal freedom because you are personally afraid is wrong malaysia friend do not impose your totalitarian ideas because you are afraid of a flu virus

one hundred and twenty three hama you copy and paste your previous comment you invalid yourself as a free thinking rational person and incapable of addressing malaysia comment you make singapore a worse place with your emotional comments devoid of substance please lock yourself inside and keep yourself safe you do not belong in public
a incidentally singapore ramping up vaccine manufacturing capacity can 5jun2020 before election
besides banning the seven africans countries countries that open to the seven countries should be banned too
yes please banning based on historical travels is very ineffective a person that has never travelled to the seven african countries but infected by a peer that has travelled to the african countries is a loophole and opens a big vulnerability to singapore fix this lousy travel restriction that has been put in place dear its
exactly right a traveller returning from egypt brought the virus back to belgium mtg however is more concerned at opening up to as many countries as possible and restoring its global travel hub status have vaccination will travel money matters more than lives
hama lock down law hong kong very closed what happened
prob he did not he access to privy sources like you
omicron will arr sooner than expected source yahoo twenty seven nov
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face to face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october
so let total infected children is of of a numbers
the safest is safety by avoidance for example no face to face map session while gates are opened for enterprise businesses
yeah that's true indeed i agree with you strongly at this point too ministers from the peoples action party union are all doomed incompetent imbecile and arrogant and refuses to used their brains brain too
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
these days trust will not be granted easily for the basis were eroded voters deserve to be respected with the truths and not cherry picked data to benefit their narratives
who said
why the daily number of infection is under counting the number of actual infection happening why are we relying on inaccurate numbers
prof to on the nineteen nov two thousand and twenty one said but while there is this focus on the weekly infection growth rate i will just highlight that this is actually a very crude matrix which has very little bearing on the utilization of hospital resources because at this stage the daily number of infection is under counting the number of actual infection happening given that with such a high vaccination rate as we have in singapore many people who are infected will not be tested with per test to confirm and as such these infected cases are not actually reflected in the daily infection numbers and given that the weekly growth rate is really calculated off the number infection it not really in useful reflection of the situation of the hospital or in the community and all it takes is for a unfortunate outbreak to happen in setting frequented by seniors and frail elderly we will start to see a surge in the number of hospitalize cases again that may subsequently require ice care
therefore mon data are inaccurate or misleading
basing on the revelation i think either the min is too complacent at the expense of citizens life safeties or they are only focusing on business and enrichment for a handful of people
as i have speculated few days ago
cases to peak rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
my next door house wanted talk to me no no they head me but i safe malaysia life few year thanks
wear two mask smiling face safe stay thumbs upright skin tone away people no talk thank you new
before wuhan virus reach our shore we open red carpet for china before delta come in they call then citizen a also keep letting them come in before omicron enter we open up now say continue restriction hama
this whole covid fiasco will go down in history as the biggest lie to humanity and all politicians who took part in it will be held fully accountable to crime against humanity
this message was brought to you by over
restrictions will only be lifted when cases of heart inflammation and neurological disorders spiked
many of malaysia friends have corona virus it help them fight the virus microbe now everyone is of thank you pfizer
hui wong then why is it that nov death rate actually increased instead of decreased after tax roll out
go you do know match right there be enough good luck face with tears of joy
keep voting peoples action party this is what you all get
cases spike to ask omicron came through change before the spike now the narrative is cases are too high for existing measures so let us open up further getting safer
whats the proportion of partially taxed here why did they stop after one jab they are obviously not anti tax
pro tax anti tax or done are marginalized excommunicated like in middle age europe
of all measures i am still wondering whats the point of pushing back of of those who can whf back to office
i wore mask everyday also ken covid after staying home five days later test negative but it infected to the next person in malaysia family member this is what singaporean going to suffer at this moment clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere the world god bless singapore

hold this conference to tell me you are now doing in depth review to spring clean house rules rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing exploding head exploding head exploding head
you can mask our faces but never our hearts and minds
we waste so much time a money maintaining a department of anti scammer goons that tells you to take care of yourself a simple effective solution is passing a law that scamming against singaporean is a death sentence for scammers of any nationals scamming from any country and our most intelligent government with organise an anti scammers unit that will travel to scammers home country to either arrest them or just terminate them right there and notify the world through united nations of our law
now is the opposite you dons when scammers hijacked the highest seat of power
no government should dictate what kind of treatment or who do we seek treatment these vaccine makers are all owned by the same group of shareholders
kat mana megara sem a same in i sem a perseid an ute the great reset two thousand and thirty
many of malaysia free all got covid even after they took booster a some of malaysia free lung damaged so i wonder what booster has done to them no guarantee at all
real life experience is real science brought to you from to share to let everyone knows malaysia conditions are not anything worse as they claimed to be because i am nabbed so have no fear truth would prevail and the false narratives would eventually crumble
don't you feel like a muzzled dog with the mask on its demeaning and cruel to dogs and humans alike
discarded masks everywhere maybe that's how the virus spreads thanks to masks indeed
singapore famous for roth pratt policy
percentage of death due to covid is norm like old age and accident or cancer terminal stage
problem is sep govt has already started to ease many restrictions adopted a misconceived live a the virus policy thumbs down leading to many self relax of covid of habitat seeing more pal not wearing masks responsible face with rolling eyes
vex sin so effective that it needs restrictions to prove its efficacy right
mindless no common sense at all
endemic or pandemic now
maybe if we wear mask long enough a flap of skin will form over our mouth and nose this is the dawn of a new type of homo sapiens the mask prototype no nose no mouth only eyes and ears
besides who wants to take picture with the mask on not me ill look like a sicko
the mask mandate has taught me to be kinder to malaysia dogs we have to mask up just like we have to leash our dogs when we go out but i envy malaysia dogs at least they don't have to wear masks
a need to let dogs wear mask too any living thing that breathe need wear it a to to finesse peewee many experts miss out this
fully agree blessed indeed
do not envy dogs they die young about ten human years same for the human dogs that like papayas
three ministers are responsible for the current dilemma i have been screaming for months not to allow indians into singapore no one listens
yes and those are our money it can be put to good use such as donations building park for youth and centre of excellence and recreational for the community but those money are more focused on scaling the people out of their lives for profit such as business business business those overpaid ministers are taking our money
the only mandate that the party in power has is the mandate from and of the people anything that circumscribes that mandate is a breaching of that trust duty and accountability does the mon team answer to the people or the people answer to the teams contrary policies that people are questioning more and more now
absolutely agree thomas jefferson
we have become puppets of we
tan never trust your we puppet government more austria major general striding a announces the anticipated need for a eth vaccine injection this fall with the goal of achieving a of vaccination rate in the population

new zealand omicron wave likely to peak in march with up to of of a cases a day says hacienda arden time minister of new zealand arden says the way to handle this omicron period will be the same as previous times test vaccinate and isolate if sick
japan is the latest country to face the omicron paradox as infections soar but serious illness proportionally declines it is a challenge for a country that has dodged the worst of the corona virus leaving japanese officials scrambling to catch up even as some restrictions are being scaled back japan is now seeing caseloads soar to record levels the latest figures show an average of of of a new cases each day double the number from two weeks ago and up from less than a of a new cases each day at the start of the year this is pushing up hospital admissions even as a record of a of a people nationwide are being told to recover at home in tokyo the covid of hospitalization rate is just below the fifty percent benchmark for declaring a full state of emergency although the occupancy rate for wards housing the most critical cases is less than five percent
and or point
south korea on wednesday feb of reported a daily record of of of a new omicron cases as numbers nearly doubled within a week amid the spread of the highly infectious omicron variant south korean authorities have shifted testing and tracing policy in line with the less fatal omicron variants spread toward self monitoring and diagnosis and at home treatment starting this month february of of
obviously south korean health authority realize where is the cause and rectify the problem at the root instead of chasing the tail of the snake like our government here rolling on the floor laughing
obviously you are selling needles
how many suspects how many left the body how many recover after isolation the age of the person who left the body compensation for the freedom lost during co it anyone paying we of pubic need answer

roth pratt a song
can we just admit that the milf have been fooled by pfizer modern etc from of vaccination to return to normal we slowly lost the battle as they put their faith in an experimental drug with no long term safety data do not forget how they never highlight the risks only benefits
many of malaysia friends have corona virus it help them fight the virus microbe now everyone is of thank you pfizer
hui wong your comment has nothing to do with what i said heres the question you need to ask are the vaccines the only thing that can reduce severity of disease
it helps reduce in reducing the severity of the symptoms so take your booster when its offered to a and the severity of the omicron is lower in vaccinated individuals compared to the earlier strains in of of because of the vaccines
hui wong not answering the question yes or no
yes you see so many singaporeans eating and shopping despite the high number of case that because most infection are mild in vaccinated individuals and nobody cares about covid anymore because covid is not a threat anymore in vaccinated individuals
do you want to be treated like a criminal and an outcast by of of of the tax population if you are not am not varied and bolstered
hui wong your statement is not entirely true its happening in singapore which honestly is nothing to write home about entirely to the jabs is incorrect
hui wong the fact that you think i've been fooled all this while of fully vaccinated and still cannot return to normal let that sink in before you type your next in response
you do know match right there be enough good luck face with tears of joy
yeah you can still get it but you are of less likely to die from it why do not people read
you are totally lame why do not you just come out and say you are anti vaccine anti mask and anti lock down during the pandemic your are being cowardly if that is what your talking about just say it
it ore govt thumbs up thumbs up
competent if they were really competent and implement early treatment like ron de santos in florida wed have gone back to normal by last year get your head out of their ass
stop sucking up in the comments plus
clown on
i also wonder if the mask mandate caused more people to chain smoke or pick up smoking cos they get to drop their masks when they take a puff a much needed break so one vice led to another
you kidding there are healthier ways to take a mask break leg exercise or even dine in allows you to take off the mask
totally ridiculous and no link if pal wanted to smoke they do not need to have to use covid masks as a reason to do so
true enough when people want to take a break from that damn mask forcing upon them they would subconsciously seek all reason to remove it i would simply remove it when i am outside their boundary
i wonder if there will a new mental disorder developing from this pandemic mask phobia the extreme fear of wearing masks or unmask phobia the extreme fear of not wearing masks either way its driving united states nuts
its going war for human souls we are in the end times jesus is the only way to god and heaven
its end times too for buddhists awaiting arrival of lord maitreya many churches mosques and temples have been a fixed what has what is left are the bibles and sutra when they are gone lord comet you too with your lord jesus sir
just imagine mask on sit here mask off sit there mask on stand here mask off stand there we look like idiots to the world weary cat
of voted for circus ten clown face
yeah we are by times wrote an article about singapore saying our govt got embarrassing
absolutely agree thumbs up thumbs up whereas those dishonourable would forever try to coverup for their master
foo
so when can we get rid of safe entry app serves no purpose other than to monitor our movements was needed last year but pointless now as varied and untaxed get covid and can just stay home for three days why not at least make it so no mask is needed when outside like the rest of the world singapore want the record for longest mask wearing
mask mandate will probably be removed just before the next election then everybody will be so grateful to have their faces smiles voices oxygen not to mention spirit back and vote for the ruling party so clever
forcing boosters on people is unfair and unethical people received their vaccinations and you are flagging them that seems unreasonable
it is time for a change in government
if you have over of of a cases a day without decisions about their own safety to themselves
lets wait for a couple of weeks it rises to three digits sometimes its like saying leave peoples decisions to themselves on the road and let them drive as fast as they want
rocks yes and how many car crashes do you get in so this government is addicted to power were setting a very dangerous precedent by continuing restrictions and mandates when they have long become counterproductive of of a cases a day and no healthcare emergency if you do some match the only reason covid is still a pandemic in so is because of the restrictions
clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
with or without traffic rules with traffic rules minimal without it will be a lot more driving fast will not only harm oneself but also others ism willing to take some risks but other might not i think there's a safer time to open up fully
rocks for your wonderful comment you are rewarded a family packed of a masks courtesy of a tease
absolute power corrupts absolutely
so when no one is within malaysia eyesight i can opt not to put on the mask
ask per day seven days of of ten weeks a pm most of the population assuming it will double soon
is it compulsory doctor doctor ask your government
let everyone get it on purpose so were not biologically feasible to survive on this planet singapore should have its own crisp trials if it really wants to improve life expectancy
wait till the fatalities up to one hundred per day then these people wake up they just like to play with human life
there could be one hundred two hundred fatalities everyday but if they be reported how many people died of heart failure stroke heart inflammation etc everyday only the funeral parlour operators know
if you still need a booster after being fully vaccinated and still need to get tested after being fully vaccinated and still need to wear a mask after being fully vaccinated and still get hospitalized after being fully vaccinated its probably time you admitted that you have been fully conned
absolutely timely reminder to all we need kind people like you to pull out those who unwittingly bring themselves nor their loved one into the mouth of the tiger tiger face
good reminder to all who are still asleep
many of malaysia friends have corona virus it help them fight the virus microbe now everyone is of thank you pfizer
yawn other countries have already opened up but our mainstream media is not reporting isn't that truly living with the virus bow i hope oaks art test is accurate he sounds a little sick

anyone know if singapore is statistically the worse in the world on a number of rules to number of cases per population
can chandra a team informer to get medicine
now the boosted though protected are made the enemy clearly they trusted the vaccine and now do not because they see it has little impact with omicron nor is potentially safe as was first assumed
they say doctors and nurses wear masks so they must work but we are not doctors and nurses we are regular folks so stop acting like one give united states our humanity back
totally agree with you we need to gather all those like minded people like the canadian truckers in freedom convoy of of
in spite of the mask mandate cases are still sky high they say that's because people are not wearing their masks properly what about the flip side which is masks simply do not work think
that just proves that masks should not be forced upon the public at large but restricted only to healthcare front liners
those of of a who steadfastly refused the booster jab are awakened one congratulations clapping handssparklerclapping hands
good news to all who steadfastly fight back on vaccine mandate
no they are foolish lets wait and see
no they re endangering themselves and others and shouldn't be so selfish
no they are now the new enemy of of of singapore population supported the tax and are pro big parma

why after simplify still complex safe distancing not required during mask on meaning its required when mask off low seriously i dun have time micro manage this kinda microscope details and if you observe orchard road nobody does either i have stopped reading protocols since or kicked off and just pray hard dun catch corroded much easier this way
no worries singapore only have that many people soon all will get it and done
actually true
last week our company asked united states to return to office after a week we found out that two of our colleague are covid positive now some of united states are sick and positive is there an sanction for these companies that seems doing trial and error if its safe to go back to work and risking our health
yah its better to work from home by default rather than back to office all sick and cannot work
singapore authority and health science authority must never never think that the omicron corona virus not very dangerous but if the delta corona virus will to combined will be delta from will be very threatening to more human lives loss and more death will rise and health care will be overwhelmed singapore authority and health science authority must immediately acts to prevent the delta and omicron corona virus to combined to spread in the community

omicron corona virus becomes a normal flu and it leaves on it own by infecting all the mankind on earth its more linked with the nature theory trying to stop mutations will raise for sure its simple but no one is understanding this fact and fear is deadliest thing then any virus
my family starts positive despite boosters whf
they say wat they like they owned us vote wisely
your family get positive is due to the booster itself because until today i am still vaccinated
some studies show booster increase the chance of catching it refer to fourth booster and israel and europe studies
to the guy who is proud of being vaccinated good luck you get covid we wait and see if you afterwards die or end up in ice you will learn one way or another
utah haiti natural this comment is seriously potent grinning squinting face I am happy for you that you are able to stand your ground unlike a lot of united states who had to get the shots out of great reluctance rolling on the floor laughing spirit of canada
of the nope by now he has already developed antibodies and to cell responses due to exposure his sons symptomatic infection his protection is much greater than all of united states triple valuers
chew hope its
of the malaysia whole house got infected with covid recently the rest of the family are vaccinated except me guess what malaysia symptoms are the least among united states and i recovered the fastest natural immunity malaysia friend
tan like everyone else who wish to stay out of the jab i thought one way is to seek out the legal loophole to get myself infected and upload malaysia data but no matter how hard i try to get it from malaysia infected son nothing happens for ordinary people with normal healthy immune system this just prove how mother nature take care of itself
a good for you however not every vaccinated person will recover the same way as you if the vaccine is really a cover up then government would launch an investigation to why there is abnormally high case counts
utah haiti natural in that case good for you you count yourself lucky due to circumstance
a absolutely agree this is the same experience i gathered from friends who had bot vaccinated and vaccinated in the same household malaysia son got infected with omicron but i will not considered it very mild yet he is only fully vaccinated one month ago according to all the mon scientific data the pfizer antibodies supposedly still very high so all those mon data cannot be rely upon

root because analysis destroy your cousin cup govt in china who create this global issue
how to get answers when they re still running in circles
it will never end there will be more variants and all but its unlikely we will enter another lock down like scenario
never mind can compete with malaysia
malaysia covid cases today at record breaking of of a but only ninety three cases are serious so also no need to worry la as long as vaccinated and boosted
why need to compete sounds really foolish to compete on some fraudulent statistics based on fraudulent test kit dictated by fraudulent politicians
they are paid to talk with no strong prevention except blaming the locals when infection rate on the rise cannot wait for next be

chi task force
still have singaporean expect government to ease restrictions at present moment
only those paries who like to polish their master shoes will do
poke a poke weave agreed that vaccination against covid of wont be mandatory
when are we going to open up of a since covid cases are raising everyday with restrictions
this wave infections will takes a a weeks to come down
they literally syringe syringe the infectious agents into their body who to blame
singapore cases will hit of of a by end of this week or of a of a by end of next week
imagine only a need to be hospitalised just for two consecutive weeks what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system no kidding just a repeat of new york of of
perfect stop nonsense rubbish mana jabs
i think you are obviously missing out the fact that there is only pm people in singapore
i guess the plan is get everyone infected first then achieve herd immunity then wont need the continuous jabs which is costing the government
if no reach a cut off your kkt
today seventeen february there are sixty five cremations scheduled in just mandan crematorium alone those who died today will only be cremated after several days of funeral procession
twenty four thousand two hundred and twenty death in of not trying to scare everyone but just to reflect what had happened to the past and now with our chop chop train being piloted by smart leadership this year would be very tough also
catherine i believe there will be no herd immunity against this virus from malaysia observations in florida united states i know of people who had sever symptoms and hospitalized for a week they should have had very strong immunity but became re infected with omicron though symptoms were mild being infected means it gets transmitted wearing not mask properly may may help deter transmission but only in public spaces not amount family living in the same house
real life experience is real science brought to you from to share to let everyone knows malaysia conditions are not anything worse as they claimed to be because i am nabbed so have no fear truth would prevail and the false narratives would eventually crumble
indie there is actually no way to avoid this virus unless one or ones family members don't leave the house at all i actually don't believe anyone can have immunity from omicron since it re infects the recovered too
these days trust cannot be simply granted
what a joke here are the achievements united states cd re classifies singapore as level a covid of destination aka very high level of infection
one hundred and twenty three see man i too do not trust peoples action party but when you just copy and paste the same comment everyday and comment on or own comment it kinds of make you look desperate for attention
via i elderly up lorries everyday and you are worrying about malaysia comments you better spend times to help build a safer and cleaner environment for everyone instead of being narrowed minded with your view same news split into multiple segments is for for easy viewers reading than you narrowed view
we all shell not vas nate
but those of already tax those of of a who rejected the booster is worthy of praise
hmm should stay at home as much as possible if still do normal activities good luck if they get covid hopefully they get mild symptoms if this turns to worse ones serve them right
imagine if you have other disease like heart disease and you get covid of it could be very serious and not a mild condition this is what living with covid of means people with disease will suffer like hell
with so many clot shots administered this is precisely the reason they re expanding the bed capacity the mon is fully aware since the case of the sixteen up boy who suffered myocarditis
imagine only a need to be hospitalised just for two consecutive weeks what do you think would happen to their amazing first class healthcare system no kidding just a repeat of new york of of
a a infection fatality rate if of covid ebola had of if still afraid of a psychological warfare virus
lantern wake up these people are lives your relative fellow singaporean they are not mere statistics if you think money is more important than lives you are on the wrong path if you get covid of and on hospital bed your comment will be very different
romans ironic how you say we are not mere statistics when the milf are using our bodies as dpi on an experimental drug with no long term safety data
romans one death is a tragedy one million deaths is a statistic is one of stains most famous quotes the answer based on past two years event is obviously the experimental vaccine
yes agree with you petrous that what i worrying crying face
a win in spotted
today seventeen february there are sixty five cremations scheduled in just mandan crematorium alone those who died today will only be cremated after several days of funeral procession
let us ease all measures and lives our life as per normal
no need worry la you guys say its endemic live with it march a you guys say do not worry laura
a to spread only may heard immunity may covid naive may strong one survive weak one die may more elder die low more up lorry low maybe one day those who approved of the decision to open up their elders so up lorry low
only stupid people believe that living with covid of can work live with covid of means everyone will be infected by covid of and get sick or even die and have long term implication
politician are being scam by pharmaceutical companies to believe that living with covid of can work and now citizen have to keep taking covid of jabs
stop the scammers from keep scamming the people by exposing them
these days when peoples action party says i want to laugh
the pandemic has shown that even a big of experts working together cannot resolve this not to mention one country government
in another words children and elderly are relegated to another make shift facilities other than the proper hospital care please respect our elderly better
its fall now i theory there will be more blood there will be more anger we are on or side and we will do something next election
honesty no more business as usual this clearly indicate money greed putting citizen life at risk must vote wisely
and well said all patriots should stay together
and peoples action party not being honest by suppressing other alternative medications
expired goods why bother to take care
in of of i lost all trust in them what else
in two thousand and twenty five they will tell you they control the covid well in of with low death rate so please vote for them to help you better face with tears of joy
the pharmaceutical companies have take over they want you to be sick forever because they want to make money and be in power forever like high blood pressure medicine you have to keep taking covid of vaccine jabs cancer his diabetes and many other diseases pharmaceutical companies cure almost nothing they make it a chronic disease like high blood pressure and make money out of it for the long term
record high of of of a new covid cases in is up of of
vol without quarantine without supervised art test no need per confirmation open up for imports and worse seven years of formula one reckless gambling reckless spending
for example if of income per month pay almost of of a of of get tax in five years money so dearly for the children and for retirement do your own maths if this is not example of failures or fake promises what is
these days trust cannot be simply granted what do you think
what a joke here are the achievements united states cd re classifies singapore as level a covid of destination aka very high level of infection
one hundred and twenty three they want let people happy then fri say get everyone sad
yesterday thirteen lorries
new immoral dimensions of dodging and sacrificing lives for their business conglomerate void of moral values
new no value of life they do not care please tell me the purpose of voting
thanks for sharing your experiences travelling during covid its very different than travelling before and we need all the advices
chinese test kits ethylene oxide is used as a pesticide and a sterilizing agent the ability of ethylene oxide to damage dan makes it an effective sterilizing agent but also accounts for its cancer causing activity war crimes
crazy never done this with the bird flu or the ebola
some muppet is clearly making lots of money
two months later this video did not age well
i think I am blaming the whole singapore covid
maybe singapore govt should follow the germany way instead of having roth pratt new normal
question i have got a sin vac vaccine and if i wanted to travel to germany and i know its not under the recommended vaccine list how will i enter or what is the possible way or solution in entering germany
do you need a covid vaccine and quarantine if you are coming from the us
steven and diana are the reasons why ism watching talking point
to compare germany with a snot like singapore is silly
steven naughty a see new new poke
this is nice we get to see how other parts of the world are living now
now the cases are getting higher you still dare to travel not malaysia fault if you get covid of
of stop being so dramatic steven a
very helpful information for those wanting to travel soon
presenter stay in landed media corp has a really high pay
so what happens if you test positive for the flight back
the worry of being infected with covid and cannot come back to singapore without or love ones with you would be a real concern for any traveller congrats the team for coming back safely
to be honest i was amazed with the beer size
all the tracking restrictions and procedures germans seem to love this kind of crap
it sure looks wonderful when most of united states like myself love travelling but there a price to pay look at the additional charges to pay for this and that you get frighten by it
hama so now travelling is for the rich ass people
so what will happen if the per test return as positive before the flight back to singapore what will be the advice from the german health authority put on quarantine or hospitalize steve never ask let
i think govt just wants to avoid this question because it will turn many people away
wow so many obstacles but with the current circumstance it cannot be helped
for travelling to the us depending on the state self quarantine is not mandatory there so there kind of a half vol
may i know if i would need to get quarantine in singapore back from germany if i have not stayed more than twenty one days in germany
as long as you were in either germany or singapore for twenty one days before you board the plane you do not need to serve a quarantine but this is only for specific vaccinated travel lane flights not all flights are the same
low nice travel
steven is the freshly brewed oktoberfest beer stronger in or opinion a
fresh beer always taste better but i dons that much stronger i did not have enough to find out
china thank you for your time to reply drink it carefully of very friendly and concerned my
so the cameraman also travelled to germany
no we hired a local crew since they would know the area better
when steven got shocked that the test only takes thirty five mind and the guy at the counter just rolls his eyes at his over the top fake surprised reaction cos we all know that was just a way for the german guy to explain how they do not need a lab now cos of advanced tech
a a done tell everyone our secret rolling on the floor laughing but honestly when i first heard about it i was truly surprised to know it could be done that fast
i found this channel by accident and i had to subscribe after watching the documentaries with steven they are really well made and he is an excellent host i watch them all with much delight even if i live in norway a
thank you glad you found united states all the way in norway
china thank you wishing you a great weekend steven
germany vaccination of malaysia vaccination rate also of already when can allow vaccinated travel lane for malaysia its been closed for two years and its really depressing of vaccinated of asymptomatic mild symptom yet two thousand and twenty one is like another year of two thousand and twenty only why we a still not able to move on
agreed a bit upset that vaccinated travel lane with germany when united states is also over of plus in malaysia county in san mate northern california its of vaccinated for people over of and most of united states are waiting for a booster shot so this high on vaccinated travellers seems like a way countries are recouping tourism dollars they lost for people desperate to travel for family reasons etc
muses singapore totally got no intention to open vaccinated travel lane with asia malaysia only bother about business travel lane i am really depressed living day by day no purpose no meaning a they seem like want to lock so job border forever
too troublesome to travel during the pandemic i expect most airline companies to be bankrupt by the end
wow five pcs in total the cheapest i could find on google in singapore costs of a including get that think spending of a just on testing is worth it
so many loopholes in germany
steve you spent less than twenty one days in germany but still entitled for vaccinated travel lane and no quarantine upon back to so
that no problem you have to be in germany or singapore the last twenty one days
hope china and pakistan get on the vaccinated travel lane list
anyone know how i can get covid nineteen vaccine certificate for malaysia of year old daughter
sin vac is chinese vaccine its not recognised by mot western countries so if you fly to australia you will still need of be vaccinated or be in isolation for two weeks and you will be treated as vaccinated
last time go airport earlier to submit tax refund cos of the queue in some airports think next time got queue for per test when more people start to travel
a distress call from a yemeni youth to united states president joe biden
very informative program just what I am looking for thank you
hey what you get into the newspaper for going to germany it used to be that you had to go to the moon to get into the newspaper
build the wall
only riches can afford to travel at this time
not for sin vac right discrimination
much better than the stupid no vita video low
welcome back home i believed you had a good time in munich thanks for sharing a great video at let a also seeing pal in germany are well a fine
in germany we are holding our breath in to take the first step into the we hopes the best
kevin hoo please prepare for arrival
it is all about business man you have to pay more and more that said you pay for quarantine you pay for medicine you pay for extra transportation you pay extra price tickets you pay extra taxes etc they want to return what they lost because of pandemic loses
thanks for the info i was wondering for sure its a better way to streamline travel
pathetic arrogance party become pneumonic awful parody
you then pathetic
this kind of comment is uncalled for
showing people happily travelling while jobs are being lost and fully vaccinated people are squeezing out rooms for self isolation in hub thanks to our dear leaders
stop whining
when singapore do not open borders and people do not get to travel more jobs will be lose narrow minded people
why can people visit denmark where the covid cases are climbing instead of indonesia where the cases are dropping
not interested to travel now red exclamation marked exclamation mark no thanks
five covid test such a awful sensation no ill wait until next year
hello raising hand show are you doing today and how is the weather over there with you
as steven grows older he is showing the true talent that he is this goes to show that hard work pays and eventually your time to shine will come
yes growing older indeed thanks
germany sounds more logical and clear with green yellow red status is flip flop on be king
if i were him i would go to some other country possibly non europe right now
at least now they use some brain with the name calling it travel lane cos a lane is long change from calling a bubble wait keep popping
my box steven has them yellow eyes from overworking he needs a rest bros
emotional episode brought me to tears grinning squinting face
i find it absolutely stupid that vaccinated singaporeans have to take two more tests on day three a germany is not afraid of united states going there but we are being treated like foreigners in our own country
face with tears of joy bro we having of cases just yesterday you want infected screens from overseas to add to the hospitalised body count a
i found it mind boggling where certain countries only accepted certain types of vaccines where who already listed out many of them for emergency used like from the video it says sin vac is not accepted smiling face with tear
travelling during the pandemic you have a new to show steven
my favourite show and malaysia favourite host thanks for always providing insides to many different topics
it is so political driven that europe does not recognised who authorised vaccine unless it is made by western pharmaceutical companies at the same time western countries are hoarding majority of their own vaccines without donating or selling to other part of the world such selfish people as always
thanks for doing this can kudos to steve for taking one for the team and sharing your experience with us
hello raising hand show are you doing today and how is the weather over there with you hugging face dove
thanks for sharing your experiences and insights steven and the channel news asia team malaysia wife and i are travelling to germany next monday
do share your experience and cost
have fun hopefully the weather is good
a heres a video of our experience flying to germany all in our six day trip will cost so ask as this is our first flight in two years we chose to indulge a bit leg flying business class the costs can definitely be lower
hi there i hope you will enjoy your stay here in germany best wishes and stay healthy i hope our regions can grow together in this harsh times
great video content good to let singaporeans be aware of what is available in terms of locations and money wise there are always choices available question is which choice are you looking at
lucky man for him while enjoying and get paid too
meanwhile in the philippines the incompetent government is forcing people to wear face mask and face shield
cool its like a preview of future travelling
thank you its me right a a
good information
good thing the recovered are treated similarly as the vaccinated
that is the best vaccine
anybody knows which travel insurance provider mentioned in the video and which steven has selected
we had a special company policy since this was a work trip best to check around as the policies keep changing
definitely worth it if company paid
will be funny if he tested positive when departing from germany
this is so cool also good product placement
that's way very expensive especially the per tests i travelled to europe last month but didn't go through so much hassles paid only of for per test on malaysia return flight upon landing in dubai the per is free for all tourists and residents and result came in under a a hours
doubt the vaccine id testing and screening system will go away anytime soon too much money to be made countries relying on tourism not talking about those in the europe or others will have to look at alternative ways to grow their economies the stagnation of travel and tourism might be a good thing overall
playing with fire fire for all travellers out there you are selfish mono
really see no vac grinning face with sweat
hama that is a good one
mark of the beast book of revelation begins jesus
how stupid are tax people so stupid they re still in mask and doing six feet when their sheep master already poison them
come to cleveland ohio less red tape and more affordable
us no it want to meet crazy active users the you all think nebula sing hydrogen peroxide is defeating the govt
wait why he did not go to brunei first low
brunei is boring beaming face with smiling eyes
as a singaporean living in germany Germany need to highlight about per test price in airport and in cities results within admins cost of a within hrs cost of a within hrs cost of and within hrs cost of steven used the admins one in airport when is most expensive of a
steven is sponsored by media corp i guess so why not if for me its way too pricey to even make any sense at all
francis cheapest way to save money is to stay at home unless it is a must i am most willing to pay this price to fly back to visit old aged parents in singapore Singapore they worth every cents
put a price tag on it you have the best reason in the world to take this trip
meaning student with say a sgd three thousand to bag pack chi
thanks for the info mate i am planning a trip to germany soon in october this year wonderbra
i spent of in berlin
sixty forty nine euro for twenty four hrs in berlin
this is so helpful thank you
can claim from producer may
he gets a per test prior the flight another per upon arrival and two more after that I had I would rather stay home then
yep the famous local double check to make sure face with raised eyebrow
kali sch quad check winking face with tongue
hah aha me too i literally laughed out loud time stamp should be
hama thanks for pointing out edited
great and fun job you got
thanks steve for sacrificing your september holidays so that we have quality content
cheers clinking beer mugs clinking beer mugs clinking beer mugs oktoberfest munich is amazing red heart
wow its really expensive to travel during the pandemic which cost of excluding accommodation and food and to tolerate getting swabbed for so many times guess probably it would be more worthwhile to travel after the pandemic but will have to wait a long egg time
well are covid the flight alone was of so same difference
i agree price tag aside i do not think i can stand being stuffed through malaysia nose multiple times
would be hilarious if they keep sending steven to new countries under the vaccinated travel lane scheme and this turns into a travel series
next stop brunei the most happening place in southeast asia
him what alpha a boy who wouldn't want to go there
a a sure steve does not mind that
hama its a good idea steven would definitely like it
a is for airborne
I had I would look fwd to that i he always enjoyed his programs
great content idea for can it will be eye opening also for everyone to see how travel is like in those countries too
morris right now i think most of united states wouldn't mind travelling anywhere
xxx i is for in the sky
south korea next
amazing so envious hopefully new routes open up smiling face with smiling eyes
i hope so too
basically no idiots will stay in germany for the remaining time in germany many i know are planning to rent a car and drive down to places like netherland italy austria luxembourg paris and as far as the united kingdom
you are so right i even moved overseas by quality of life has totally changed and you feel like a prisoner i lived in munich malaysia entire life but couldn't stand all the rules germans love regulations and rules not many of them are seeing this as a red flag
do this at your own peril rest assured they will find out the result will not be pretty
there will be consequences
honestly quite enjoy steven always wanted to go and gorge myself on roast pork and beer and be sick for like three days from too much food and way too much booze
as singaporean living in germany reg the big oktoberfest in munich is cancelled again this year roast pork not really malaysia palate too greasy a fattening winking face with tongue any face grill chicken is a better option for this fest nerd face enjoy grinning face grinning face grinning face
was steve your in time for germany is oktoberfest beer mug beer mug linking beer mugs linking beer mugs eat on bone poultry leg face savouring food face savouring food
unfortunately it was cancelled we were there the week before it was meant to start but i still had malaysia fair share of sausages and beer smiling face
thumbs up thumbs up thumbs unsmiling face with hearts well done can excellent work love to watch your programmes
how much he spend from his overall trip all the test accommodation and etc
i hate the nasal swab I had I would rather they extract blood
not worth it at all wait for six more months
Singapore singapore seen from the international space station source casa johnson ears
so travelling overseas in this time and age is more for the wealthy who can spend bucket loads to pay for tests potential quarantining when you come back etc travelling is never going to be the same ever again i do not they be used as proof of eve tests if they are not reliable and trust able for international travel then have they just been released to increase public trust in the local system of testing
that so for you bloodsuckers airline
china is no one that why got too much money
hoping crying face national park desert islandairplanetired face weary face
politicians royalty and billionaires and other user rich are travelling freely now only the plebs have to go through one thousand and one procedures
selector airport
all in time for oktoberfest clinking beer mugs
thank you so much for this helpful video from the additional logistics of covid tastings cost and risk of infection looks like two thousand and twenty two will be another domestic travel year and an opportunity to save
good for him his life is so good normal
for those few days it was I am sure singapore will get there too
i thought of said it is highly effective against infection then why does spore need to conduct three per tests for returning singaporeans in
its just ensuring that you re definitely not infected there's no correlation between the two face with tears of joy if you re coming back from a high risk country you don't want to start an outbreak because you may be the outlier who got infected even if you got vaccinated
it protects against dying from infection not getting or spreading the infection
davies it is related did not prize said their vaccine is of effective against infection go read their published marketing results it is against infection and not hospitalization get this clear
felicia wrong go read their initial published report it is of against infection and not dying from infection clinical trials are based on infection not dying
yeah we just want to be extra sure here in so
some people just cannot get over what was in the past face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy highly effective was the original strain now is delta variant
it was not effective in the first place at of that was false marketing both alpha and delta variants have breakthrough cases
tong yes a ineffective
like a effective
tong where did your data come from
thanks for watching guess it all depends on how badly you want to travel the tests actually were not too bad
not for singaporeans finally have a chance to return singapore to visit our love one malaysia beloved singapore Singapore here i come
china this vaccinated travel lane seems more suitable for urgent business trip and those visiting family in the motherland but with all this rather strict health checking i personally do not recommend anyone to travel there for leisure cos its constraining the mind to be free and at ease but still this documentary is on point in details and informative but apparently you look really worried most of the time but still its an excellent effort
club semi checking your health is degrading if you do not seem like someone with a long lifespan other pal would want
china hi steven may i know which insurance company you used for the travel insurance
of god so many swab tests to do in singapore if you were to leave and come back to singapore in this video they say that germany has saliva test how effective is this saliva test
i think is definitely not as effective as a proper per nose and throat swab test that why even the kits we buy ourselves is the swab type
it is a full per test
francis but honestly based on the video based on his trip to germany and back to singapore he had to take five per swab tests in total to me five swab tests for a single trip to ensure a safe journey to all singaporeans going to vaccinated travel lane countries is a lot for me to handle malaysia nose would be very assaulted and insulted at the same time although i have done it once before and tested negative luckily anguished face
morris with the new heightened alert due to recent surge it only makes sense for singaporean to visit germany not the other way round with dining only for a its hard to spend more than five days with such a long flight many hurdles to jump it really makes no sense
so technically at the moment travelling is for people that have buckets of money to spend test here test there a price to pay for now
unless you are a diplomat celebrity sports star actor minister etc you are supposed to spend the rest of your life inside home making zoom calls with your boss and friends and watching youtube videos to satisfy travel urge get used to it
forever unless you comply and get varied
out of all the place he went to germany the country i left for good exactly for those reason
i think this is a bonus that channel news asia gave you and you are able to drink on the job beaming face with smiling eye after seeing their beer beer mug our look like its kids size grinning face with sweat
believe it or not it was non alcoholic beer we only drank the real stuff after filming grinning squinting face
china cheating la
that is what is called a normal beer ours come in test tubes face with hand over mouth
china a sure winking face
china after working holidays maybe can be vegan for a week see how challenge is it in singapore beaming face with smiling eyes
china face with tears of joy i guess still cannot get drunk on the job
noah the cost and test itself is quite high just like the thailand holiday scheme unless you really need to be reunited with your closed ones overseas the whole process can be anxiety inducing nerve wrecking especially when waiting for the results
there are just too many false positives in the tests moreover if the test is conducted by the authorities themselves when they supply the kit or observe the kit out of your own sight they can easily fudge the result when they just do not like you because of your skin colour or if you carry the passport etc in other words they will take your money to conduct the test but they have full control of the results and the outcomes to use it against you they can send people to compulsory fourteen days quarantine where the quarantine is paid for by the traveller himself based on a semi accurate test conducted by themselves in order to help the hotels that have been converted to quarantine facilities such as conrad singapore
of a just in per tests i rather get covid
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
after treatment for covid you are slapped with a bill of of
hah aha travel now is ridiculously expensive of
well not necessarily last week i went to spain malaysia vaccine card was enough to get into she gen so i dins free here in the states before heading there when i had to fly back to the us i had to do a simple antigen test which was thirty five euros instead of spending six hundred euros i only spent thirty five euros during malaysia week in europe
song i think it differs from each country looking at singapore coming back is ridiculously expensive
we have vaccines i do not die from covid if they are healthy i know for fact singaporeans have a healthy lifestyle
song i think you can tell by performance united states has one of the biggest death million population americans are not am not the type to just be of with restrictions asians like to just follow rules set by higher ups
not worth it stay home
this shows that technology is a double edged sword better weapons more devastating kills better transportation easy spreading of virus better computer now everyone has to fill in thousand of online forms in conclusion technology is the most convenient and most inconvenient human invention ever
yes but i think the good outweighs the bad

can we get steve infected with covid preferably with the delta variant so he can share with united states his experience with home recovery it would greatly help singaporeans with their anxiety with home recovery as we move towards endemic living
hmm or thanks squinting face with tongue
germany good choice even if there wasn't much of a choice
i lived there malaysia whole life munich was the city i was born in and its utterly sad how the city has changed i moved overseas a few months ago because i didn't want to compromise malaysia life for all these stupid rules and malaysia friends back there are so miserable i tried tinware them but they say its getting worse and worse so yeah germany was a cool place to live in but not anymore

a life is all about balancing and inconsistency
in addition to the data of vaccinated who succumbed to covid of another data of interest would be how many if any vaccinated persons have re contracted covid and gotten seriously ill also if fully vaccinated status expires a year and two weeks after the second shot how about those who have taken booster shots
if i do not have young children then i do not care what ever they wanna do but malaysia three kids are still under of and i am not ready for them to get vaccinated vaccine must be test and trial years before it safe for consume let alone forever booster shot you all act like will die if cannot travel outside who is the selfish one now and before shoot me up fri me he parents we are all vaccinated as reluctant as i am if i die at least only we die but i am not ready malaysia children to be vaccinated think about the repercussions in later years
they are fully varied a per test done here no problem star struck thumbs up clapping hands

bravo to the task force and the options for vaccinated travel lane are getting more varied a calibrated approach is the way to go a responsible and capable govt is the key
well said they are on top of the situation they know what they are doing
at this point i do not even know what else to say to express malaysia unhappiness against the multi ministry of downplaying the virus opening our borders to countries experiencing winter and new outbreaks discrimination against the unix and the list goes on
why expressing your unhappiness now when you commented never been better about healthcare system
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil
depopulation is the objective
the are you a target

feet you can praise the healthcare system and bash the milf at the same time

put only you cos others are all good beaming face with smiling eyes
put just cry then you feel better face with tears of joy
feet I am not the one accusing others of take cheap shots
put no one mentions about cheap shots are you of malaysia child
feet you forgot what you wrote
put am referring to the verbs and not the nouns you know what is sentence structures context
feet so you lied when you said you did not mention it check
put its never a lie but unfortunately you are not thinking creatively and that shallow
feet checkmate
put i am not explaining but lecturing the contorted mind that refused to believe in science
feet that all i have to say
put stop being naive cos lie is in the eye of the beholder
put you can only be done to own self but not to others
feet you can flip your roth pratt like the milf but it does not change the fact that you lied you can choose to be shameless all i have to do is switch off all notifications from you you do not need to bother replying
put are you aware cases rising now in so so what happen to vaccinated travel lane
who recommends against the restrictions out of countries
never been better covid cases can afford to continue to rise we have a lot of spare beds in the ice
him then what happens to herd immunity
how about those sandboxes in thailand and vietnam right now even though these countries allow united states to go there quarantine free singaporeans still need to face a lengthy quarantine upon return can the authority do something for these
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil in
you know what is sandboxes by the way winking face with tongue
a place where one can make sand castles face with hand over mouth face with hand over mouth
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy the two on trial sandboxes now are separate from the main land of thailand and vietnam majority of the islanders had been vaccinated true people from all over the world can enter these islands but only vaccinated people can enter therefore you need to measure the recovery index of these islands separate from the main countries they belonged to if the vision is to be living with endemic now then whats the concern with establishing vaccinated travel lane with these sandboxes where the only potential risk of contacts are with vaccinated travellers from other countries
so naive about this rubbish list
why not thailand and indonesia
indonesia already in
means bantam open liao face with tears of joy
han yes it should be all parts of indonesia are opened
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil
its good news for those who want to travel even for me but i am afraid it will be short lived cases in singapore is still in thousands and they act as if its less than of remember the to spike they place united states in phase two but now cases is thousands they open borders for travel
that is the right thing to bin if wait until zero pax then two thousand and fifty also not fixed
no need until a even less than ten good enough besides no need to wait two thousand and fifty then cases go to a previously singapore also got zero cases low
man well then we would expect to be in lock down forever this virus will not be going away
when that i already know malaysia issue here is the numbers not whether the virus is going away nor not seriously you guys need to wake up
ranking of countries by recovery index why no vaccinated travel lane with thailand phil
man how would you go about doing it how would you suggest to reduce the number without lock down
well you are digressing too far let us start with having the right mindset st i know you guys desperately want to travel so do i but let us address the elephant in the room st which is infected cases is in thousands but vaccinated travel lane is in talks and going to happen does not makes sense right if people cannot see that do not start talking about solutions when the problem itself they cannot identify
I am surprised mysia is lower than so I am expecting them to do worse since they lack good system
mana vaccines does not work look at singapore we know already sin charm according to the rankings by sci have good recovery rate
i assume the gov assess this base on risk they probably think the probability for vaccinated getting infected or die from it are lower compare to vaccinated and considering the total vaccinated citizens in singapore so far its tolerable enough for them to open up without killing the majority people but unfortunate for the minority who could have underlying medical issue or in a poorer health condition top management will want the whole singapore to survive without caring too much on smaller problems if the bigger one can be resolved just malaysia assumption
i i agree with you though i think the only flaws is that govt place too much trust on the efficiency of the vaccines which undermines the reason to take calculated risk for vol but this is another topic to discuss i do not want to digress too far its a mixed feelings for this vol relief and concern
man so much for water buffalo pile of poo efficacy of mana jabs
man well actually thousand of cases a day is not a lot unfortunately take flu for example the current symptoms for of of the folks is similar to that of flu flu has also killed and hospitalized many folks therefore based on your theory thousands of cases is not very significant unfortunately only no i am not desperate to travel let say you are right then how should the case be controlled without vol
not a lot is based on your perspective only compared to a small nation like so thousands is a lot you cannot compare flu to covid in this case flu is not a pandemic that closed down borders and shook the world you asking me about solutions when singapore overpaid ministers cannot solve them rolling on the floor laughing what i can give is suggestions and malaysia point of view stay the vaccines needs to be right st our vaccines is questionable and controversial thus explains why singapore is in this predicament right now get the vaccines right then everything will fall into place and eventually it will be really safe to open borders for everyone
man spanish flu was a pandemic unfortunately of of 6000000 is a very small based on population size and not small if i say three thousand eat chicken rice a day out of six mil that very little right i just want to hear opinion actually because many has claimed to want this fix but not providing a suggestion so just curious how each would manage this would be better to have solution proposal and a vague goal as for vaccine seems like its working to me of mild symptoms that very effective
spanish flu was a pandemic covid is a pandemic so what has what is your point again of of 6000000 is based on your own perspective besides covid is not just in singapore only its worldwide unlike spanish flu as for vaccines do try different sources to know the credibility of the vaccines do not just rely on mainstream media doctors scientists who has no link to govt or media have better credibility to say about vaccines than those who are afraid to lose their jobs try or peter mccullough for instance
you do not die by eating chicken rice
the stone was already cast when tease bought a stake in pfizer
put interesting so you would go for zero covid approach but if all other countries not doing it are we going to not let people in out quarantine forever bios all you need is one case to create a two to four and so on whereas per i thought the same but that requires more than paper and manpower you need the equipment and trained stabbers and testers what if one test is not accurate and how many rounds are required possible but not as easy
put sure but neither is three thousand people dying from covid a day but fact is of of mil is low
and that okay with you
art is less accurate than per why then are we wasting our time and resources i do malaysia own art and is not that every country is rushing to buy per testing equipment if china can do it in a few days for a city of eleven million we should be able to do it no
put if its three thousand more deaths compared to non covid then its no good
put we should avoid characterising people here i do not agree with what gov is doing too china has resources we done where are you going to house six million samples if we do it for five days that is thirty mil samples let me ask you a very simple question if we isolate ourselves we lose investors company leaves singaporean lose jobs of unemployment cannot afford food how
put the point is not chicken rice it is the statistic regardless you may still think its very high that your tolerance
a is high for me but not high enough for you
still cannot connect the dots
put well at this point you are just trying to win an argument i am just point out a fact chicken rice was just used as an example to illustrate point a is very little a will not even get you herd immunity
put of so basically we should be like norway where we just use all the resources we have until it runs out before we figure out what to do bios looks like you are looking at permanent isolation
put i have had a thing is i am not trying to find fault with a singular point of view we can have many suggestions but how to go about doing it is totally another story i can say lock down for one mph let the virus die off will it live in isolation for a month no it won ten pax a now faster the spread faster back to normalcy no need for to no need for all other stuff
man you said flu is not pandemic a of is small go to any statistic calculation and a of is not even considered well within error zone so believing in a a a outspoken source is more credible got it like kim long in or should we look at scientific papers with high citation anyway in terms of vaccine its your own call right
you flip roth pratt as well as the milf a of was low now a one hundred times more is also low now you flip to herd immunity you are too smart for you
joshua is right on the flip roth pratt part rolling on the floor laughing if you are cynical and want to force your confusion to others do it only on yourself you are a laughing stock now and we know it
again the numbers however small is based on your own perspective it seems you are the only one who claimed that of of 6000000 is small so far when everyone else is saying that it is big
in terms of vaccines its not about whether its malaysia call or not I am advising you to be open minded and not have a narrow vision when it comes to information you seems to be one of those people who only read mainstream media try not to get confused
did i say i want permanent isolation did i mention norway stop putting words in malaysia mouth all i want is for the milf to stop their deception and lies opening up to foreigners without quarantine when were not coming because of their travel advisory blacklisting us
and you are the only fool that uses infections per day is population as a measurement on how a country performs how stupid can one get
put you are missing malaysia point not important there is actually no way to keep the case low to achieve reopening you can have low case but once you open up its going to rise again
man actually i am open to the vaccine being unsafe unreliable i am just reading data and using microbiology scientific evident to evaluate the conclusion whereas you are the one who are not willing to accept and i am narrow minded
man go out for a walk see the crowd if majority thinks it just stay inside the four walls
man actually i agree with the pratt flipping part actually if you read back on the chat i just wanted to point out a few facts and looking for suggestions i did not characterized anyone
phratry to read up on how herd immunity work a of is low infection one hundred times more is still not high enough for herd immunity i know you are smart you will understand how microbiology works
man i think we ignore him and just let him make a fool of himself what do you think no point talking to a shameless fool
previously you've said you have no issue with the vaccine now you are saying you are open with the vaccine being unsafe just like joshua said you flip pratt a lot rolling on the floor laughing
what microbiology scientific evidence you mean the one from fact and those who are linked with the profit from vaccines rolling on the floor laughing come on you expect me to believe it is credible
man i think vaccine works was open to vaccine being unsafe do not think its unsafe
majority do not care anymore so much because people like you flip pratt so much and change the rules too often they are outside with the crowd because they want to live normal life again and some like you believe blindly that the vaccines will make you invincible against the virus
put just want to point out a of infection a day is low overall of a a infection is too low for herd immunity even at of also not end
do not forget to agreeing on you yourself doing the flipping pratt too
if they are reliable why you are so lost
hooray good for so thumbs up
a great decision by our mtg they handle it well step by step we are getting there
how can they extend vaccinated travel lane and sacrifice our health well being and lives for money it is a selfish act undemocratic and cruel pouting face outing face outing face
if you are so paranoid then stay at home
if you are that paranoid dig some holes and camp inside till the virus cease to exist but then you have to face dengue too

this is the mandate we gave them during the two thousand and twenty be
thank you for voting them are you sure you are a supporter

sass then why you say that you have given them a mandate its obviously not from you right

ranking of countries by recovery index bloody joke
i agree but also note that the opp parties have been oddly quiet peoples action party or apple is like dem is rep in the us a no real difference until trump or almost bernie rolling on the floor laughing
lima they know why spore must get high vaccination and why we need to open up
how about citizens who return for less than a week does it mean such individuals cannot come home
why must return for less than one week
feet why because not everyone is like you with so much disposable time and no administrative tasks back home
shadow then do not return just stay put and do face timing or virtual meeting from overseas if cannot commit longer
feet who are you to suggest that it is none of your business to try and impose on others are you going to be the one paying for malaysia ongoing bills of expenditure stop being an online nuisance every citizen has their needs and after all this is their home country
shadow then respect the rules and regulations and do not question about how long or short one has to stay cos its your own expenditure to bear and not others
feet you have wild imaginations indeed in malaysia question i was asking about the rule that was not mentioned nor clarified and there is no reason for you to get so excited since when did i not respect the rules i guess you have nothing better to do and enjoy seeking attention this should be malaysia final advise and response to you go do something meaningful and get a life
shadow speak for yourself
feet the difference between a thinking minister and an ignorant and attention seeking you
shadow if you do not know the difference between thinking and mindset flip flopping then can you please keep facing the wall
feet suit yourself of mani padre home bye the pathetic one go face the wall
shadow do not of here and of there just to hide your silly billy first comments about returning home less than a week cos its senseless

please open india too thanks for only injected ones
covid is now endemic is lee sign long prime minister ship also endemic
covid are smarter than what experts think these days i am worried
the vaccine business is making big bucks i bet after the and or third booster shots our government will start to charge united states for subsequent booster shots a new revenue of income from its own citizens
requiring booster shots this early indicates how accurate the is of these mana experiments who is artificially liking these videos the previous videos had higher down vote to up vote ratio this is not organic
they can open up germany to come here direct i just curious why cannot let vaccinated people dine in restaurant for a vaccinated people also healthy right
germany nine bordering countries do you think they will stay in germany twenty one days without leaving the country can we trust they declaration they come to singapore
vaccination below twelve soon no thanks I shall I will pass
from south east to germany from germany to singapore may hooray airplaneairplaneairplaneairplaneairplane
the person who blindly went round to ask if others have read the book he recommended thought that he had read the books he is wiser unfortunately he failed to see that he just stopped there after reading whereas our government has put the gist of those concept to practice however he was blind to see these actions in place that keep the country going probably he needs some tight slaps face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
in malaysia kampong cebu philippines five persons died after vaccine
are we closing in on the search for the correlate of protection especially for the immunocompromised patients before we can recommend the third booster shot and forward that a antibody test for the vaccinated people we are probably too focused on the narrative that is not entirely based on science
the vaccinated ones are the ones with variants
let us count down how long it will take for singapore to go back to phase two heightened alert
so many cases cannot trace still want to open
low that doctor like staged script talking listen liao also sian
only fools like peoples action party ministers believe vaccines can keep the virus at bay
its called self hallucinations
want to play hero
if you allow vaccinated people in please make sure they are all not allowed to dine in as well its double standards if you don't allow singaporean yet allow tourists to dine in
right
putting the feb workers at risk
hello healthy no need wear mask expert will we hear soon
hope the roof earn much more with booster shots
formula for covid of of new variant re not a steeple
if united states starts to jab third vaccines singapore very likely will follow so far this is the model
well the chinese vac must be fake one
amazing grace singapore has an agenda it is not about the corona virus your healthy nor a real vaccine but to coerce everyone here to be jabbed in the experiment teachers put pressure on parents to get teenagers jabbed without even telling them that they are experiment participants
a the press here keep bad mouthing the china vac
no thank you for children

humans never learn
gods judgement and wrath is coming soon matthew twenty four a twenty one
human with common sense do learn but those who lost common sense is like drunkard who are intoxicated similarly supposedly highly qualified people in their respective field maybe overwhelmed by arrogance which they re not aware of is also similar echo pc is a good example
with respect to doctor long which vaccination has he being injected so that it can have a clearer picture of all the top talent doctor and qualify scientist born locally there choose to it need of which brand to it outermost effective protection and prevention of the value in it spirit of it mind to it heart to be known read and see
interesting how silica know if any europe passport has been in germany a days before depart to so mtg mil match
if you do not wish to spread to others
the people here mainly lives in flats and in such close proximity like pigeon holes they also share lifts if they allow active covid cases to stay home during this stage then there's chance of spread because of the proximity also through for mites
actually with the emergence of the delta variant in other countries that are heavily vaccinated should not they slow down the reopening
the govt is prep united states to live with covid as it and restrictions will continue to be revised every now and then
its like playing russian roulette never know when the gun will fire
so are you sure delta is not there in germany and brunei how it differentiate with an indian fully vaccinated traveller please tell me who is at higher side
than please stay home and do not come
us no one knows why border can not be open for vaccinated people they do not have anything to argue
india might be faking their data there could be much more deltas in india which they never declared i think it'll be safer not to let anyone who have been india or any south asia countries in for the past thirty one days
sim who on the earth not faking the data do you know every damn country in the world where virus created havoc has at least one variant however in us a why there is no variant in india now business is as usual india is a open society unlike china media is powerful nothing govt can hide not much covid patients a in hospitals
in malaysia opinion singapore government should require all travellers from overseas including hong kong and macau to also have a negative per are departure test result seventy two hours before getting on a flight to singapore in addition to on arrival test if not some travellers could be covid of positive and actively spreading the virus to others on the plane and in our airport thus endangering the life of fellow passengers staff and others
hope ministers see your comment we do not mind people travelling outta so we a more worried about the incoming ones
a they do not need to see this comments they do not take bus a art seldom they mayan at coffee shop too
a year ago we hoping for a vaccine to end this pandemic now after vaccines come up with delta variant so what variant next echo variant foxtrot variant golf variant hotel variant up until zulu variant then booster booster after booster after booster after booster end up after so many injection then got so many loyang on your arm and covid still smiling and say see each baby I am here to stay bring it on but still I am praying that all will get better i miss malaysia family
it is part of their plan you have been lied to from the beginning all your carbon taxes is a means to siphon more money off the man on the street companies pay a lot of taxes so wages will be depressed and goods will be more expensive as a result of these taxes
they either ignore our comments or act blurred while getting fatter and fatter how no wonder kamala harris wants to shake their hands
can i had peace in malaysia mind here till want senior citizen work seventy age despite people are unable to work permanently anymore in medical ground
plus go to malaysia and thailand or indonesia to stay and tell me if singapore government is corrupted i welcome you to retire there so that the government could subsidize malaysia medical care better

dear ministers tbs i am very sceptical about the vaccines please be honest with united states the numbers and details of people who are affected adversely by the vaccines those that you have issue compensation and is that all now you want our children to be vaccinated as well please review or figures
was the two compensation cases paid they survived covid right
pay out a a million is already admittance to vaccine because of severe illness yeah rite
if they want to tell the truth they will use absolute risk reduction of a a efficacy absolute risk reduction is used for chicken pox and other vaccines

our medical facilities are advanced and adequate to cater to local population but with the re opening starting next month not sure how severe the surge in covid will be with the influx of tourists
low using big words like heterologous and homologous just say mixed vaccine and singular vaccine using flamboyant words show you are not close to the commoners and wants to sync with them still dare to says they are with the people
if you cannot convince confuse face with tears of joy
they are with the people only when things are rosy when the weather becomes stormy they will disappear before you can even blink winking face with tongue
any issue opening the sin malaysia job border
malaysians covid situation is really bod the four countries which we have opened up to have their situation under control
job is at its peak just stay home please
the virus with be very happy
times can any of your reporter ask question to task force about the travel opening with india
nope no thanks a pm infections
please stay home we already he too many cases
allow air travel from many countries but social gathering or dine in at feb still pegged at five pax max i am lost
economy their priority not residents
we too thinking face
kitty profit above people stay safe face with medical mask
a allowing air travel is really risky we kept our cases low within our population and the spike was usually due to influx of tourists even with dining of limited pax do not think gonna help
plus plus open borders to ria esp bantam bin tan singapore should donate vaccine to bantam and bin tan tvs
what about opening of indian border
no please we are still in the mess open borders with india created
nope no thanks a pm infections
just stay home thanks we already have enough cases here
eight comment rubbish
all the virus came from china wuhan just a reminder
one hundred and ninety eight thousand china is a heaven for you why do not you go there you can help them with their flood business
us yes you are right wuhan virus have not been cleared
a your comment is rubbish
a yes but knowing the virus existed and gathering in the thousands is plain irresponsible what has what is even worse is knowing you have a mysterious variant and still have the audacity to travel out of the country and spread the misery everywhere
since our parents judgments and following their leadership we are glad that we have made the right choice as the quality of our lives have been improving continuously sparkling heart Singapore
there is two books you need to read
who moved malaysia cheese
a for we have a former transport minister overnight become health expert so lucky to have genius in govt
quality of our lives are either maintained or still continue to get better in two thousand and twenty and of of hence all of united states have donated the of a received in april two thousand and twenty to charities we must have done something right sparkling heart Singapore
almost all home grown singaporean have the same starting point some ended with very low pay could be due to laziness too
mon was run by electrical engineer a now biz icons major wow
chan plugged into
time to broaden knowledge lou ger steer was co of nabisco biscuit co has no track record in managing computer companies was invited to join ism save the falling computer giant in the of is
cool exited slightly smiling face he you read the books i recommended
the government is still proven to be reliable unlike we have a of misappropriation of funds
also the government is keeping pace with the ever changing world that focus on singular economy
cool exited slightly smiling face your stuck
chan you are blinded
cool exited get yourself better educated instead of spewing pile of poo pile of poo pile of poo
also blind am to case justice has been served party involved was not amp amount involved was not more than of of comparing to workers party pm
corruption right under pms nose thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
only resemblance of has with st gen peoples action party is they are humans where is accountability
switch focus again never worked as or worked for top managements before thought that their only work is making public appearance what is the basis of claiming overpaid
trees well said indeed remember all those a top honchos promise of smart nation digitisation get our seniors to hook onto their bandwagon that their final dream enslavement in progress
chan you always full of yourself comment comment comment and comment full of rubbish
chan do not ask people to read your recommended books i advise you to read history of singapore you are racist i have been reading your comments
pm cannot be responsibly for everyone greed
a rubbish slightly smiling face malaysia comment is not for you plus do not read malaysia comment
a racist which word a sentence make you think so list it out
a reading singapore history is reserved for non true singaporeans do you know why
cool exited blind definitely not me
a pm is overall in charge he is responsible
there are people who thought that they have read some books they are wiser unfortunately they failed to see that our government has put the gist of it to practice they also intentionally turn a blind eye to what the government has been put in to action to keep the country going we on the other hand keep an open mind to assess these actions and make the best out of them
cool exited open eyes rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy i guess you do not even know or eyes a not opened
chan apparently you did not open your eyes pensive face if you want to continue to be sour grapes go ahead will not respond to any further post on this
cool exited he you read the books i recommended
give united states a break with the so called there are reported cases of fully vaccinated dying of covid nineteen in other countries even in singapore there is one case he is irresponsible to say vaccinated are not at risk as i hear him talk it has become jokes
they knew vaccines is not foolproof yet they go into full opening that irresponsible
its called false security
no problem what if ord wave safeguards are already in place action plan
kos face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
triple yup false security
when nov tax soon i hope as option for booster
whether can nov tax can approved for children use in so worry for our children now
kos king once who approves can get it possibly via private hospitals timeline maybe who will approve it six to eight weeks from now maybe less united states cd approval maybe next year jan feb of of
nov tax if effective china will not have a bug out break over more than ten cities which almost of of its people are vaccinated with two jab months ago
wong novara is a united states corp that a protein sub unit vaccine not inactivated killed virus vaccine as of now nobody has approve it for use under eur its under serious consideration for approval by the united states cd its very likely to be approved but very late two thousand and twenty one or very early of of the corporate has not seek any regulatory approval from china pc for use there so do not know what your talking about
in short they do not know what is the ord vaccines its trial and error effectively those taking the booster shot a lab guinea pigs
once jabbed no stopping
amazing grace yup endless pharmaceutical companies revenue is guaranteed
chan exactly
chan one big scam
a nation of vaccine las a probable scenario when a jab is needed every six months very much making everyone a requiring daily medication i really do not know if that is a solution
of of thus their mental calculation is to keep riding on this for as long as they could
chan darla and modern have plants set up here we and the world should ask why are the vaccines free sky said so do not expect freebies have no strings attached especially from the messy will fighting family who ruled united states to eternity who pays whose salaries the covid team is very well fed and very fat indeed during pandemic
I am not a horse vaccine not working keeps jab eth eth ice
three of them he been ard since twenty three jan two thousand and twenty till today without breaks that incompetent
without breaks sounds like they very hardworking face with tears of joy
its the muppet show
do you really need to include the forty sec countdown at the beginning of every video
forsaking peoples lives for money will not be getting malaysia vote ultimately the min will be held fully responsible for all these regardless
singapore should lift every restrictions and lives as per normal do not be fooled by the flu
accountability is apparently one of the roots of the problems and meritocracy must be inherent in the system of leadership which points to the fact that single party mandate is highly suspected to be not working example singaporeans at large are zero tolerance to any leakage of the virus into the communities knowingly unmitigated also leaders should be seen to be correct no excuse accepted example how can the four doctors know better than the medical chief as we recalled mon rebutted the four doctors masking advice
thanks goodness the border measures are now eased aviation is back and singapore is back
on the with aug of year old eth in a month and to make the matters worse mon has the audacity to resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependents with travel history to higher risk countries from ten aug this was announced in the press release by ministry of health on friday evening a aug and law said the virus will leak into the communities from time to time so they knew
i likes the music musical note musical note musical notes to to so awesome thumbs unsmiling face with heart eye red heart

its a comic nineteen booster
heightened alert will be back
whatever it is we all must stay safe
were these reporters actually paid attention to what the ministers were saying especially the last few felt like they were just doing something else instead of listening when the ministers was talking and only turn to their camera when they were called
awesome speeches
check out for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in coming months blood test shows cd dropping drastically
why must there always be a chinese translation only why no malay and tamil translation
because media thinks more chinese singaporean cannot understand english
when will we open up ourselves like our european counterparts those vaccinated employees are denied work at their workplaces the same goes for the self employed not only are they being denied work at their workplaces which some do solely depend on for their living many are also facing restrictions for months if they are to be released from restrictions release them they are not prisoners it is not right to have their livelihoods denied off them when they do not take their jabs many do suffer from depressions and other forms of sicknesses related to being depressed be it mentally or physically plus body aches other than covid of it has been going on for a long time and i do believe it is not a good situation too
what is the daily infection rate in spore from fourteen feb to nineteen feb of of
the tone in his voice does is good news close to of of a is a sign of incompetence expectations
our government cares more for the economy than its people why so how so are the people independent of the economy when the economy collapses its the people who suffer when they lose their jobs go ahead and do a simple search what happens to people in countries where the economy has collapsed a country has so many things to worry about can anyone else who's complaining step up and do a better job taking all things into consideration closing schools sure what happens when kids have to stay at home yes someone will have to stay at home instead of working can parents handle that or are they already pulling their hair a month after watching their kids
i hearsay read from somewhere that someone in that circle had difficulty finding job outside
the symptoms i had were just a normal cough symptoms with sore throat don't worry and its nothing serious at all however the grey area is how people can ensure if they fully recovered from covid since there are many cases where art shows negative but per shows still positive now per to ensure you are fully recovered is more important than per to ensure you test positive
this panel is as useless as the vaccine is
i ask malaysia oversea friends about our situation apparently oversea seems to do something similar it could be just united states catching up with what oversea people are doing were just late in that matter of making this discussion
in the meantime the two thousand and twenty two air show just like two thousand and twenty continues
five seconds into the video and i am already done with them
they are going to make a lot of people into huge problems these is a bunch of blood sucker
from daily eight hundred stable until yesterday twenty four thousand
why nursing home suspended they need family to come its unfair
just close school law the covid and omicron cases increasing more students and teachers getting affected
after nine mind i stop listening and shake malaysia head let united states and see what happen in the next few weeks
please do not try to manipulate people mind
not manipulate if they just read from the script
now fully vac i also easy easy omicron this
omicron is our booster shots hah aha one over they will introduce you the fourth shot and give another name for new strain
thanks that country given so number face with medical mask gone few year
how many deaths per day
all this due to a bowl of bat soup
cup latest invention bio weapon
why only that bat have the virus but not the past or now
not anti vaccination but anti vaccine science and big parma bullshit why do you need medication when you are not sick current science is money making business we are no more patients we became clients and customers to the medical industry
not to ease but simplify whf face with symbols on mouth how long more want to simplify and ease but not normal again
all our minister look exhausted thank you for good job done for singapore and singaporean 我们所有的部长看起来都筋疲力尽了 感谢您为新加坡和新加坡人所做的出色工作
canadian truckers have performed a conclusive scientific experiment conclusion the canadian government is lying face with tears of joy
poke poke but never watch project merits misinformation pretend not to know
canadian truckers have performed a conclusive scientific experiment conclusion the canadian government is lying face with tears of joy
do they know what they are doing
do you know what they are doing
a sitting in a gathering of move than a without much safe distancing without mask
you better buck up ttkoh124 taking your seat liao rolling on the floor laughing
guess from this pandemic we singaporean ought to wake up our govt only caress meet with our current salary many of united states are trying to cope up with the high cost in singapore everyday in the end it is the middle class singapore falling badly all our ministers are getting high salary surely they will not know how we suffer what a lousy govt very sick and tired of their nat
most of malaysia friends are recovered well from home being poor is much scarier than the can virus
no worries can cum singapore govt will make all of united states poor
until the people think that this is all about the virus and the gov is trying to save them this drama will continue the disease inns all about the virus person face palming
clowns just step down la shame lost of control mask wearing so now all clown now show want look nice nice no need put mask no need fine pratt
if the number rises to of of a of the omicron corona virus what will the singapore authority and health science authority will do
blame the vaccinated what else
they may resort to lock down if the situation goes out of control
singapore is truly blessed with the smartest people in leadership anywhere in the world god bless singapore
god bless you when it sneeze
it ore govt is morally upright responsible capable and competent it does not lie blatantly and is trustworthy thumbs up thumbs up
spoken like a truly brainwashed citizen
where is the plan where is the timeline competent no truth
when do your citizen has a choice to vaccinate our kids with sin vac or sin charm
Singapore eco am spray guns disinfectant cleaners
so a little over a third of a percent of the country tested positive in a single day and that in
most that landed in hospital are people fully vac or partially vac I am just wondering how many una person that landed in hospital compare to vac individual
you will never know because they want people to get a coed regardless
dear appreciate statistics why are there so many vaccinated people in hospital you ask there are a lot of people who are vaccinated naturally with this means more people who are vaccinated end up in hospital
clowns
the real pandemic is the mtg
from this pandemic we can see clearly which are communist countries under the sheep skin of democracy and which countries are democratic but under the skin of communism still not sure which countries placed its people over economy and which countries place economy over pal
bunch of a know what
plus relax more hope can be like turkey one day no need are departure after meals which i feel is effective measure they also gave their own repack alcoholic wipe for each customer came back after two was free of infection even though the streets were crowded singing and dancing
i just wish next election peoples action party wins by a clean sweep in all areas
fully vaccinated tested positive after seven days stay home even still tested positive can leave home is this correct
it seems to be what about the vulnerable people like me with heart disease aged and babies are we suppose we suppose to curl up and die
a don't think negatively i avoid crowded places and stay home more still can go park on weekdays
tan thank you dear trying to do so you stay safe too
a its right after seven days still test positive can go out some even never see doctor tested positive also go around spreading that's why today figure keep going out so try not to go out especially hawker centre market shopping mall crowded place public transport stay home keep save rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
no for how long we going to just stay home
of well done just follow
yrs sam restrictions after a get whole life
yeah all rules lax already after that get a
wow what a great forecast and preventive measures with reliable risk assessment well done
why is per test so expensive in singapore as compared to other countries around the world honest question
because rental and profit margins are high honest answer face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
your wallet their wallet keep in it real
aliyah not expensive la win win solution law
expensive of a is pm of a are you doing currency exchange
put via sing of a is expensive its only pm one hundred and fifty in malaysia
ching global covid university small price difference i can understand but its almost three times more compared to many other countries
it compare pineapple with apple rms of is expensive for local
put via and you think of a is not expensive for local singaporeans money is money regardless of where you are from the effectiveness of a per test in malaysia is still the same as in singapore so why such a big price difference seems like you are the one comparing pineapples and apples and who cares what brand we use all we want is whether its positive or negative
you do not need to keep doing the per to get double confirmation most people depend on art tests and rest at home if they show symptoms
cannot afford do not come here you are not a locust right
put via got negative on art multiple time despite having positive on porn or here saying why people don't trust art
high rental of bow cost of living in singapore is no one in asia last year do you know how yeah profit margins are high so rich man go richer and we forever slave
a come where born and bred in singapore i am asking about price difference not about whether i can afford or not
ching global covid university you not tease for sure its not a living being
beaming face with smiling eyes
in warning to us covid rates soar after denmark lifts all restrictions ref yahoo denmark became the first major nation to lift the last of its pandemic restrictions but since its number of cases and deaths have skyrocketed
did you check covid numbers of denmark or follow mem read and repeat if not yet check denmark covid cases on your own and the fact now is no more covid rules and restriction on the st feb of of a new cases weekly average of of a on the with feb of of a new cases and weekly average of of a cases
a what has what is your point
record high of of of a new covid cases in a
these days trust cannot be simply granted
in of of i lost all trust in them what else
these days when peoples action party says i want to laugh
in another words children and elderly are relegated to another make shift facilities other than the proper hospital care please respect our elderly better
so if social distancing then don't need mask a
singaporean are more sick of the measures than the virus let us ease all measures and lives our life as per normal
yes sick and tired of this measures milf should change mindset its endemic just move on and remove all restrictions
already very high number of cases bring back zero covid of policy actions now not sleep again and let cases shoot up
means don't need to take booster shot anymore a who good
kenneth may already said there is no concrete plan for eth dosage anyway we have procured the covid treatment pill that should be enough barring a new variant
a turn will come soon
one also haven't taken rolling on the floor laughing
the plan is five
will have new variant no worry
iron not just new variant but new viral species its natural biology to have pandemics just like there will always be diseases isn't that true
hopefully new zealand will be added soon these are beautiful vast countries for travelling
how come not showing the number of vaccinated death anymore what is mon hiding
gotta thank peoples action party for making the country a super spreader
still cannot go a for holiday loudly crying face
positivity is more than a now
number to hit ten thousand
more cases above five thousand and many more deaths and we are talking opening borders like nobody business
so big deal the number of deaths from covid in singapore backyard is something more even bigger deal to deal with
so rush to open should have at least wait for everyone to take up ord shot first then see how
many people worldwide are protesting hard against vaccine mandates a vaccine passports many doctors nurses firefighters police military soldiers teachers etc are striking and walking out of their jobs to protest the jab or job vaccine mandates
where are all the folks gone before the new restrictions limiting dine in to only vaccinated customers in coffee shops there was a good number of customers at these places even with the two to a table limit but now if you care to notice most coffee shops have a sparse look while is can be seen for take away the same thing at the fast food outlets the take away and delivery people far outnumber the dine in folks this is odd since of of the population are vaccinated and should have no problem as dine in customers why did the crowd thin out so abruptly
because the version rated know they are the speedy silent super spreaders no to vex sin
amazing grace another explanation could be that the vaccinated percentage could be lower than stated
maybe the high vaccinated numbers just a smoke screen
welcome welcome everyone spent your money here
yes spend your for covid treatment here
twenty one
utah only if singapore had covid under control low
the baby zebra looks so adorable beautiful smiling face with smiling eye purple heart cherry blossom
the problem of this singapore only is in their mind now mon complain that ice beds are reaching critical levels a straining the medical facilities a workers even without opening up so how a you going to manage if the tourist is infected after finishing their quarantine here
the only problem may be do australians want to travel to high risk country
i do not think most australians will choose to do so
in australia is like her own continent with so much natural beauty to enjoy that most of them will hardly need to travel elsewhere leg to see blocks of pigeon holes
only government
yes i have been travelling in australia where is the scenery is very beautiful the quality of life of local residents is also very high
belgian minister just announced the fourth wave says the hospitalization numbers are not good of of population are vaccinated

very proud of our forward looking govt we must stay open and make more it this will protect spores livelihoods
yes open more hospitals and mortuaries to match more vaccinated travel lane openings
a we have pessimistic and fearful people anxious face with sweat
better than reckless and brainless toads
yes very proud but wait our own people cannot go out in threes at home we do not even want to protect our own livelihoods and businesses but we dying to help neighbouring countries show we are willing to send our people there to boost their economies way and kings
thank god for good govt for free fast vaccines after malaysia he fifty seven yrs he three highs lever issue just discharge one week from heart hospitalised but with vaccine home recovery from covid now i am more relaxing at least he alive relaxing new normal life looking forward when travel overseas malaysia and into red heart Singapore
best wishes to you and your he take care
should ask indonesia government instead
go ahead singapore lion
petrol prices increase vaccinated travel lane for businesses
singaporean now need to get ord jab as fully vaccines do we implement this to oversea travellers or only apply to singaporean do enlighten us
yes very good question
looks like you have to regularly update your vets nation status no to vex sin
you will need to keep taking or dosage of vaccine if not or vaccine status will expire do not become a and class citizen just obey and follow the rule
great the world become citizens of vaccines united nation of vaccine
testing positive in overseas will be problematic and very costly travellers need to be well prepared with and risks
you take care of yourself first done be kapok
i think got travel insurance for covid now
ooh let us hope its fully covered not those that say fully covered but later find out so many hidden cost not covered
finally some common sense from the singapore government
is report no of of of long covid management principles version of july a of of we would like to hear from the govt their responsibilities and preparedness of special measures and medical funding for singaporeans and dedicated diagnostic and care programs for these long suffering patients
apparently they donate funds away only seen to be helping to boosting himself then to answer and face the pertinent question above
fourteen more cases up lorries while one hundred and seven are unstable in ice and of of a are in or new peak essential
all human facing deaths just matter of times fight to be alive or bye bye folded hands
two hundred deaths this mph oct alone sex of of of thumbs up clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
still very small in their eyes need to add at least one or two more zeros behind put under other categories
the danger of the vaccinated travel lane lane doing away with quarantine it takes time for corona virus to become established in the body so a negative test doesn't necessarily mean you wont test positive later on five july two thousand and twenty one by linda geodes
keep making noise very time you make noise two more countries added
plus four variants tagged to it too
wong why are you fearing
twenty one
vol lane is to enrich the rich and the enterprise and their cronies businesses while the majority faces more potential risks
vol lane is without scientific support example per test needs time to be accurate no scientific evidence to do away with quarantine except for gain
vol with china
it will be very soon
should its cases are very low now
truly truly let us hope it can be done soon
they are the real money tourists
china has done a perfect job in controlling the virus
truly truly true they can spend money better than most tourists
in china expects new covid outbreak to worsen in coming days it has spread to eleven provinces
not deteriorate because the chinese accepts restrictions will not resist rolling on the floor laughing
in do you think its lives to this extreme extent
no i think its sad not to be free
in its good to be free
do you have we chat
all i can tell people is this just don stupidity become malaysia problem
singaporeans should not fear covid they should fear the ministry task force
if there was a contraceptive vaccine yes people it really is that stupid
jesus is coming back to the earth to resolve everything as prophesied in the bible last chapter revelation
were not even reporting on the virus anymore were just reporting on the milf and second guessing their flip flops liaise liaise liaise
now vaccinated travel lane has became virus travel lane org
this is what you call living with covid shut everything again when a new weaker variant is found lao
stop vaccinated travel lane air not land most viruses came thru airport first why so guide
instead of having incoming travellers stay at home wouldn't it make more sense to have them isolated away from home first in hotels for the incubation period in case they infect the people at home with omicron this was the protocol before
now then suspend vol dons too late virus already come in why always wait until the virus come in then government act only suspend vaccinated travel lane with malaysia or the europe countries too
rigidity or stu
thank you i finding still hiding in beijing for past two years watching pal die around the world the biggest terrorist the world has seen after hitler yet people are quiet no sanctions yet
it is clear that omicron is already in our community the three anytime fitness omicron cases had not travelled abroad nor were they close contacts of the confirmed omicron cases imported and community the key consideration therefore is not the detected cases so far but rather the undetected cases which we know are already present yes the freeze on vols are long overdue given the escalating omicron situation in many of our vaccinated travel lane partner countries but still better late than never
purple heart purple heart purple heart purple heart purple heart
those already purchased vaccinated travel lane tickets should get fourteen days quarantine when they return back this is a loophole
it is no big deal i do not think the statement saying that everyone will catch covid is correct either you choose to take risk you choose covid or covid choose you despite of precautions taken and still catch it it is inevitable
i will volunteer to look after the stewardess
israel prepares for eth jab to combat omicron spread
if we followed north korea close the borders since day one we wouldn't end up like that anyway so much resources wasted sporrans expected to be blamed again
good move hope no increase of cases due to omicron
well done our transport minister stop all incoming flight temp wait and see for two weeks
two years more realistic
opening up of borders when a relatively new virus is at an onset stage is the stupidest and very wrong thing to do the authorities are putting the health of not just flight and ground crews at risk but unnecessary stress on medical staff who are seriously in need of their long overdue breaks after working overtime during the recent mass exodus and fighting hard to save patients lives run the country with a heart and not just brains with economic growth in mind
screw the elderly save the economy for future generation instead
zero org what happened to humanity the elderly could be your parents or grandparents too
it try to keep things somewhat functional
ferrari driver charles lectern was infected twice this year of of with the covid virus in january december in a high profile sports like formula one racing drivers and pit crews are vaccinated so with three jabs of man made vaccines and two covid infections it does not seem to afford any protection
bad thing for change airport and airlines pensive face disappointed face
too late
two weeks too late milf squandered the opportunity to delay community outbreak of omicron see you five thousand
you need evidence in everything right now you have your evidence in an economically painful way
very smart move clap clap clapping hands
stop incoming flights before singapore will suffer because of imported omicron virus to safeguard singaporeans
omicron infectious rate is at least four times more than a variant as usual we are screwed again
i thought we supposed to open up and live with covid face with hand over mouth
a bought their story
yes and with what we have seen from the beginning of this pandemic it was always going to be a few steps forward and occasionally a step or twi back the benefit of hindsight will bring forth many who like to show proof that their bet was a winner after an issue had passed but their overall winning odds are not much different from all those who were wrong on that particular bet
all seeing eye talk is cheap action please we need all patriots to quickly take the boosters and your kids and grand kids too so that you can take the eth shot asap so or all seeing have you done your part
lots of omicron infected have entered singapore we are screwed again by incompetent leaders
face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy pratt flipping time incompetent in charge expect more
now you say flip pratt if no action taken you say they value money over lives
as i said so much earlier it is not the time to open up so many imported cases of imported omicron causing lea
causing leakage into community see what happens now got cluster of community omicron
the flip flop never end in the farmland
poor leadership
hah aha coming soon eth booster on the way for adults rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughingsyringesyringesyringesyringe this is definitely some kind of experiment already
noway I shall I will be someone
large i cant even use the word de population face screaming in fear
wait for it soon they will make it like an insulin shot take weekly a
singh al nah that wont happen
open close open close really singapore locking with other country
phase two
should act sooner as most of the omicron cases are imported now the omicron already in singapore causing our citizen fear and anxiety
they overlooked those travelling vaccinated travel lane via buses expressionless face expressionless face expressionless face
which one decide mon or mot what about mon health workers are worried
those who rushed for a vacation purposes plus don't cry to come back wait patiently
wow many people went to see family whom they had not be so insensitive
sandoval please read what i type vacation purposes hello i've thought through before commenting there are various reasons for people travelling and again for your sake i have stated vacation purposes if you don't understand the meaning of the above please reply to me and please keep your sensitivity to yourself and read carefully thank you
do not sour law you can stay in singapore whole life every after covid in two thousand and thirty
expected one
burst many time liao
I am beginning to think we a paying millions to a bunch of clowns
clowning is as clown does good observation indeed perhaps the next round in the making some wise men are in charge
should be paying hundreds instead of millions
no one can predict omicron or manic on
that ore govt
however not responsible when they rush to open
laggard action by the highest paying ministers in the world singapore will be in the doldrums in the hands of the incompetents
as usual another lie
so how whf still on both
fat hope they want you to work in office till a then happy pay peanuts but want your soul
up yeah for later community omicron rises then ask all to whf
a yeah lord always reactive measures than proactive measures
buy a bit more time saying the same lame is line as an excuse for two years
although it came a little late but still better than doing nothing let us hope this helps to buy time with omicron the whole game rule changes
imagine trying to catch air
some things just cannot be rush
any until now than stop selling vaccinated travel lane ticket is of people ken see and learn from other country la
you have better idea that can balance the needs of everyone do not be a joke yourself
close complain do not close also complain inn you think you have better idea
like playing accordion music
simply because vaccines do not work against transmission of virus not against delta and definitely not against omicron still pushing boosters are they out of their mind
please add philippines to green list
明知山有虎 偏向虎山行 of translate mtg knows the dangerous omicron variant is spreading fast and potentially can evade immunity and render vaccine useless and yet still opening up more vol i dun know what to say then when omicron reaches here and hits the economy and kills singaporeans they will blame singaporeans for not following safety measures and causing omicron to spread
similar to opening up a cage and letting poison snakes bite you
five hundred a more infectious no problem just need five hundred booster shots for error ruler of the planet omicron perseid
plus also be much more vigilant with us they have a lot of travellers with south africa as i hear from german scientists the thing they call omicron now is super aggressive
deadly africa variant probably have reach so singapore is opening up like there is no tomorrow will know in two weeks time
no opening no tomorrow hong kong closed very tight but they came too
hong kong two cases by far singapore with its liberal opening will see sex or even of of of hong kong cases
if hong kong is your model country then you must be very sad now what does it teach us no matter how closed you are the virus can find their way in the defense should be vaccination
foolish comments toss
we are hoping you go on frontline for united states since you are so patriot plus others who hang on to your words
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
with so many it is launched omicron like the delta will most likely be imported by air
in fact without super easy global mass travel the entire pandemic would have been far not as bad i suspect that these times are over get used to it change airport better have a different plan
i am sure the new african variant is impossible to enter singapore via vaccinated travel lane countries looking forward to xmas surprises
new south africa variant on the way
heard of this before when china started the covid and when a turn to penetrate
to study medicine and scientist and how much do we need to pay
a very responsible and capable spore govt bravo
they are looking for volunteers you can join them with your superior supervisory skills you can take united states out of this pandemic we are counting on you slightly smiling face
yes let united states wait for first to take united states out of this pandemic before you say bravo unless we see death rates down to zero you can clap slightly smiling face
i give up figuring out how these idiots think with twenty seven vols multiply that by twenty seven and our reputation as a tourist hub is destroyed
they detected the south african guy during quarantine vols no quarantine see how dangerous that is so how the hell are we to know if the a variant has arrived in our shores
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
hong kong closed like hell still came rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
somebody making a fool of himself using emo is no original idea just riding on malaysia coattails ill just ignore him
that because they are waiting for you to visit he sure get via welcome
only fools like you believes omicron has not reached our shores it may already be hiding in your closet
a so let it be get vaccinated and protect yourself
better rush for vaccinated travel lane and travel while you can once a variant arrive cd time show liao for delta is now so old news of of two thousand and twenty two will be this new variant
wuhan virus is still fresh in malaysia mind
lets of up the world
by going chinatown
who said
only one face with tears of joy face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing if it is highly contagious one can spread to several tens or hundreds if hong kong has it more already got it
who said
when i circulate malaysia banana it also mutate to monster banana
typical fire fighters tactic incompetents are waiting for singapore to caught fire before they decide to take action till than whole country is on fire that too late
rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy africa variant does not deter incompetents only when it arrives and spread beyond control then they will take action till then its too late
who said
well said lets watch the mtg scrambles when the a strains reach our shore
when that happens they just reduce the number of dine in pax from five to two and then zero we see that pattern how many times already that why i keep saying they must keep the vaccinated bogeyman story going otherwise nobody else to blame but themselves
the whiners are camping here rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
does anyone know why the same idiot keeps appearing and making a fool of himself he has nothing to offer just the same old worn out word with a few emo is scattered around nothing but riding on our coattails quite shameless actually
says the wuhan virus
why are you here then if not to bark are you here to crow
africa be careful new viruses face screaming in fear face screaming interface screaming in fear
you mean war between united states and china its mad
no she meant wuhan virus made her mad
ply open pakistan ply
walking straight into oncoming trouble
what about travellers from south africa or europe to those extended vaccinated travel lane countries
what about wuhan virus
tiny island forgot how tiny she is
time to do hollywood dance at airports
very scared now it will come here i am sure
yes we volunteer first to represent singapore our version of brave heart
new variant from a a has thirty mutations fears of vaccine evasion cases detected in a botswana and in a passenger who arrived in hong kong from a a
the notice still say residents including maybe extending to all the fully vaccinated dorms workers to show their sincerity since face to face lessons for primary schools had resumed since october
so let total infected children is of of a numbers
the safest is safety by avoidance but only practice by them for example no face to face map session while gates are opened for enterprise businesses
one hundred and twenty seven types good paying jobs are sacrificed away of in deep shock
so the question is what is the purpose of living as a singaporeans for you with you if you will have to accept daily can deaths and thousands community infection for it is not a solution the question is when will it reach you or our family members
can what the has in deep shock
one hundred and twenty seven types good paying jobs are sacrificed away of in deep shock
squid game next better talents please
no scientific merits and no positive results to do away with quarantine its simply illogical in the context of citizens life safeties single party is unwise and dangerous
these days trust will not be granted easily for the basis were eroded voters deserve to be respected with the truths and not cherry picked data to benefit their narratives
who said
journalist kos you fences speech pattern is fast fast normal fast fast normal fast fast fast its hard to follow or catch everything he said
testing the limit
living with the virus is wrong it is a breeding ground for mutants who said
test of the resilient grinning face with sweat
yes must be yours which is more superior to the rest of united states
xxx to all to
new multi mutation variant new restrictions have been placed on travellers from several african countries by the ministry of health mon amid reports of a potentially more contagious variant of the covid of virus circulating in that region
complete waste of time money no benefits to both bantam and singaporeans except the hotel resort go there just to stay at resort might as well stay at home passed will only go when both countries open up their borders
because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment now is the best time to invest and make money hundred points
cry to is the new gold
stocks are good but cry to is better

no need quarantine for covid but come back with sex disease
waste of time and money confine to one area
grimacing face grimacing face outing face angry face with horns goblin
what about bin tan
two years back tun gnu buna menu be as quarantine be as demand a thumbs up
singapore should be banned from the banking system removing singapore from the swift system would give singapore an incentive to stop racism
forty five quintillion six hundred and forty one quadrillion five hundred and sixty trillion four hundred and fifty six billion four hundred and five million six hundred and forty thousand five hundred and sixty three singapore is not an international player micro managing lives of citizen is an crime
hew yeah thanks for that really relevant contribution
nah is just transferring yourself from a jail to a nicer jail cannot go to eat malaysia seafood and go to harbour bay as long as cannot go to harbour bay it is waste of time
you are paying to be treated like prisoner what crime did you commit to deserve this type of treatment
what so special about it when to enter the ferry terminal you already need to be vaccinated is not everyone in the area vaccinated
one must be crazy to travel to bantam now when so many better freer safer more developed countries let you in without an art result or tracing app
let me get this straight travellers can go to bantam but only confined to songs resort area and never get to go to main attractions like nazi padang restaurants cheap cinemas malls seafood restaurants by the sea wet markets delicious street foods turtle eggs to etc even those who have families or friends there will not get to see them because the locals outside songs area and singaporeans cannot mingle so what has what is the hype about singaporeans able to meet families and friends again
i think you can visit other places and stay at other hotels but there going to be quarantine
true they should allow singaporeans to visit the entire island and not just the confined areas
why are we so pleased in promoting medical apartheid anyone still sleeping
there is no reason to visit another gulag from our very own gulag
can not visit bantam to no use also uncles will get bored
its like holiday prison
correct bro a holiday resort alias prison vacation
no points going there but isolate in resort
exactly
not worth it at all no point having this travel bible or vaccinated travel lane because i as a singaporean still could not visit or see malaysia family members in bantam or they malaysia family members are barred from coming to the resort place where we are staying so what good is that having travel build or it thumbs down thumbs down face with steam from nose face with steam from nose hear no evil monkey hear no evil monkey
no more geelong now i go to bantam low
is us
hope can visit bantam soon beautiful adventure and looking forward

ceca virus of
so can peoples action party govt finally keep the tourists under fourteen days quarantine now we know its safety
merck pharmaceuticals has been approved for in the united states my
need those foreign labours
i think the government is making a very deadly decision which it will regret later this new virus will surely be transmitted via this way
johannesburg has six direct flights a day with mumbai see you five thousand
government who care less for safety of singaporeans
one second ago well when we get the new variant and become worst again then these people starts pointing fingers at each other in the mean time money are more important pile of poo
suicidal decision fatal act singapore is doomed we will soon be famous again for the wrong reason

to prepare for all the vols we need patriots from the a and grassroots to come forth and lead the battle please go for your boosters and send your kids in for the trials bring your frees and family the country needs them wear your badge proudly
let welcome omicron already two case soon more
virus variants queuing up for their turn whenever necessary
valve sin trade off lie
pap has lost their mind vol with indonesia and india at this time is madness especially when countries like israel japan and morocco are banning foreign travellers
india more nearer to africa and indians are almost everywhere in seven continents of the world so the chances of them carrying the virus is greater than indonesia and the current indonesian govt support peace and progress in south east asia than their previous predecessor imagine if no covid but indonesia not happy with spore also does not work well for united states and our economy or is it we use to this kind of peace that we take it for granted
they always do what is right in their own eyes
eyes sorry human you had to use van
amazing grace human economy is going down no doubt about it
why seniors are dying daily
those who has watched their news and documentaries then and now we know india is potentially a high risk country to get infected with new virus easily wonder how accurate their infected cases are confused face
great more to come a responsible and capable spore govt
of no i think this will end up well
doom day is on the way
of all countries why them twelve thirty is ticking for new virus coming in smiling face
maybe because their positivity rate is lower than yours
bane rhee really pal living in toxic air polluted land has a lower positive rate smiling face
part that's the best you got come back later buddy
part bow in case you don't know yes lower positivity rate
bane rhee that what you think at rural area undeclared whole world knows it face with tears of joy
bane rhee cannot accept reality give genuine facts when you he one buddy face with tears of joy
part i think you know something more than everyone knows also you seem to have a strong personal bias which is why you quipped with things like polluted land toxic air totally unrelated to discussion point the fact is that singapore had a higher positivity rate with very large clusters in a few places the fact is out there to be seen also adding a smiley at the end of a comment does not make things funny just shows the lack of ability to have a civil discussion
banner debian really you pal are not am not funny but amuse me and probably others with unrealistic medical logic hope this is a civilize discussion for a see no smiley
who asked for this face vomiting
i kingpin hiding still in beijing why why covid kingpin no come out these days
yeah and no one asked your govt to invest in our country either go beg for your cps monies elsewhere
they have parked a lot of us in singapore so must let them in law
sorry human you better stay in human country now not welcome outside much very soon

Nothing wrong with changing tactics Why be a dead duck
So stupid to think it can reopen borders unilaterally without keeping local infection numbers low eVery other country will be looking at sGt overconfidence arrogance and complacency has backfired and undone all the hard work and effort to keep So safe and almost free from covid lIving with cOVID is wrong messaging by the So govt rAther it should be to continue to adapt to living cautiously with a dangerous virus

I think MTG strain is much worse than the delta strain
You are correct You watch their press conferences Then you watch the strain on their faces as they answer the questions Like suffering from constipation So yes The MTG strain is worse than Delta
For your report on Nov of does it mean that except for one person the rest of the thirteen who died are vaccinated skull and crossbones worried face
You are correct The last few days reports did not worry until we reach two million deaths
In corporate reporting if you do not present comparison of figures in a uniform manner you be fired
at this point in time you still believe whatever they report low always take it with A MOUTHFUL of salt
Correct me if i Understand wrong is not this Denmark is saying to Singaporeans you fly kate with your double vaccines you still cannot enter means vaccine or No vaccine is same
Yep its becoming clearer people no longer believe vaccinated individuals are safe and do not pose dangers to others
how are you going to pass thru change airport without tax its the same whatever Denmark is strangely india and taiwan tax rate only less twenty no longer breaking news or co i do

First I am framing these questions Was are you referring to
First So you ran away from an earlier thread suffering such humiliation only to come her to continue making a fool of yourself
I understand if your European and want to bali kampong but if you Singaporean go there holidays for what backside so itchy stay Singapore longer a bit so difficult meh
I also do not understand Singaporeans get locked in all those housing flats all their lives but never feel lacking freedom but Covid lock down was too much for them once the border was opened they had to go holiday
Had SO Games ordered snap fourteen days lock down in early last month it all could be long over by today and case would drop drastically but what they did just announced stupid dine in restrictions now eur is imposing restrictions on us whose faults
Earlier lock owns also no use when they did re afraid of the numbers and too lazy to do the work required to stop the spread wAy and only in the meantime they bought a sTake in pfizer now at of all you hear from them is vaccination vaccination on hindsight we know the Plan was hatched much earlier than we were told

Why go EUr Who go there
king long You will be stunt when travelling EUR is a necessity like drinking water for quite a handful of people
How dare they insinuate that Singapore is going through a Pandemic Of The Vaccinated
Why like that We are number one if not number two in vaccination rate in the ENTIRE WORLD leT Even otters are vaccinated five times each and they are still green and alive
SO was the toast of the world with few Covid deaths and daily cases The world would love to crowd into our super safe island nation But it was closed sO so Ministers decided to open up and reconnect with the world Even if it means sacrificing our people come But now the admiring world is beginning to shun us The US a couple weeks ago already re classifies Singapore in the High Travel Risk category nOw eUR is doing something similar oF no
Then do not come for Why scare

Old Lee Hope you consider to get vaccination soon
Amp cos Germany a year old died two days after taking
Amp cos Germany stopped for children currently
Countries in europe are experiencing a surge right now Denmark has thousands of cases every day
This is like a person being ostracized for unhygienic behaviour like not showering for weeks go around town and yell at every passersby that they've not showered either
The Whole World is going through a Tough Time owing to Covid Wuhan Virus Pandemic from China causing Untold Sufferings and Unnecessary Deaths Globally especially in Singapore Sad Scenarios Indeed
SO should remove Denmark from VOL as well
Sidney Lock Hah aha Singapore will never dare to do that clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands

Saw wINg By External force i mean any kind of events outside the control of siNgapore government likE they can make thousands and one kind of vol but the Denmark gov just cancelled whatever Spore status within EUr listing Vaccination from Singapore becoming totally irrelevant from the Denmark gov point of view sUch action is tremendously encouraging to all untaxed people like us
There is a difference No vaccination means high risks or even death Think carefully
Malaya Hartman Like New Zealand people protest clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands

Self humiliation at its best Give people also do not want clearly illustrated here Well done MTG
The situation will definitely get better and the VOL will resume as per normal The spore govt has no lack of capability to do that
But Heaven have other plans for Them The last two years have taught you that one aspect of Life We always end up holding the bag in all their heist
Its the delta virus that had more capability than singapore gov
John five thousand eight hundred and sixty four Nice thumbs up
No worries You close doors to united states its of We will still open doors to you all We are a friendly country Welcome to Singapore
SO data is fine especially versus EUr SO policy making is bewildering and untethered to data so what are global partners meant to think
Singapore is heading for big trouble
EUR tourist are probably not coming to Asia for year end holidays
Big trouble No law So who are more worried You know I know
EUR tourists love Singapore They are not that scared like us
If I were the EUR I would have done the exact same thing Seeing as how our dear government have fucked up our country because of their inability to govern properly I would be done
Apparently tax unix are not safe anymore please be more transparent as to how many who left united states are tax or unix simple request
They are good but average deaths per million of EUR is one thousand per million while our poor govt made it of million Appreciation is very rare these days

Good analogy Can hide from its own citizens using Big Data technology judiciary system etc No where to hide if its beyond their boundary
That's a nice analogy a yamaha
We should let people know that no country in this world is testing like us Big number is expected when almost everyone not working from home need to be tested at least once a week oUr death rate nicE Cases is not as good compare to our own record but still one of the best in the world
One of the best in the world Where did you get that from Just look at our daily cases and deaths per of of compared to other countries Even Bangladesh and India are doing much better than united states now
China testing is so much worst than we are When a single case is detected the entire province is primed for lock down
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
End India is doing much better bios they re not reporting the real numbers Calm to tits
it is a different strategy With our current strategy we cannot copy China formula because we shall be testing whole country everyday
Hah aha talking like clown face clown face clown face now every country is so scare of Singapore Singapore how

John five thousand eight hundred and sixty four Yeah I guess our performance is really bad
king long yOu are changed the topic It was just an example But since we have moved onto the topic of elections My personal belief is that PAP should not have super majority again wE needs to speak up and not turn into PAP A which it looks like they are turning into The other smaller teams need to work together pOP is doing a good job sEP pm AND BRAD BOWYER NEED TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT THEY HAVe a bIgger party as that is much better than many small parties unfortunately since priam became low i think some agreement was put in place to give him that position which basically turned we into papas a team

Two clowns spotted
So what has what is proven to be leaky ineffective over time and harmful
Now denmark need singaporean to quarantine
The rest of EUR nations will follow suite
Who go there FOR WHAT
No big issue It will be changed soon
Safe and Effective
Although Singapore has done really well on many fronts during this pandemic they've clearly faltered in many areas including not establishing a VOL with countries like India where cases per of of is way below singapore and instead opening its borders with vol for countries like us and us where the numbers continue to remain ridiculously high putting economic interests first and with absolutely no regard or respect to migrant lives in the process Hope Singapore does not pay a high price for such really bad decisions after decades of hard work which has contributed to its growth tHe world is watching sIngapore closely
no test no case Other country cases is low so you think they are safe no that is because they do not test their people low
Done well in many Front Just don't comment without thinking
Very talkative rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
do not worry Singapore has many Complain Kings who will blame after something bad happens not before
Now our Covid numbers are so high even EUR is scared Well done on your theory of Living with Covid MTG
take a sit mate low everyone is living with it We cannot live the zero tolerance policy like china Not like Singapore is banned forever gesso
Unless it gets high enough it will never get lower and we will be stuck in permanent circuit breaker and closed border bEtter to let the cases rise Countries which close border to Singaporeans now will open eventually anyway like Singapore itself opened to India uS etc
of plus cases eight did not make it New Normal
Us death per million is of of million people A sea of useless whiners
Livelihoods matter Ever wonder how eighteen million people are living below poverty line in modern US A the greatest country on earth Here you pub every day against the govt Open your eyes and see
Expected
For opening of granting free land vOL with Malaysia I would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity All public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings fOr every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated tHat way safe distancing can be maintained Should also consider allowing Private Hire Cars registered only in JOb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
This is Gold zany face flushed face face with monocle face with rolling eye woozy face food for thought thinking face If you are open minded enough to take these words in have a think about it tHis was posted to the nO pRime mInisters page pOsted on hacienda orders consent that one alone blows me away finally after all the vaccines Jab shots i listeD above i have never seen a vaccine like this one that discriminates divides and judges a society so much information is censored deleted and removed from the internet and mainstream media so many doctors health care professionals police and scientists are censored and forbidden to Speak out or ask legitimate questions when what is being Allowed or not allowed does not make sense particularly when it comes from mainstream media i havE never known a vaccine that has made all the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture it exeMpt from liability if it kills everyone to a point where no life insurance will cover it this is one powerful vaccine guys it does all these things above that i have mentioned and yet it does not do the one thing it is supposed to do which is fight off this pandemic person shrugging light skin tone female sign
This is absolutely ridiculous Vaccinated residents cannot re enter but travellers can
Local cases are high when compare to the import cases sO it indicates that disease is getting spread not only just because of people who travel from other country When people are vaccinated why cans disappointing and painful that discrimination among countries regarding the border reopening Government has to take some initiative to open the border by implementing some safe travel plan
I cans opinion on this topic on YouTube but I can find Chinese propaganda
All it takes is for Indonesia to open a low tax haven in Bantam Bin tan and attract funds and investment Laws can always be enacted to provide the comfort required by investors
What about India
Very lousy all step down thumbs down
Imagine hiring an actual epidemiologist to plan a countermeasure against covid PUff that that clearly not a good idea
Ike Ministers who do not even have a public health background doing public health
This covid just would disappear Just open What to do downcast face with sweat

Prescribed in erection for early treatment you can go back to Prev days
Can I go to Malaysia by road Are the borders open
So sad to confine dormitory workers in their dorms for long singapore they are humans too Not toys
On Be King is right Businessmen and businesswomen must be able to travel freely out of Singapore without the penalty of a two week hotel quarantine
Or Zambia everyone knows who he is IS the correct person and MOST MEDICALLY QUALIFIED RECOGNISED WORLD WIDE to lead the MILF REGARDLESS of which party one is in its lives at stake
Somehow listening to them does not seem to inspire confidence
Big parma can NOT be trusted see the latest
please put All thirteen Cabinet members photos re arrange these for new info up in Youtube please As you must reach a consensus
Actually we cant even open all doors of our shopping centre Let alone overseas I understand there is an urgency to restore air travel but its just so hard I believe there is some sabotaging involved
Can I go to Malaysia by road Are the borders open
The so call expert maybe still learning about delta The problem is they try too hard to convince united states they know everything and may sugar coat the information a bit too much bUt sabotaging should not be the case whY saba ourself wHo want gene blanket party by doing that
Eric Put I am supporting the government They are trying their best to restore things to normal I just suspect someone is sabotaging
Some how if there was some form of consequences for this level of absurdity i don't think they will continue to perform like this way They seemed unaffected with people dying due to their incompetency
Because their irresponsible action is not accountable for
Nothing absurd here Everything done is a considered decision based on what is known Lots of unknown too Instead of throwing stones which does not help anyone time you chip in like the rest and unite behind the team
brother chop so to consider this pandemic to be an endemic falls under which category known or unknown
brother chop incompetency is incompetency even if provided with all the knowledge available on covid an idiot will still come up with an idiotic plan

Do you know why there is a spike in cases Is it the govt fault to increase dine in to five or is it imported cases Or are we too careless What do you want Lock down
IS Lin Yes you just suggested the perfect solution Lock down is the way to go
Richard A Is this a good thing
Thank you Government and the MTG For the hard work and challenging task it is everyone just pinpoint at the government if you can contribute good suggestions that would be wonderful rather tHan complaining
Yes the government should not rely on medical expert advise just get a smart admin service officer not from medical background and look into how India overcome the delta wave in Goa and Utter grades state by distribution in erection medical kit and why africa being a traditional hotbed of pandemic is relatively unscathEd comparatively to westErn countries after eighteen months of pandemic
Jonathan A next time you have a serious medical illness Maybe you should consider India for Medical Holiday
Michael Go a they solve johnathan problem immediately either he is cure or they dump his body over the river and he is never heard again and forgotten
Jonathan Show india overcome delta wave they just let those who a sick to die after all has died they say they solved the problem you want our gov to do that i a sure or answer is a no no

What travel In doors ready many cases infected with covid People kern quarantine close contacts also got quarantine effected cannot go work all
I think our health care system is not ready for endemic Each talk about your dreams You guys not talking as a team All for your own interest in your area
These clowns are funny
These are highly paid clowns but they re back benches and procrastinators and take united states as guinea pigs Wake up everyone
Please have more VOLs with more countries thanks singapore gov
Scammer gov
Dear respected Ministers I have already fully vaccinated with Pfizer I wanna visit SO very badly can i go visit soon please All got malaysia tinder and bumble matches there and got very lucky dating scene so please see la open up border ore i
do not come now Delay your plan for your safety We have of vaccinated and we still got thousands infected everyday
Hope top fast food centres will start or resume veg burgers that used to be served
I think the PLUs are going bust it would be a pity we really allow them to go jobless
If Singapore does not open borders soon it will be left behind and cutoff Many countries have already opened and have gone back to business as usual
Exactly
Right
Lao all of you guys thinking opening border will do good than harm while the main reason of is the culprit that spread from one place to another Opening borders will have the potential to mutate into new variant which could be worser than current now
Total lock down please Just yesterday we had nineteen importations and not sure what Covid Variants they brought into our shore
Its just not possible now yet Look at the numbers Infection rate skyrocketed despite vaccination
This is not a game of cards It is your life and mine He is not malaysia father
Now I understand your position
Home recovery is not advisable Pigeon hole apartments limitation of space area spreading virus fast especially Delta virus
Can we do something about people coming into singapore our covid cases high and those people who are coming in to Singapore that can have covid can make it more challenging for us
This India variant really sucks This is the problem when CECA pore allowed Ceca people to enter during those times when India was having trouble containing the India Delta variant
Its not india variant you can call it has china virus I do not know how can you pal cal it has indian variant when china has spread it to whole world
The people that were voted in are the people that play out its citizens Vote wisely and remember the covid mess always
Basically citizen just do not enjoy Just keep working
Too many airport terminals so need to Open All
Get the kids vaccinated confused face
Looking horizontally am not are not gonna help you Psalm eleven a four
Brace yourself What you are experiencing now is no longer important to them
Please give united states non China made ear thermometer Locals are locked up in our homes as foreign travellers can come to Singapore using these special lanes so iNteresting I wonder what MiLKY would do if he is still around He loves Singaporeans so much
No rating pratt four me from India
i a sure HE will put singaporean first
Why welcome people in and then restrict the people in the country is movement If you want to open then open all the way Don't just open for the sake of business and please stop using jobs for Singaporeans as an excuse for saying this too many times would only just tell intelligent people that this is not the case Then again we have many who came from lousy schools in this country who are illiterate according to some ministers tHus that's must be how they treat the people who are inutile as they support them
Seal Young Some people just too little to understand anything Poor thing Must be from a really lousy school or just waste of education as he is like Ali Baba with open and close sesame strategy
jobs for singaporean go change bids district park and see job for who
Sounds like malaysia grandad after a bottle of Jack Coke
There should be no different treatment to category four countries All vaccinated travellers should be allowed home quarantine if they have clear are departure and arrival PER and antigen test
Michael Go a you think the whole world can rot but you will happily with your borders closed
iris That's why A should keep hating
Michael Go a every one who is vaccinated should be treated the same irrespective of their race or country a uniform SOP for all the vaccinated travellers coming into so and yes I will continue to hate discrimination
iris why is Singapore with such high vaccination rate continues with such high infection rate
Michael Go a because after high vaccination rate most of the cases are asymptomatic people are transmitting the virus unknowingly if the only thing we look at is the daily case numbers we will never move forward this year we have vaccinations along with self test kits we have become more resilient
Michael Go a we cans variant we need to take a holistic one is safe till everyone is safe can we actually blame any one county for alpha beta delta variants
Michael Go a I am currently quarantined in a hotel with malaysia two or old child i was vaccinated and I had clear are departure PER test oN arrival at cHange i Had another peR And antigen test both clear In the past week in quarantine i had two more antigen tests done both clear Yet I am locked up wHy if I had travelled from category two country I could have quarantined at home question why does the country of origin matter in the first place If an individual is vaccinated with negative PER and antigen test they should be treated the same as category one travellers
During this time can we reduce the number of foreign students coming on Gov free education and focus more on Singapore students since we do not have so much extra budget like in the past sGD a a billions for free foreign education in the past still sustainable Much too money to spent maybe can top our IS men CPS for their two years IS
Seal Young Yes i think our youth who serve their two years IS are well qualify Disappointed that you see any of our Singaporean youth to be qualified aNti sIngaporean again Giving free education to other countries youth make you feel Rather than helping our own Singaporean youth who serving two years IS
is You prefer to train foreign students to be ready to displaced Singaporean youth who serving their two years IS So you want to tell them they do not have the relevant skill set and ask to be food delivery after their IS sIngapore
Give money for them to study is fine as long locals are covered If local student does not receive any support and suffering that is a problem That is just malaysia personal thoughts
Equilibrium Try staying in a seven hundred of house with five people Instead of a bungalow No job or making a few Is a month Instead of a few million a or Get real
Please let the tourists know limited to two dine in No music in restaurants and no alcohol consumption after of pm And there is no nightlife entertainment here too
Why That part of the excitement of travelling during covid right Lots of unexpected lock owns face with tears of joy face with tears of joys exciting
Please open up border with Bangladesh We worker long time waiting for loving Singapore We suffering with family please try to understand thanks
Singapore having trouble with covid nineteen please try to understand thanks
bangladesh is more humble they honestly say they need work here where else south asia delta variant a papaya here behave like gangster say they do many thing for us never they say they actually needs a job here will not be long they going to say they build singapore time will tell things
Its all about control and manipulation No to force vaccination syringe no to the chip no to the mark of the beast Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon folded hand medium light skin towered heart dove REPENt believe in the Gospel bE bOrn aGain
The food point and healthy lifestyle is true for both taxed and untaxed folded hands
That just made as an analogy
Its just what we should do regardless of COVID or what
Plus give leave for indian workers
exactly what the healthy vaccinated do living with healthy lifestyle eating healthy food doing regular exercise less stress having enough rest and yet healthy vaccinated who never got sick not even on medication are being discriminated
Are you sure you are really invincible face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy Want to try kissing a covid patient
Small Hakka being healthy does not equate to your stupidity
delacroix that re healthy you disagree with MTG decisions because you think YOU are very healthy rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
Small hakKa disagree with what vaccination is only useful for a percentage and priority groups of the population younger healthy people and children does not even need that tax and you are foolish of assuming otherwise that why the society is fucked up with people thinking like you
delacroix someone lost his own argument and start cursing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
delacroix a fool turning into a clown face clown face
Small Hakka no further comment to people who obviously come from lousy school
delacroix wow you take pride of which school you came from Want to share your isle score here I will be dead envious rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
We cannot afford to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world but at the rate we are going I am afraid that the rest of the world would cut united states off
Its no cut off
Gods Amazing Grace IMP overcrowded so they let you out
You must be speaking for yourself Can re an undischarged patient of Woodbridge
Seal Young You know why they have to open the border Probably many PLUs are on the verge of going bust That malaysia thinking
Year when ones life is cut off whats left is the underworld which will always be open
I think the PLUs are going bust it would be a pity we really allow them to go jobless
Where did you copy this
It is not only businessmen whose HE IS IN SINGAPORE AND STUDENTS WHO NEED TO GO OVERSEAS FOR THEIR STUDIES THAT REQuire yoUr attention and consideration what about the poor hawkers coffee shops eateries restaurants and all kinds of businesses big medium kept in the fridge a business earnings drop tremendously but still need to pay overhead costs what about profits for their livelihood some stall holders Still have elderly parents or young children in school according to medical science the delta variant is air borne unless you can disinfect the whole country at same time it defeats the purpose of infecting one place today and another place tomorrow but instead causing agony and frustration to each and every singaporean you are worried the hospitals are overwhelmed because you are unable to provide some form of self medication when a person is tested with covid using the art test i was told that in china many are cured by boiling herbs to drink in erection is used by doctors in some parts of the world with covid but in singapore we hear all sorts of reasons that it could not be bought here give the public information on chinese herbs drugs and also western medicine and allow united states to make our own decision how to treat ourselves once tested with covid when we are still well with no symptoms so that we don't need to trouble the hospitals as they cannot cope anymore please adopt an open and consultative method not an authoritative approach
Gods Amazing Grace could the vaccine is a weapon for spreading virus
low face with tears of joy
Eat less meat eat less fried stuffs LOW Covid is not as simple as you think the root source is social interaction which is impossible to avoid completely
Really shows what kind of people are leading the country today
too bad no doctors in the taskforce Then again i believe doctors do not like to dwell on this political nonsense
All disease boils down to your own health and immunity You can never go wrong with a healthier lifestyle
For the social interaction is nothing we can do but its gonna be there fault for having a social interaction doing this period Also stay safe
Hey guys do not go out for unnecessary folded hands
how about if your neighbour is using HUB as House Temple of a burning she also said she did not care that three hundred and eighty six died from secondhand smoke which is not their fault they did not burn then these people got use
Doctor will not say eat less meat or just will say everything in moderation
Covid vaccine is a resistance of covid virus to create new variant it only able to hide the symptoms after get infected at the same time to enhance your immunity system to against the virus temporarily likes ineffectiveness since vaccine maker has been modified it to be safe Vaccine manufacturer can be sued now after ADA fully approve those vaccine this is great liberty status evolution A lot of people death or having long term adverse reaction in vaccination before and the government still keep hiding the truth a
Public space are not ready setup for endemic So opening is OF If you let these visitors stay within VIA premises to settle biz needs If you allow five HUB Projects to is manage Give the jobs to local contractors I am sure many needs jobs now and can be train for the job
Or Gan Kim Yong you saved communication makes a lot of sense Thank you
some are new singaporean but if we a hit badly you will see them packing a leaving
Hopefully the one case imported is not the new variance
Why must make or own Singaporean quarantine and stay home but you keep open border and let tourist come in without quarantine because Singaporean good to bully huh stop roth pratt la make all kinds of grandma grandfather story which they hear also laugh
It vote out our government and ministers when they are not doing their jobs properly
At least tourist got some benefit if they spend here bUt what about foreign students given free university education while our youth serve IS Waste money and take up opportunities that could be given to Singaporean students We give them free education while they might bring more delta in
Never ever change framework to ENDEMIC ideology unless for sure we are ready to sacrifice lives
yep ready
Who is sacrificing lives Do you want to be lock up forever
Even countries like Malaysia who suffered so many casualties are now planning to open up This is the reality of life
IS Lin how far to a pay a to orchard how far johore to koala bumper Dun compare we are go in to the moon one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine face with medical mask
вιℓααℓ of cd is How far is the brain to the mouth
IS Lin ask MTG zipper mouth face
вιℓααℓ of cd is I think the koala bumper guy should have some idea
When thing get worst you come out with more worst same talking again
I agree with the governments idea of equilibrium We can always compromise and half lock down half open up So if a person is asked for one week quarantine we quarantine him during hours where there are most people from morning to mid afternoon then allow him to go out later evening and night Its good for the economy and also can prevent spread
Do you even know if your at all making any sense
Low sorry grinning squinting face I meant quarantined people should be allowed to go out morning to afternoon where productive work is most needed and quarantine only at night since they need to rest anyway
Agree hundred points
Avis tar Avis tar to contradicts the very core objective of a quarantine
How did he become a minister And wait till domestic consumption data takes a hit from elevated virus cases in a one of the most iasi countries in the world
Seal Young i see you everywhere seriously how much you get per post China troll gets a of per post Maybe they had their pay raise How to apply for this job
Here we go again
US and US are least concerned of the Covid of now Just follow what they hurt or kill These is what Pfizer is for The more this bunch talk of guidelines the more fear it creates
Welcome ministers 你們辛苦了 folded hand folded hands
Please open the India to Singapore travel ireland
is a way open one way ticket goodbye thank you for leaving
What bro not open
OAK you gambled and lost
He does not feel a pinch pecos he is not a casualty The worse scenario he get is to head a corporation in Tease or PIC Nothing to lose GUarantee Return Maybe is what he hope for
Clap for lord of the ring speech face with tears of joy
Please trust and support our government
You should know that statistics is never accurate
of its not stats is a percentage of what they calculate even so its inaccurate what about the official number of cases that are not am not in the stats
The current statistics is not accurate as most population are still in partial lock in mode and the infection is not control People cannot be in partial lock in mode Than you can see the real pattern
You need to look from the perspective of the gov then you understand why the statistics is not accurate
Eat Less Meat Is protein not an essential nutrition anymore
I think he meant TOM Traditional Chinese medicine methodology patient needs to eat something light like vegetable soup porridge in order to recover from illness
ian Of do not think he ever mentioned TOM Besides let us not have TOM be a consideration and maintain our actions on scientific bases
Today saw parents allow their children to mask down at TUE consuming ice cream while shopping in between the various shopping corridor All public toilet should be heat treated at least twice a day
yes the public toilet is where most pal with blow their nose site a wash their mouth most who eat out will use their toilet
are not am not tired of being so paranoid for so long We can die of many other illnesses too not just covid Live and let live
Don't expect of a cooperation
time to give out money he the that the easy way out
Herd immunity strategy
Herd Immunity will not happen How Wonderful
Sir your on the ground infrastructure is still not ready for endemics tHe new email france reach when you know how to contain the delta virus when all singaporean citizen and migrant workers can be out in our own space first with day to day activities can be conducted with of a mask on as law as long as people are outdoor or with one other person
Simply these three ministers represent the three blind mice They are lost at seat afford to copy them blindly SKY has always alluded Singapore to an artificial nation
low Singapore is the top Asian country in ranking in terms of covid resilience and is higher then all the countries you mentioned here but ageing singaporeans like to always complain govt even if facts say we are a global leader
Pawnee In an open ending pandemic GAP self reliance
Charles Go I am talking about current ranking about covid Google best country handling covid or best covid economy act and singapore and scandinavian countries consistently tops the list for transparency and endemic planning So the whole world is praising singapore except a vocal minority of older Singaporeans
Pawnee Top countries in handling covid are NO China HE trust fake news There is no cure for stupidity of your kind
Pawnee Do you know the difference between administrators never had to stake out for a living Probably you had never use your brain too judging from your mentality
three blind mice but highest paid mice in the world
Not true They are trying Singapore to be endemic Clearly it did not went as well as predicted They never dare to do this before vaccination reach a certain percentage
ORC you are talking cock Virus and human co exists ARE YOU GOD you are a backdoor shove in minister
There sad to see the cynical comments here jeering and mocking
no proven path can you see how US and US already open up Their vaccination rate is still below ours I am starting to doubt these MTG to be able to handle this
Ali Iraqi what was the death rate in US and US Are you saying SO should go down the same path to let so many die
Small Hakka then why the MTG ALWAYS SOUNDING ABOUT COVID RESILIENT NATION ENDEMIC ETC THEY ALWAYS ECHOING THIS BEFore the mass vaccination campaign around mid year thAt after we reaching eighty percent vaccination we can start to opening up in reality they are not preparing this they should walk the talk
Seal Young I agree opening up is need to do it step by step but this feels like you do one step ahead and then three step backwards they announce that we are going to face endemic situation a long time ago they should prepare the scenario like this and not make the backward step
and I do not know why some people think the MTG are bulletproof for criticism they are the highest paid leaders in the world and with how they handle the situation now it seems they are looks overpaid
Seal Young Of course less casualties but with what happens now it feels like the MTG do not prepare this scenario before they have time to plan this before they should preparing all the healthcare system to get ready for the endemic situation i do not see that now
Ali Iraqi Covid resilient nation Who has ever said that
Vaccinated and not infected are not the one spreading the virus iTs those vaccinated break thru and asymptomatic which are spreading the stronger mutated virus Opening allowing a few thousands visitors is not going to fixed VIA To a a a a situations No more long term and short term pass should be allow uNtil this wave can come under control and let the sIngaporean citizen and all on the ground proof test all the new setup
Hama meat is okay bro Go for organic grass fed beef and pasteurised kampong chicken
Global minimum tax for MACs locking out the world Singapore viable hub
Seal Young who cares about happy or sad
gov flipping roth pratt Cannot sell singapore anymore vaccinated elderly are the one to pay the price Stop boasting two dose are fully three doses are than considered fully vaccinated
he has he is annoying to watch face with rolling eyes Just get to the point
That is how they confused most of the people
cannot Convince the Citizens Confuse them
It was cringe
I am totally disgusted face vomiting face vomiting face vomiting
The analogy does not explain the equilibrium that he kept on stressing
He needed to explain to the illiterates so that they can understand better
of of How to be convinced when people are illiterate and came from lousy schools You are much better
Angeline See illiterate Was there anything to read in the video Besides his analogies often do not properly explain the original statements made
Sharon Chen Does illiterate only mean cant read Now I begin to see what how the Minister thinks I guess too many of them in the country to make our elites think so as I can see an example here
Seal Young Art losers the ones who liked to be called via huey illiterate and come from lousy schools I guess too many of them coming out to call out others without looking at themselves in the mirror wEll that's why they don't mind infected and better still their children to be infected eVen they don't have children they are people who are so selfish that they don't even think of their own parents Now we can see the kind of losers we have
Seal Young False accusation is at its finest A pity that till date people just don't even know much about karma and almighty as they continue to live with their malice No wonder things are the way they are because we have too many bad spirits around
Seal Young Guess who will be willing to have their parents dead with the virus going That's why open without contingency plan is once again at its finest
Angeline See iLliterate means unable to read or write Please look it up before posting sweeping assumptions of people here Perhaps you could also consider that part of helping people to understand better is by getting to the point quickly before he loses the audiences for a whole other argument My comments from the start of this thread have always been about HOW he said something and not what he said
Sharon Chen With that I agreed with you that this government never seems to learn from the past and their risk approach they have been taking often get out of hand and then they start doing something tHere don't seems to be contingency plan in place as they are cock sure of themselves and everyone around them will nod their hands like those big head dolls tHat's why lives to them are just numbers and they are so out of touch with the people as they are holed up in their own ivory tower Unfortunately we don't have too many smart people who don't know better
Seal Young It is most unfortunate that many people who think they are smart don't know that they are otherwise Xenophobic and racism have always been used by politicians for their own agendas Only the super smart will see through that Just so unfortunate that we have too many people who pretend to be smart
Seal Young Go to the ground to find out more before you regurgitate what you have been told We are able to survive because of the hard work of our forefather who sacrificed for this country and stop thinking that we we were a fishing by village before the PAP told over aLso it is the people in this country who gave up their rights to bring this country what it is today tAlents investors They all left when they made the money to enjoy their twilight years while the people of this land continue to toil Wake up to the reality of the world today and you will know why your age group are dropping off like flies yOu'll know that what goes around comes around and debts will always needed to be paid up when one trade with the devil bEsides how many people have their ancestors buried here to know that they are no longer a migrant Go tell the Americans Australians and Canadian that they had been a migrant as well
Seal Young Everything is according to what you see isn't it People just need to know that every action there is a reaction Everything is written on the wall and people are still asking why When one takes a risk whether one wins or loses will depend on divine intervention haVen't you learn that in history
I love this carnival The clowns are also good in cooking pratt
Same Tired
Awesome comment It is hilarious Frivolous comments from the net zens too the many self appointed health experts a visionaries of economy a national progress let us chill over some chain pratt a Lola
as we know delta variants is very contagious after allowing so many delta variant in is naturally everyone will be good at cooking pratt
sally Be less xenophobic
A bit like this Six packs Our body needs an equilibrium of muscles and fats
Please open the border for all countries but vaccine should be mandatory At least those are working here should be allowed with strict quarantine rule
Working from shall be mandatory Do not say vague word deFault its useless Some company pretending essential services asking employees to go office exposing themselves into risk eMployees are also mingling here and there high chance of spreading virus if anyone infected
they say default because not everyone can work from home may like those in security banks and IT
We should hire Malaysia minister of health they seems to be doing a great job
Hope Dope mistake happens but that does not mean they are not doing a good job
Malaysia Great job LOYOLA LOW
By Malaysia trajectory they should be zero case in thirteen days face with tears of joy
Seal Young because Singaporeans are working for me
True Cheaper also Plus they know how to seek funding themselves You know what I mean
Yes plus open borders Need a real break and improve mental health or at least reduce TO cos lengthy TO Harm mental health
Main Al khan did not the visitors from Germany just fly in What you talking about fly to Germany if you want also nobody preventing you from going

Funny He is teaching people how to be healthy This will be very frustrating
he has he is not teaching united states to be healthy you do not understand Low
More like amusing tHese rants a hallmarks of pitching to the citizens but with a large dose of educated knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease Wanting to bring competitive edge to the economy requires careful a calculated measures a should never be at the cost of safety
Gave up listening to the taskforce brady Last yrs recent press conferences talk are getting on malaysia nerves Esp when numbers keep go up Would Rather just follow the rules Simpler this way
shorten work hours for shipyard and construction worker who work twelve hours a day then they will have enough rest a better immune system
Plus family friends country safe is much more important than everything at this moments much more important than economic I wanna everyone safe
Hope Dope agree
Agree Who wants family members to become some statistics data Take care everyone Pray if you can
Travel lane not meant for all Not all humans are same Not nice to hear but it is the truth Actually you are talking about it also Health Natural selection And why certain people Bop an one
One thing is clear pM lEe oaK and Lawrence are poor communicators tHey have successfully confused sIngaporeans The government message we are getting now hElp yourself if you get cOvid do not expect the government to help
No agenda Go it and watch lee sign long no speeches
You are just naysayers Nothing good come out of your mouths

I thought they are multilingual
Are they from Raffles
Can you for once encourage our people to pray and seek God for Mercy
Human beings and virus can co exist Talk cock We need to vanquish the virus
Thank god opening borders are still on the agenda COVID nineteen cannot cost Singapore Airlines or Change Airport more Lets fight through this pandemic and hopefully SO aviation will thrive again
You cam up lorry if you like travel
Like how swiss standard of living is forever on agenda
AND certain things just do not happen
Some things and luxuries do not last forever
Can I go to Malaysia by road Are the borders open
Or Gan are you from some school seems you cannot even speak properly

Same school as our PM clinking glasses
You are from Myanmar
Share with you how to stay at home DAY OUT UNIT Co DATA LIZARD TAIL CREAM to fight Covid We should give it a try to explore every avenue aim to slow down the increasing exponential wave of transmission

I am not Indian and I agree with you Such border restrictions are due to be lifted Some people on YouTube are xenophobic ignore them
Just shut up and stay home in india we have kids and parents that cannot be vaccinated and their lives is on stake and here you are talking about politics what a idiot

Multiple Times Failures for these so called ITs
Yes Don't agree Well done Ministers They have done their best for So
Agnes Que You and Lisa made a perfect dumbo twins Can sign up for the circus
i can think of a better insult with that acronym way better insult
Well Said Cant think of any PAP Team WORST than the current
Too all new SO citizen eggs by keeping every busy
This covid not so easy to control they has try their best Singaporeans will follow
singapore follow but i see many ceca no follow go out a see for ourself
Equilibrium with sacrificing life
well you care about some other bloke dying you really do care swear on your life
you must be a lonely person
Anna UP I am perfectly balanced as all things should be
Why don't they bother to get vaccinated in the first place
where are the travel bubbles
Fully vaccinated person in the Philippines is included
Dey when singapore open to india
People that think that vaccine will not be mandatory is in denial Pretty soon the vaccine will needed for everything Work travel restaurants concerts etc Coming to a country near you
Stop it has it is a virus that has been around for ever Vaccinate and live with it
The US A of a of a it has it is not a problem at all But India of Of a of no you can not enter
I had I would rather trust the of a of a from the US than the supposedly of of a from india
Cactus hence proved
Politics or public health
dumb a dumber measures
Is Singapore open for Indian
Please open bantam border
Relax smile plus thinking face
Before opening up to even more people from abroad why not ensure that everyone already in Singapore is able to get a vaccine first wHen can short term pass visitors here due to the pandemic get vaccinated Singapore is relaxing restrictions starting tomorrow yet no announcement made how we can also be safe If I ask for a vaccination i currently get rejected i would gladly pay for malaysia vaccine
Poor quality food lack of exercise and expensive Healthcare
The economy hardship recession unemployment and loss of job caused by covid pandemic is enough to push people into financial ventures
I have secured financial freedom by Investing in bonds equities EFTs and some digital currencies
Smith Will son I wanted to invest more on digital currencies cry to but the fluctuations in cry to value discourage me into dumping
that there own finances
its a time to be investing with Mrs Bella
amid Jamie wow It know her she is really good and awesome
Neil McCoy Mrs Bella obviously the best broker I invested a of a with her and she made me profit of of a in two weeks and three days It was mind blowing
I am also a beneficiary as well Trade expert Bella changed malaysia a eTC to a eTC her trading methodology proves her expertise
Due to recent volatility in cry to value I had some loss which depreciated malaysia Doge coins ARP because I was holding
I need her info so I can start trading with her Is she on facebook or what has what is app How can I get her

GEorge Jones I have made of of a working with her
Really my the only one she helped walk through the fears and falls of trading
I have seen different recommendations about this Pro trader she must be very exceptional for the talk this about her
I did not care about the government All thanks to crypt currency
Currently in this phase of life Bit coin is already making legitimate and profitable way for investment
Reluctant people will not be able to understand this until its late for them
Bit coin and Fore trading is of a safe with an expert to avoid losses and risk people go into bit coin wrongly that why they always complain about losses see
Ervin Miller The mean reason why I like investing in Bit coin is that its not in the government system
Bit coin is the future even the Elites in US are investing massive in Bit coin and Fore Bit coin is obviously the new digital gold

Mrs Bella is a blessing to humanity at large Investing with her is the best decision so far
Thanks to SEA share I now cashing few millions from the stocks Shoppe stock is a go Term ask share is a go
If current vaccine alone do not slow down the spread of delta variant why is Singapore still dishing privileges to travellers who are vaccinated I do not get it
Lipstick makers are complaining that mask makers have taken away their business Can we make and approve see through masks so that lipstick makers can still make a living
You guys have strive hard However in the face of delta variants and silly Immigration rules you need to give your ALL Look beyond vaccines Do not trust WHO completely
Israel is seriously studying In erection SO should carry out our own studies
Foolish to assume that the vaccinated are immune to Delta and Delta plus variants Read Massachusetts Bad not to include In erection
Their To Go That is funding their retirement funds after Covid over
Why do I have a nagging suspicion that opening now is not such a good idea
My Go hand phone law Low
Thank you very much
Sure what you gonna do as the cECA lane all be undoubtedly fully vaccinated as per your requirements who comes with fake certs as widely expected What kind of detection verification regime old you put in place Judging from your incompetence to rein in fake educational certs after years of dealing with pm it is not cynical to doubt your ability from the word go Prove it to Singaporeans you can manage CECA its massive racism against the local PET well before we can trust you do something right about the life death of spOrrans
No action talk only
Thousands from the land of Variant A waiting to come with their family baggage with fake degrees and now with fake vaccination certificates Hopefully we will not reach a stage where we will have to resort to throwing dead bodies into Singapore river
Warped logic
Is China safe How about our neighbour Malaysia Is this fair
Mentioned many times cannot afford to offend China India Indonesia details not imp glad open borders with open arms after nineteen aug suggest no need screening just crossover since we are so confident
With plans to open travel lanes for selected countries how many infections and deaths are acceptable
I think two hundred per day was mentioned Now they said they have one thousand ICE beds
This is going no where Open close open close repeat Just move on already Even after year a with vaccine Seems like still at square a
We have of kids not vaccinated yet There's news that approval for vaccination for age a of will come end Sept and Nov
My mistake Ditsy Girl No wonder such foolish thoughts thought balloon
Shield Tee foolish in what sense Foolish for vaccinating kids or the news of vaccination itself is foolish Can you be clear
Ditsy Girl We took it for granted that two dosages of Anywhere Big Parma are paddling like a snake snake oil seller is the Magic Pill for the Ones in Office Incompetence
Only child abuser might think of such things
hi sir please allow fully vaccinated US people to enter into SO without SHE please thank you And a travel bubble with Australia too
Vaccinated infected person shows Low viral loads This is different from recent reports from recent YouTube reports from many countries
what do you mean recent youtube reports
There will always be low IN people out there who believe in anything they see in youtube tip to gap chat instead of peered review medical papers
it has it is not time to open any sooner Face the consequences of this decision worse is yet to Come
Trash force talking Trash wastebasket again
COVID nineteen is here to stay so we need some sensibility Opening and closing will destroy our economy any moron minister can do it On be King will make a good PM
overrides logical thinking and sense
do not know what kind of new virus or variants they will bring in
it has it is fair and justified that the vaccinated get the privilege for more freedom of movement and entry to certain establishment
Yes if you refuse to get vaccinated like everybody else and do not do your part to help control the infections where you may be seriously ill hospitalized and even death to yourself or your family and your country man you should just sit and home and do not get any privilege to go any places Why should the vaccinated people be punish with your ignorant and selfish act
No more bubbles Now changed to lanes
Foolish exchanges Get vexed and receive all these cravings
Vaccine does not mean no infections People still can be carrier even they are vaccinated
And they can still be critically ill
Then closed the economy forever
So the economy will be close for how long Don't you think that the situation will remain like this if they did not open up it will be phase two phase three phase two phase three for ever
What are the selected country eligible to travel Singapore with out quarantine
May I ask what and why is this Minister of Health who is not medically trained announcing about allowing work pass holders and their dependents from higher risk countries to enter Singapore Why are we opening the border at this juncture when Singapore is still having many cases linked and unlinked while so many other countries are seeing surging infections from the delta variant and higher risk country like India is warning of yet another third wave coming aRen't the Minister of Health and the Ministerial Task Force too complacent and too foolhardy AGAIN to ignore all these disturbing signs that the dangerous variants will hit united states adversely oNCE aGAIN whY are they in such a hurry
And the black fungus covid from India
Because money
Useless gov
AnonyMous if you think the singapore government is useless please pack your bag and moved to other countries maybe some african countries where they are only a vaccinated and will give anything to get the vaccinations singapore seems to be doing a good job in controlling and getting most of the citizeNs vaccinated at this time by comparison to many many other countries well basically you are the useless one just know hOw to make uneducated comment
hair Lib Why such hatred against India
Do not take it too lightly as situation worldwide is getting worse despite full vaccination
Sarah Glam not hatred just pure fear You know how terrifying the black fungus disease are
HAIR LIB I UNDERSTAND YOUR SENTIMENT BUT THE DELTA VARIANT CAN COME ANY COUNTRY NOT ONLY INDIA IT IS A BIT SADDENING TO SEE WHY ALL COUNTRIES ARE LABELLING INDIA AS THE CULPrit oRigiNator for this causing buildiNg animoSity aGainst indians hope you understand our SentimeNts smiling face with smiling eyes
Sarah glam it has it is the deadly blaCk fungus infections that i feared the most not exactly delta did not meant to hurt the feelings of indians i just want to remind our gov not to open our borders to any countries so soon we must seat back and observe whether the vaccines are effective against the new variants or not this is not the correct timing to open up
After some time it will have to close again Just like Israel
Unless you keep up with the tax passport ord and eth booster shots are now mandatory in Israel
Israel got Ben and Jerry or not
Ethan Eros do not dream of any travelling plan the best you can experience is bin
Every two months open and close virus would take at least one hundred years to disappear
We hope not
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joY i hate to say we told you so face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy China his favourite Bubblegum Nation is in total chaos right now The Arrogance Ignorance of this man alone will make what you just commented come true
Step by step to relax the social rules can maintain high levels of public health and security of country
It is GUIDED democracy Same for the international airline industries which will require all to be vaccinated in order to FLY again
It speak Mandarin with any level of comfort Please leave it to On Be King when it comes to Mandarin
That is why I told malaysia children that their children have to be fluent in both English and Chinese as these will be the working languages of the world by the time they start working I notice some grandparents with limited ability in English language speaking to their grandchildren in rotten English It is better for the grandchildren to be spoken to in Mandarin I make sure malaysia grandchildren are fluent in both My three children are already fluent in both
the taskforce should all step down totally useless
I agree
Useless shameless incompetent
believe i the a vaccine will destroy their plan die die do not vaccine
If Indians could fake degrees and get high paying civil service jobs how difficult to falsify vaccine certification
Still refuse to learn
Vaccinated people are super carriers the virus lay dormant and undetectable However should the host got sick from other ailments a compromise immune system happens and covid reactivates to multiply
Vaccine is the real danger
I just cannot believe the amount of is i a orca centres tribal corridor rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
those are auto generated by youtube so
SO Is diction Some of the worst IT captions are generated by Singaporean accents low
India cannot be trusted Do not accept any health documentation from these jokers They have fake qualifications and fake employment history thus fake experience
Still have not learned
What timing now everywhere got virus you still want united states all go get it and bring back
i hope Including Philippines
four common good kindly try Virgin Coconut Oil against delta variant
Singapore government has done a great job in managing this pandemic No country can survive with their border and economy shut down for longer than necessary Push the vaccination rate as high as possible to keep the hospitalization and deaths down to a manageable level then open up us TOOK that gamble Bravo to Singapore leaders for their great leadership
The jabbed catch and spread the virus just the same FRI
Yes continue wearing mask thumbs up
No thanks With so many unlinked untraceable cases daily no one is risking their lives to go to Singapore
scary cat go play in the cave
Lawrence Chef fifty eight hope you wont end up in ICE And shortness of breath after you recover See which is more scary
except those from malaysia indonesia india brazil
Desperado wanna earn money A think pal wanna travel Going other country ken quarantine or must go certain regulation coming back singapore also must go certain regulation
A are not desperate Money drop from sky Or the reserve is unlimited a
did not they make enough money with the vaccines already
What about India
Those Alexander Sent a Raffle heat big big getting the vaccination contracts from MON
We Parma hub may so must support industry nothing else matters
Carol Catherine iron bowl
Actually they are paying licensing fee up to a couple of millions to administer the vaccine syringe It is a double edged sword
Shield Tee Don't worry The prices are inflated to cover the licensing fee But common folks wont know the actual number until politicians ask about it in Parliament
eleven That went OUT THE WINDOW just like their De corn Measuring Tools a long long long time ago zany face
How about differentiating smokers and non smokers
How about differentiating Durian Sellers and Durian Eaters
Yeah damn those smokers using up all our I Us
CAL As reported around the world actually the vaccinated are hoarding the lots there so be ensured to be full vaccinated and its time now to mandate full vaccination
Great
Wanna bow to to ceca again Ceca lots of fake vaccination certs
Singapore needs to open its borders if you cant see that you are a fool
Bullshit Both vaccinated and vaccinated carry an equal about of virus The director of CD and fact have said as much do not talk through your arse
that prat
Good Luck with this
It would be good to have Ministers who are qualified in the field of medicine to head the task force than one who have to rely on notes from other medical doctors to read the notes
Common sense is more important than a medical doctor that go by the book just to play safe and protect himself
SHE or TO is necessary as some developed the illness during the SHE TO period plus do not compromise human life for money sake any tourist coming in have to pay for their TO and serve their TO before allow to roam the land
LoW if many donkeys years peoples may believed but now two thousand and twenty one not one thousand nine hundred and eighty Money can buy everything In this world the most scared was human
Hama finally I saw the real purpose Thanks for creating all the smoke screen again
thumbs up
the to dormitory fish market fiesta are just drama for the end result vaccine profits
of a pct of cases have zero or mild symptoms Quite a bold statement and begs the question has closing the world really been worth it
The great reset is the real reason
Vaccinated also can harbour covid
They are The Super Spreaders
They are the carriers
Vaccine not working well in word
Harmless in of
Press sir open united states fro work singapore bangladeshi will be vaccine entire
No Thanks Singapore has one hundred and twenty two Indian Variant Clusters NOW
NO WAY smiling face with horns
they FIRST ALLOWED Chinese Wuhan Virus in Jan two thousand and twenty OF then came Indian variant angry face
Work than very lazy we singapore people are very kind to let you come to singapore and doing nothing just move around and like ball must kind then move and every things also dun understand or hard to under must say ten time then understanding
Please state the countries else it will just be empty promise
iGn MTG WANTS DOES NOT OTHER COUNTRIES WANT JAP HAS OF of cases and one hUNDrEd and twenty two clusters all over the island who is so Dumb to Open NO Quarantine Travel when Delta Variant is Running Rampant All Over SINGAPORE
be prepared to welcome delta plus
India and China la you so blur you need to ask is question
How come the authorities can force people to vaccinate
Singapore definition of democracy
Here so fortunate other countries this type of announcement will result in mass protests and riots
That because you need permission to protest here face with rolling eyes
one hundred Hmm and we do not want or need anything like THAT to happen here smirking face
OR Of course you wouldn't missed the point as usual expressionless face
Everyone scared of section fifty five law
False documentation of vaccination will be caned and jailed
Cane not enough bro Looking at how many people in the community that may get killed in this and the economic impact I think must be by death punishment and or caning in public
Of pizzazz so many indians with fake cert came in ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPEN TO THEM
but false cert from ceca will just be send back home
Vaccinated now is the Privileged
Nope The rich are still the privileged
I think all they want is money
Arch now we can know who is fully vac and who is not when going to Bantam
red heart
Whenever you make such decisions please law have your team think of how people will try to find loopholes and exploit such measures and take them into account There will always be some who will try to do this
You assuming THEY ARE THINKING grinning face with sweat This is the end product
a how will you ascertain that whatever certification needed are genuine
The vaccinated sheep are going to be happy
For three years at the most
Whatever plan it does not make sense create more cluster in Singapore Now the world is having more cases
Selected countries
I would like to know how Singapore Government to detect falsified Vaccination Cert or record Otherwise Singaporean and residents are at risk
Most advanced countries have electronic certificates on their mobile app in which the personal details should tally with their passports I presume
Far rah Kong US doesn't profiling is illegal in the US
Far rah Kong The breach can have serious consequences
Come on everyone you got money everything can buy most scared was human
GAoler Pc When this happen in Singapore no matter how much money you have you can not bring it to after life
TO Now There is no photo on our vaccination certificate
So the name in your driving licence can be different from that in your passport
Far rah Kong Photo no photo doesn't matter Falsified doc can be done easily
true it can be seen in video their vaccination only needle goes in no vaccine or who knows its just saline water
BY Can share the video link here Thanks
Everything we do everything in life is full of risks But we still live
Vaccinated still spread Delta you mean vaccinated are at risk
BY If you develop fever like most people strain on your arms next day or any other minor side effects you will know its the real vaccine
Stranded two thousand and twenty Please advice talk to those vaccinated go discuss with doctor and get high efficacy vaccine jab Low efficacy vaccine simply can not stop spread and might create a false sense of security as this virus are easy to spread
CD study shows of of people infected in Massachusetts Covid outbreak were fully vaccinated
but how many ceca folks falsified their cert a these dumb administration bought them hook line and sinker
Ethan Eros Please provide your source to proof it
Ethan Eros For the virus can survive on human nose because it is far away from the humans immune system Therefore wear mask is necessary until of to of of the population is vaccinated
Ethan Eros The other one I don't bother to check since the two recommended video found to have falsified information
TO No Prince Charles speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davis

smiling face with heart eye smiling face with heart eye smiling face with heart eyes
Make sure only fully vaccinated travellers to entry Singapore face with medical mask grinning squinting face
Please do see what is happening in US Irregardless of vaccination the infection is exploding again there
On Ernie Nothing is exploding there and hospitalisations death rates remain relatively low check the figures state by state Hence Get vaccinated asap
Daniel runner The vaccinated are spreading the delta syringe face with medical mask
On Ernie There is no such word as
Snowflake Melter There is a typo in your message the vaccinated are spreading the delta so get vaccinated asap if you are responsible
Daniel runner Nope it is the jabbed spreading of everywhere face with medical mask
Snowflake Melter vaccinated people are spreading it all over the place irresponsible and selfish If you want to safe lives get vaccinated asap OF
Daniel runner The jabbed are the carriers of the delta They are spreading it everywhere are too selfish to quarantine face with medical mask
On Ernie same in united kingdom but ministers say be prepared and its no big deal since hospitals are not overwhelmed Higher infection rates is a given
Snowflake Melter yes you are right because many dun think they can get infected after vaccination Fact is when more get vaccinated more of the infected are the from the vaccinated
Daniel runner the vaccine fail most of vaccinated in israel is in ice
A Show Variant OF tow Now variant A vaccinated so spread in like wildfires via you wan allow more to come in face with symbols on mouth
how long you wanna lock down bro until singapore is bankrupt and we all begging on the streets
iran Raj death equals to nothing
Why do we allow China
because the whole china has less daily case than singapore has for the past two weeks
China has vaccinated a a billion doses to its population
Cos they have the money bag money bag See how many FeB are Owned a Run by China Chinese
China Chinese who goes to another usually set up food business and are self reliant In most if not all the countries they go to they are not a burden to those countries
this shows how naive you are
a it was a genuine question are you targeting your remark at malaysia question Or some other commenter responses
Its china ore
No to China at the moment folded hands
China Nader you STUPID or wat
Yeah I want vaccinated travel bubble to be set up with India US and Brazil please Emma of yah and Malaysia not to forget
No no please not Malaysia You want to die a coming from one who is a Asian
All of you must remember wuhan virus started from china now the whole world is suffering with mutated virus
Once yous the point in getting vaccinated then
YES of because it still spreads
and you still get infected and spread to others the only plausible argument now is that you are less likely to die
of a so gonna wear masks forever then
Is To Ching giving out free mask those candy cat use Not
FiG of I take the two free ones
vaccination is to reduce the risk once you get infected not a cure are you dumb or what
Those vex rated must be wary of flu because of cytokines storm The irony
TO Virologist graduated from University of YouTube
Dengue vex because cytokines storm if different strains Nov and flu different strains of corona so
Dengue vex because cytokines storm if different strains Nov and flu different strains of corona so
its a trick
Primary school should be the top concern as more than of of the students are below yrs and vaccinated A more comprehensive plan involving test like ART should be conducted to protect the students and educators Global travel plans must also include emotional considerations especially for immediate family members who have no chance to unite serious emotional stress is piling for these families and not just for economic considerations
Where do you get the magic of from
They are Discriminated from Dining out with their families
stop abusing children
Discrimination against those who Cannot accept mANA but yet Still NO Non mANA vaccine available on National Program Worst than Racism
NIP Songs For Singapore Royals nor take advice from peasants
Low looks like its either you miss some part of this latest meeting or you choose to ignore face with tears of joy
Non vaccinated people with negative PER test enjoy the same privilege as vaccinated people Singapore offers non mANA vaccines which are Sin vac and Sin charm What you complaining about
On a Is Sin vac a Sin charm on National Program
Go watch the other segment dude by you look like some troll
On a vince carlo complains on every update Its his job or hobby
Regardless of RACE LANGUAGE or RELIGION never say Vaccination
imagine if a reporter were to ask these ministers the reaction will be worst than three stooges scrambling for cover
Fred Mad All mach am chit chatting in each other living room ask or dun ask no difference
JAP Has of of Cases a created one hundred and twenty two Clusters but Intends to Open NO Quarantine Travel in Sep UNBELIEVABLE
A very sensible pragmatic logical approach Kudos to the Singapore Government for taking steps to restore some semblance of normalcy within a well charted approach towards protection from Covid the sustainability of our Economic survival as a Nation
Anyone who study biology of virology will know this will backfire and result in more serious infection
what is abnormal insensible and illogical is that the mTG IS PROCEEDING TO OPEN THE BORDERS WHEN WE SEE NEW CLUSTERS DISCOVERED EVERY DAY IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHEN WE ARE EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE ON MAY THIRTEEN WITH THE DAILY CASES DESPITE TWELVE WEEKS OF heightened alert let us see how the mtg can grow the economy when daily cases hit thousands every day thought the mtg already learnt the lesson last year remember what einstein said about insaNity
Kathy Him anyone who study economic will know Singapore cannot afford to stay lock down
Small Hakka no need to study economic to know life is more valuable than money
Richard Wong Yep Survival is more important and SO cannot survive if continue to close border for another ten years

Yes but please stop the VOL so we will not spread this Omicron which will effect Singaporeans
Close borders forever hMm your country will be poorer than any of your neighbours maybe wanna have a talk with someone in Africa still waiting for their vaccine Government is doing what they should be doing aLways complain complain you wanna be a politician right now Us peasants always think we know better
Eva a You are really illogical When your citizens die of the virus there is no economy When your neighbours die off you become stronger as the only ones left

At what cost Their drive to jab younger and younger kids
They allowed people with omicron to land in SO and now talking about curbing locals life at risks
Blaming the unix is a sin

Israel may switch to policy of herd immunity through mass infection as vaccines fail against Omicron
What is the when in fact to a certain degree most do not agree with them but the fear of losing their jobs and the restrictions imposed upon thereof
They look haggard Omicron is said to be milder
Its milder

Eva so was the benefits of the vaccine
Old Lee I understand why you are frustrated but you really need to do the right research of course you get covid if you are vaccinated we will all get it in our life time even a few times maybe but statistics prove the chances are hugely lower that you end up in ice if you vaccinated we have come so far in medicine mana is revolutionary in future it might even heal cancer its not all bad have faith in science but its been two years with covid anti valuers don't change their minds anymore
Eva but I never see any data about it and I got heart clamp after second Jab Very dangerous for me Nobody can tell me what the benefits of the vaccine i nearly died even before i contact comic after jab
Low Lawrence sounds frustrated What A Failure Of A Minister
India records first Omicron death Warns transmissions spread a a times faster than Delta

Not to stop Omicron Got the message

Philip New Well said
Thumbs Up to the decisions made during the press conference
Thumbs up thumbs up
From MILF clowns response on tO yesterday they are only concerned about and protecting singaPore is hubs reputation They even blamed Singaporean Locals Now when THEY knowingly Allowed VOLs non VOLs infected Travellers remember infected ceca travellers to infect our local communities blaming omicron already exists in our local communities and locals complacency Clark quay new year party These clowns are finding excuses reasons to let in infected travellers into Singapore and telling Singaporeans to accept living with covid
They do need someone to take blame and it just happen that local singaporean to do anything to them And many still either sleeping or still believe in all the fairytale they said it just a sad thing
These ministers slow not up to date now got another new variant tHU in France France so he warn you'll got a super ave coming I also can warn you'll a few things One world government
When you said to live with covid without a clear plan you are like opening a can of worms
What is your plan
Why we have to plan for them They are earning millions We were told they are elites
Amp cos close border book
Avenue Five If you have no plans then leave to those who have Just zip up your gap hole and let them lead
Said funding Said When govt opened borders there were less toxic comments online but once we closed borders and stopped the VOL waal you'll see the most vicious and spiteful comments coming from foreigners esp those from the north all just wanting to use Singapore as a haven to escape from their own miserable conditions back in their own homeland oN the other hand citizens want government to close up everything
of Are you stupid or I am stupid My grandfather told me if no millions dollar salary cannot attract top talents to be minister I watch news and read ST everyday
Avenue Five Go get your mon to wipe your behind and learn to make your bed before you rush out to save the world Superheroes do that kid
CD Lee Relax old man do not suffocate yourself old man
Its no longer a can of worms but a field of rats
University at Buffalo US
Is these what we call speedy respond These is what we are paying for When we started the VOL the Omicron is already spreading like fire But we still as cool as cucumber
Can you suggest something better They are human beings Are you being fair in your comment
Like what they mention they are not tightening border we have to start living with the virus Govt are not bothered at united states already
Amp cos we pay top dollar we expect top performance
Amp cos yes I can suggest something better I have suggested so I would never
Said funding Said we cannot be doing a western policy that will fail How can we live die with a virus that is changing We cannot live with something we do not know about Simple commonsense This is the root flaw in this promotion
Wei wang Lee So How Cannot live with something you do not know
AMP COS USE YOUR Brains do not let it come in with open welcome and say it is inevitable for starters i am running this show my role is avoiding logical pitfalls via admInistrative environments to try to stay safe
Amp cos Humans Fair After the way they treat the marginalised Now playing victim they expect sympathy pouting face
Amp cos why bother suggest how about you yourself talk to their face You seems to be an intellectual with high level of confidence
A very prudent and competent spore govt Bravo
More like pile of poo pile of poo pile of poo
Its hard to suffer here Only ferns and inedible plants
Delta omicron media control its all about control and manipulation No to poison skull and crossbones vaccines syringe Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon folded hand medium light skin towered heart dove REPENt believe in the Gospel bE bOrn aGain
No way to escape
Countries with high import cases a think it is okay taKe no action Talk about reputation is not these people coming in already tested but still so many cases It clearly show the are travelled test is not effective
Import la import some more then later place more restrictions on united states poor citizens cos of foreigners screens always get punished by of foreigners
Era excuse me since when are we seriously consider as one I feel living in a big family own Corporation than in a country
The omicron is in our community Now they are panicking
thirty eight Seniors unix you are not alone
Talk to the public not in conference call
Spot on
They cant They read from scripts and unable to handle a debate questions posed by the public
Ming Chan SKY was the best
Roth pratt good to eat
Play with words and numbers Using owned and control Media like CAN to control what others should hear Making up all kind of to make you look competent in your work
What a joke what testing The expired emergency use of ART PER testing cd openly acknowledge these Does NOT WORK and they have expired This your standard tHis is as a am de a i a Its the vaccinated that are infected
So this team is bent on according of a freedom in importing the virus variants while restricting the citizens freedom to gather socialise work earn a living What an irony
Healthy no need mask
THE say one some more let Healthy no need mask dun panic buy masks
around eight hundred deaths during the three months of oct nov dec I would say singapore is still among the best in probing counter measure for viral pandemic aside from new zealand and taiwan at the cost of those precious of is hopefully via data collection and analysis it could equip united states a much better arsenal to combat future pandemics and save our future generations
I want to know how they differentiate between people who die covid Also I want to know how many people who die or ken severe reaction from covid are fat unhealthy Sadly we will never know
Pinpoint china then they started it
August Ode kirk Does it matter Covid is still bad
Hah aha make measurement for the coffins coffin rolling on the floor laughing grinning squinting face
Hit the like button to commit not to take the booster
So are those one hundred over people who celebrated during EYE countdown in Clarke Quay arrested do not say one thing do another thing Catch badge lady but never catch these one hundred people
Big talk is one thing doing is another things So talk less do more will help
I think better you less talk and keep your mouth shut up the best thumbs up angry face with horns
Fanny Chop Well said thumbs up thumbs up
while freeloaders like you exploit subsidies made from high tax payer money
Good All three ministers answered the question well
useless incompetent ministers
You mean they regurgitated scripted answers to scripted questions well
Some fools have problems with comprehension
Just air Yes and unfortunately its you slightly smiling face
Is it the problem now VOL or people in Clarke Quay celebrating with no mask and safe distancing I think we all know the answer
Do you think Clark quay do take a look in shopping also not just that location everywhere is unable to control
No problem law Cases are under control Our hospitals are doing okay
None of them is a problem Both are solutions We need more cases to spread or else this will continue forever In US US Australia people are already living free lives
Amongst all the published measures to taken taken what has what is mental health measures taken by MON for citizens a those living a working with citizens in close quarters like maids etc
Well done yet again Singapore Following the chosen course steadily and steadfastly with small calibrations and without any knee jerk reactions This is good governance and good management
Well said thumbs up
When the Wuhan virus emerged everyone and you know will recover last China cannot fight Omicron even with Iron Man in charge Nature is teaching united states to be humble Learn or perish
A soon SO WILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF OMICRON CASES LIKE PREVIOUS DELTA CASES ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT THAT AS NORMAL AGain a treat it like catching cold who will want to come to so then even thru vol a local people will also afraid to go mall etc
Go and do your research and find out what is the different between Omicron is Delta do not listen to one side of the story WAKE UP
Population growth
Why is VIA not acknowledging the thousands of serious adverse jab effects sustained within a few weeks of the jab
Simple If everyone gets of of economy is gone case A jab got problem own self take care of own self
Prove it and show the medical significance
USeless ministers One hand say Omicron is very dangerous measures have to be in place The other hand Open VOL and import more Omicron Now we hitting all time high again
he thinks vaccine is the cure OAK is really dense
Enough of the government If you government closed the borders at the first and not just measurements the virus would a keep imported the virus in Just closed the border Why cannot closed because of money mouth face money mouth face money mouth face money bag money bag money bag
In an event if we have of OF A microns daily who would want to come to Singapore eventually
everyone of united states will be infected anyway new variant will keep coming until our bodies get use to it whats the difference be it a million cases or 10000cases since its not deadly get it early for a natural immune is better then anything
pro ten billions do not matter But if are that one out of a billion who actually lost a loved one it matters Agree
Shad Storm There is so many types of illness and different types of death that is more dangerous then covid that will affect everyone Hope this will give you some clue
Why is A continuing to restrict Singaporeans activities for fear of covid when it keeps importing new quarantined tourists with open legs
Because its only a matter of time before Singapore has a higher case rate than the countries you want to keep out Closed borders did not keep out delta either wHat are we to do ban imports and live off all the farmland we have here
Low exactly they need their pussy fix
They do not care anymore Only money
We cannot be closed can we Nobody owes united states a living
AMP COS YEAH BUT WHO SUFFERS more the people coming in to infect united states or people that stay here for years and years at some point repeating cliches like has to be put in its rightful context stop using it without realising the people who say it have their own selfish hidden greedy agenda this is not a private company this is a country we survived british colonisation japanese ocCupation and world war a we get to have a say too

Is MON finally going to tell US how many infected cases we have else US will categorise Singapore as unknown risk indefinitely
Pretty sure the US is just using it as a political excuse to punish united states for getting too close to china
Pretty sure singapore has less positive cases than the US which has hit one million cases
Of you gonna do about it in face of real power
Pokemon and For not taking their side For being neutral
Why bother about US when its in the best interest for their citizens to stay away from united states with them reporting a daily covid cases of one million
was pretty sure US is of of bigger than united states in terms of geography and population maybe get yourself educated before commenting nonsense
Pokemon and Not easy to stay neutral
The zionist So what Get some education on geography and history
was take Singapore cases and multiply by at least sixty then compare it to cases in US wE are not am not doing any better than US A few months back Singapore was having close to ask cases per day compared to ask all over the US wHo is doing worse if ratio of population is accounted for
Our MTG is doing well They had the situation under control And they ate well prepared Appreciate the hard work and good information Keep it up Well done
so rated unknown status by US A a CASUAL global laughing stock rolling on the floor laughing
The zionist Foreign trash
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing If that is so why always keep reminding united states not to overwhelm the healthcare You do not comprehend
Lucy Yes The vaccinated are likely to overwhelm the hospitals The science says
Lucy Yes Its you who don't comprehend What we are now facing is a universal problem the whole world is having the same dilemma tHe situation is totally hopeless in the uS that the army is deployed to help in their hospitals if you read the latest news you'll know iSrael us AUSTRALIA ARE NOW FOLLOWING OUR SINGAPORE METHOD OF HOME STAY RECOVERY ARE YOU A SINGAPOREAN IF YOU ARE CONSIDER YOURSELF DAMN LUCKy Just take a look at the neighbouring countries and their hospitals and you can start counting your blessings
Now are we telling the world Singapore have omicron Do the rest of the world going to live with Singapore and omicron As we are going to live with it
US is telling Singapore hello small boy You give united states the information not we ask for it or look for it ourselves
the US opened their vaccinated travel lane to the six african states a few weeks ago and immediately so followed blindly to allow vaccinated travel lane to those african states ALL
Who is US
Just air US A
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention cD is controlled by politicians and the VIA That was very obvious during the Trump Administration US not aware of the city states Covid of surveillance test numbers is their barefaced IS
the US opened their vaccinated travel lane to the six african states a few weeks ago and immediately so followed blindly also to allow vaccinated travel lane to those african states
So it is never easy to stay neutral and be a friend of US and China Get wise leaders
Give fake results to look good end up to blacklist by CD You think American as easy to smoke as docile Singaporean
Yes but before that this going to happen first One world government
Not many are awake like you That is exactly the agenda of covid and variants Covid was planned and executed to usher in the GREAT RESET aka the New World Order ONE WORLD GLOBAL GOVERNMENT controlled by the globalist Luciferin elites
Rapture Ready thanks folded hand medium light skin tone

You should move out of Asia to really live your life Asia will be under this for a generation and more and more Asian youths will migrate to the west
The Imperfect Perfectionist or singaporean can vote them out next general election
Sebastian Rousseau its happening in xian
A Saran is the best person to answer the questions relating to IT Is

Get the VOL going Omicron is not fatal if we have high vaccination rate
Don't be afraid just carry on living with covid treat its as endemic those who are worried just ask them to consult psychologist
Most of our life is normal already
TAriff Umbrian How to be normal when even just a New Year celebration can because them to invite those one hundred over people for coffee
Singapore have no resources at all keep closing border totally then people eat what iF you say money is not important then close door and lock yourself inside your house for you will not need to worry about infection anymore ask the whole country close down for what fOr us we still need to earn money to live on and support our family
You are absolutely right Economy is important Look at our neighbours They are suffering No income In fact so many suicides due to loss of earnings
Very clear direction and explanation compared to Australian government let us hope omicron will take over delta and be our way out of covid
We are proud of our Leaders
Meanwhile in THIs head Mar GET

Org la grinning squinting face grinning face with sweat rolling on the floor laughing
Just air Nice sarcasm

This April two thousand and twenty two will be two years since the beginning How much more will the MTG destroy SO
They are useless Need to step down They only know how to lock united states down We need to open the borders and go back to the normal life no mask no vaccine
The MTG is doing a very fine job We salute them Cool heads and visionary
Its already two years covid of started in Jan oF of mtg headed by the incompetent on be kun only has the vaccine solution Look at india early treatment help them overcome Delta and they are doing very well now
Just air No head exploding head no vision Any how hum tam
Lucy Yes Get vaccinated
A mockery session rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
What a laughing matter two shots will become no shot by fourteen this month forcing everybody to take the ord shot and then eth shot and then how many more years to live dElta and oMicron are nan size viruses they penetrate and transmit easily everywhere social distancing mask or no mask will be of no use sTupid people stupid measures
Today propaganda machine is hard at work Only this time it is not working for the far right it is working for the far left
I hope those audience stop asking stupid question folded hands outing face
Sad that Singaporeans blindly follow this leadership with no question The MTG HAS ALREADY AND WILL CONTINUE TO DESTROY THE ECONOMY OF so all talk and no action so will no longer be a hub and will soon become a tHIrd world country like its neighbours Just watch
A There's no doubt that you re not a Singaporean so mind your damn business Hub or no hub is not important not your business
one thousand nine hundred and eighty of sheep
A IF YOU ARE NON SINGAPOREAN BeTter you stop your nonsense pouting face and making such disgusting comment pouting face but if you are singaporean since you dislike singapore so much By all means geT yourself migrate to other there a necessity for you to criticize singapore until like That pouting face
Fanny Chop No genuine Singaporeans will ever say those vicious things like Singapore going back to ord world that kind of garbage a is definitely not a sIngaporean but a very spiteful jealous individual from a neighbouring country
one thousand nine hundred and eighty you don't know me yoU don't know anything about me i do know sO is a country built on MACs tAke one look at the skyline and dare you to say otherwise i Know that you don't like foreigners You blame foreigners for stealing jobs you simply don't have the skill set for My comments are sheer facts Your comments are based solely on emotion and anger lOok how angry you are What foreigner outperformed you in your workplace that you have such resentment The fact that you assume I am not Singaporean and or am from a surrounding country is hilarious and just outright sad for you wEre done talking Goodbye
Singapore government is an international disgrace and at this rate we will go back to third world
Fanny Chop Singaporeans have every right to criticize the government if you want a circle jerk please go to feb
Then their license would be revoked
The zionist I as a Singaporean also have the right to criticize you shameless and disgusting pouting face making criticism on Singapore pouting face
Fanny Chop you do have the rights but please all your comments are just unproductive criticisms It is disheartening to have this type of Singaporean that comments onto people based on their personal emotions doN't you know that your beloved grandfather sky was the first to import foreigners from china So why hate the foreigners knowing that your fore fathers might be a foreigner
ellis I am replying to individual comment pouting face better you mind your own business pouting face
Fanny Chop please don't cry sheep
A Foreign Bitch still barking
Make sure trillion dollars rich me I am money from Singapore make sure trillion dollars rich me
what language is that
item wake mixed with voodoo and a little bit of dun goo too
item I am equally confused like yourself Is this about or about omicron or about Singapore approach Still confused
Loll still do not strengthen all about money rolling on the floor laughing they tell you they are ready as they want rise IS They only concern for their pocket
Then the other side up govt for not opening up more and to
Find a lane and stick to it but they cannot even do that
Most of the negative comments come from foreigners who are dying to come to Singapore and now with all these restrictions going on many just badmouth So government genuine Singaporeans are grateful and know our government is doing all the best they can to help citizens so they don't complain
Ops Black Why so many more ungrateful and unwanted people like you are dying to come to Singapore
Ops Black Gee i've never had to make any real decision in life before hence why you think decisions in life have to binary
one thousand nine hundred and eighty highly doubt that the case you can continue to bury your ignorant head in the sand
Its almost like Singapore never faced a viral spread before but hey the highest paid ministers in the world can always fall back on the quintessential as a free get out of jail excuse
Please add philippines for VOL
For opening of granting free land vOL I would strongly propose that every buses and coaches be allowed to carry not more than of of its capacity All public transport must sterilize their vehicles after each crossings fOr every private vehicles it should only be allowed to carry not more than three pass including driver will be four persons all pass crossing either way in whatever kind of transport must be vaccinated tHat way safe distancing can be maintained Should also consider allowing Private Hire Cars registered only in JOb and singapore to carry passengers both ways so as to ease the lower carrying capacity of buses and coaches
I think we should just mind our own business st before putting our nose on other nations affair on how they want to proceed with the vaccinated travel lane
Yes agreed Worried about those corrupted country certificate of vaccinations travellers coming to malaysia dear So Plus plus get our he in order MTG
I do not know about all countries but INDIA is one champion of fake certs for all categories So plus be aware SpICA To I need to protect malaysia family folded hand folded hand folded hands

Dangling a carrot on a string in front our eyes
Bunch of pearson servers are having their usual fear fest in the comments I hope the government does is no real choice Life MUST go on
you cannot just open when we are yet to stabilized in our number of case Does money place a more important than human lives
Not a matter of money We cannot escape from the virus Live with it and join in the national effort
I agreed that we have to live with the virus but to the fact that they are ramping up so fast in opening is something that I do not understand
man Staying closed and being late have long term implications to our nations business which means the future generations may suffer
Jerry Money Why would we want to cut off our own survival
How are you doing today Hun man
Pretty sure the plan is for everyone to get the virus at some point Booster shot for the old so death rates wont be so high even if that means they go into ICE oNce everyone pretty much got it they can call it herd protection and just proceed to booster shot everyone and ensure everyone is got the antibodies so they don't end up in the ICE If everyone is infected but don't have much symptom and more like just the Flu everyone goes to normalcy person tipping hand light skin tone female sign tho tbs to bet that the virus wont mutate to something more deadly that's quite a risk to take Which seems like something the Govt is willing to take
Singapore so lucky to have PAP govt My country Malaysia is hopeless Give me PAP govt anytime

The covid infections among kids in the US A are increasing rapidly with of a of a cases per week on average
Hope from india also open for vaccinated valid MON pass holder
in of of a wait a reebok no king
India not trustworthy If they can fake education cert why not fake vaccination cert
Summer Gal when can open to China then why not India at least India not created Virus
Summer Gal It is possible to verify the authenticity of the vaccination certificates
A shay Made are sure can verify By the time it is detected or verified virus also came in too
Summer Gal In case someone detects positive even after presenting an authentic vaccination certificate there a provision to quarantine such a traveller No
Summer Gal Also I saw multiple comments from you suspecting the Air India and Air India Express flights arriving from India into Singapore daily being the because of increasing cases in Singapore If you still think so please read about a no way these Air India and Air India Express planes could carry even one passenger on incoming flights to Singapore hOpe you understand
A SHAY MADE ARE IF YOU RE A MULTI BILLIONAIRE PUTTING YOUR INVESTMENT HERE IN SINGAPORE WE WELCOME IF YOU RE THINking oF job opportunities here don't as we are still in recovery mode also we don't have enough hospItal bed to house covid cases from foreigners esp india being not in covid world meter stay in your own country or go elsewhere plus also don't bring your father or mother over too bring down your country covid cases first and don't pass the burden to other country thank you and hope you understand too interesting so these air india and air india express don't carry india citizens from india to singapore so empty planes and waste fuel huh if carried folks from other country will be interesting to know who took these planes
Summer Gal Yes the planes are empty from India to Singapore just to get the stranded citizens back to India like I said earlier unless there are any Singaporeans wanting to travel from India back to their homeland thEre blame you for this this pandemic has changed the way people think about each other now pEace
A SHAY MADE ARE SAY WHAT YOU WISH BUT SENTIMENT ON THE GROUND FROM MANY LOCALS TOWARDS YOUR COUNTRY MEN REMAIN UNCHANGED OUR GOVERNMENT HAS TO OPEN UP ECONOMY BECAUSE WE NEED INVESTMENT TO COME IN AND WE GLADLY WELCOME THEM HOWEVER IT IS A DIFFERENT BALL GAME FOR PEOPLE COMING FOR JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIGH RISk counTry like india
Summer Gal Very much understandable If I were in your place I might have had similar thoughts about this situation So I sincerely hope that the people from both the sides work in making the sentiment positive for each other And I pray for the well being of Singapore and its people folded hand medium light skin tone Talking about India the population is so humongous that keeping things in control is extremely difficult So I hope mass vaccinations help in some way Thankfully countries like Singapore have imposed a complete ban to avoid any cases from India getting in Not being defensive but India saw a massive outbreak during April to June this year but currently the number of cases is quite low
A shay Made are thank you and I hope all of united states emerge safely out from this global viral infection
Currently SO UNEMPLOYMENT TO NEEDS MORE WORKERS FROM INDIA TO DISPLACE LOCAL NOW WE NOW OPEN TO COUNTRIES WHICH ARE INVESTING in so first to create more jobs prohibited please wait six months for so covid situation to improve and hopefully everything return back to normaL
Eric Put I understand what you sure there would be many work pass holders from other regions as well
A SHAY MADE ARE OTHER SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE SAME AS INDIA CURRENTLY ONLY US US CANADA korea and eur next will be japan and rest of eur of our macs from these countries so we needs to start with these countries first we hope these macs will shift out some of their operations and jobs from china he since they Have power Outrage to india and so then that time we can bring In more workers from india into so beaming face with smiling eye also OUr WRonG also nEeds some TIme to increase hospital ice bedS and bring down our covid nineteen cases person face palming Somehow his luck like Jacky Chan
Eric Put Understandable Thanks for explaining your perspective I appreciate and respect your views
A shay Made are Mode doing an excellent deal with Taiwan Semi conductor investments in India Hopefully the deals would be successfully implemented as soon as possible thumbs up
Those working in airport need to take all type of vaccines for protection
Fact insists three shots will be needed for full vaccination after ADA advisory panel rejects universal Covid booster Does anyone here trust Face
Thank you MAPs for risking our life and bringing in more possible virus variants to this country
duncan risk life then stay at home la stay at home your whole life then will not get any virus maybe depression only
Just stay in your home you will feel safe
Silly replies residents are tied to home while tourists are free to roam freely Whose country a home does this belongs to
Seal Young any MAPs can say what they like Ultimately the residents are the one who suffer especially those who have young children and elderly with underlying illnesses And whenever there is a cluster the businesses are closed for cleansing and the livelihoods of these workers are affected When they cannot even handle the recent rising cases properly they still want to create more virus variants Here you show pitiful to the healthcare workers there you continue to subject them to more inpatients grinning squinting face clapping hand clapping hand clapping hands
Here they show concern about global warming and water conservation there they continue to kill more forest to build condominiums with swimming pool then build more underground tunnels that require more electrical powers for air on and train to run and then generate more warmth to the environment do not you think they NAT about all these concerns that they brought up in the past herE they mention about drop in fertility a marriage then how come got demands for more houses Of because to cater to the foreign investors but at the expense of damaging our precious land and forest
Tourist do not go out eVeryone else advised to minimal contact to protect yourself wad Can still get covid from fellow unlucky Singaporeans oR is it you oF WITH GETTING FROM SINGAPOREAN BUT NOT FROM TOURIST YOU THE Kind that just want to complain the government always going against you is it
Low use your brain its an Endemic
DanielS It is a pandemic not Endemic We are not the only country with this particular virus
Layla your reply shows you lack of life experiences to see through the issues
Justice Honest agree but we need to learn to live with it life goes on esp with of vaccination rate no point shutting off like a hermit crab our economy is dependent on free trade flow people services etc
Foreigner can come in easily but locals cannot even go on holidays without SHE after returning
Sure can travel to countries which SO have VOL with
Are we ready for mass infection scenario The gov needs to have a preparation plan for the people if they want to open up What next if we tested positive Where is the medicine that we can take to help ourself If we get infected hospital full quarantine at home to infect our love one Kids below twelve paRent of How many such family in the likely case scenario The gov appears unprepared for mass infection but they are steering united states toward the storm
Nus prof one of the experts worked on function gain with Wuhan Sure gov have confidence in opening up Maybe they know virus is just vaccination scam
Law liao law liao Must wear bio suits Liao
Cry to Insider Err
Seal Young I just saw ST report nEws sate him said review the rules for mask fatigue Some pal really have these and cannot be denied for me it of because i always at he but those who need to work needs rest from masks government should look into auto decontamination areas where individual can take down their mask to rest for of admins auto decontamination before the next person can use the facility as long as there is more then one person mask should always be on that the only way as vaccine does not work
Why still Indians not allowed

Good Job Singapore Many countries have already opened doors to travellers and tourists Those remaining closed will be left behind
SO is as good as waving the white flag
Seal Young Marching on towards death right
Seal Young thumbs up whether you like it or not the virus has made a home here on planet Earth By closing our borders we can have zero covid eventually Question is closed for how long is sufficient The minute we open up virus from other countries will come in So can we afford to close forever and ever with no ending Ask yourself if this is a workable solution Can we revert back to are covid time
Seal Young agreed totally
So vaccine and four swabs up malaysia nose to visit expensive forced masked Singapore No thanks Is already proven people with natural immunity have thirteen times better protection Than the vaccine
Its only deadly for old people anyway The world has to move on
Yes the world has to move on Closing is not an option
It can be deadly for people of all ages maybe worse for the elderly but younger people are not immune
Dennis Blood of And for economic reasons all countries including NO and Australia will open up China could be the exception
IS Lin True But the statement remains false We have to move on but not being guided by misinformation Statements like that will only promote complacency amongst the young
Dennis Blood of Of course anyone young or old can succumb but we have to read data too to be prepared

To Mark Thanks for sharing
De Chan Wrong nO vaccine protects against infection vaCcines protect against the effects of infection This is why rates of death and serious illness are so much lower amongst vaccinated people compared to vaccinated
Dennis Blood of so

The CECA would be glad to come in eagerly to fulfill the agreement

Focus Good but have you thought thru the implication of your suggestion the practicality and feasibility as well as the economic and social impact of each of your recommendation

CD Hawk eye that's the reality we need to address immediately Either we die through virus infection or we die by suicide or we die and become hungry ghost
Summer Gal When faced with these not so good choices created by the virus we should take the best one and be ready for the battle to earn back normalcy Well cannot be like before follow our leaders to get the best out of a bad situation
Good the world cant go on like this anymore for such a mild virus
Vaccine works hor
Vaccines is not of a but life cannot be of a guaranteed if we closed
IS Lin this is how a failure is been brain wash
On Ernie Just face them with precautions
What about incubating patients who test negative on arrival and subsequently test positive More mixing of the gene pool means increased chances of new variants Do the opening slowly
How do you not see that they are opening slowly Snails pace
Is Israel traveller part of the opening for green lane
Step by step well get there

RED Carpet Welcome Lambda a My both RESISTANT To Vaccines Booster Jab am not are not Gonna Save A just put Or Life at Higher Risk
i agree to a certain degree Opening carefully is important rather than believing only in vaccines which are not strong enough to cope with different variants at first the concept of living with coVid of as endemic sounds of but how its executed leaves a lot to be desired
Cases rising but you should be asking how many are critically ill Having it circulate around the community is not stay shuttered First steps are scary for Singaporeans I know
Mike A less thanks for the insight next few weeks we hoping things would be good by before Xmas so that we can all celebrate more happily in small groups of coz
Wong Francis Prolonged lock down have proven to impact on mental health The bottom line is vaccination had proven that infected people are less prone to serious diseases and symptoms
Allen Cha I was thinking if we are vaccinated and still kana its not so bad after all of coz nobody likes to get it So long as we are all vaccinated and keep our symptoms to the minimum the world could indeed open up more
Please do not open until two thousand and thirty
wat at tourism which is also a major foreign income
